        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.\n\nCNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.\n\nRamos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms \u2013 perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement\u2019s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.\n\nCruz\u2019s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.\n\nHis mother told investigators she was \u201cespecially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time\u201d and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.\n\nCruz\u2019s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he \u201cthreatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would \u2018shoot the school,\u2019\u201d according to the affidavit.\n\nThe mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle \u2013 the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Cruz \u201cdenied making any threats\u201d when interviewed by a detective, the document states.\n\nCNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney.

Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.\n\nBoeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.\n\nIn 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.\n\nCEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.\n\nHe said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operators dedicated to Airbus planes.\n\nSpirit's CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.",

Farmers can lease their land to solar energy developers, diversifying their income streams while maintaining agricultural activities on the remaining areas. This symbiotic relationship supports sustainable development by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption.\n\nGoogle will partner with BlackRock to develop a 1 gigawatt pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan, the U.S. tech giant announced Monday as it seeks to boost energy capacity and cut carbon emissions amid the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe deal will see Google make a capital investment, yet to be approved by regulators, in Taiwanese solar developer New Green Power \"to facilitate the buildout of its large-scale solar pipeline.\"\n\nGoogle did not reveal how much it was investing into New Green Power, a BlackRock portfolio firm.\n\nThe investment will boost clean energy on Taiwan's local electricity grid, and help Google reach its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030, the company said.\n\nThe new solar capacity will help power Google's data centers and cloud region in Taiwan, the press release said.

        "title": "Collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is about to unload $9 billion of coins onto the market. Here's what it means",
        "body": "Omer Taha Cetin | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nA bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users \u2014 and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoin, or upward of $58 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.\n\nCNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoin \u2014 or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding \u2014 are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.\n\nPressure on bitcoin could pick up\n\nMt. Gox \u2014 short for \"Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange\" \u2014 was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. Today, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $61,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in-kind \u2014 that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent \u2014 have seen the value of their coins surge over 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. \"Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,\" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. \"Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,\" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has \"long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin.\" \"Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,\" said Butterfill.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's \"fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks.\" Similarly, JPMorgan analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. \"Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,\" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 \u2014 worth approximately $305.8 million as of Thursday's prices \u2014 of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.\n\nwatch now\n\nMt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin\n\nMost analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. \"I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short-term,\" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. \"Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,\" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. \"Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,\" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst, Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. \"Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nRecent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, \"it will have a market impact.\" \"Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,\" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be \"dissipated,\" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the \"significant amount\" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. \"Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,\" he told CNBC.\n\nMacro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall\n\nIt's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.\n\nBut investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple cuts it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among \"the likely culprits for the recent price decline\" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is \"likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,\" Butterfill said. However, \"the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,\" he added.",

        "body": "Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.\n\nDemocrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.\n\n\"Yes, it was a bad performance,\" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.\"\n\nThe South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,\" Clyburn said.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.\n\nDespite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.\n\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.\n\nA poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.\n\nBut those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.\n\n\"I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,\" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. \"Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.\"\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.\n\nUltimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.\n\nBiden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.\n\nIn the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.\n\nMunoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.",

        "body": "The budding trends in food sound like a return to the diet of cavemen: Fish is the hottest protein, honey is the flavor du jour and game meat is an upgrade to charcuterie boards. That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:\n\nHoney \u2014 as a flavor\n\nOwl Creek Organics & Natural Products' lineup of honey spreads at the Summer Fancy Foods Show Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nHumans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.\n\nTinned fish\n\nKrill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nIn years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.\n\nFish to go\n\nAcme Smoked Fish's Lox in a Box kits on display at the company's booth Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nExhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named \"satisfying snacks\" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.\n\nUpgraded charcuterie\n\nFossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nLike tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie \u2014 especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.\n\nPairing snacks\n\nWine Chips' Sel Gris-flavored chips are meant to be paired with sparkling wines Amelia Lucas | CNBC",

Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.\n\n\"We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport.

        "title": "How long you may live is one of retirement planning's biggest unknowns. How experts say to get the best estimate",
        "body": "Peopleimages | Istock | Getty Images\n\nTo effectively plan for your retirement, experts say, you need to watch your savings rate and total nest egg. But how much you really need to have set aside depends on another number \u2014 your life expectancy. Yet that figure is also the most elusive \u2014 no one knows how long they will live. \"Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,\" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries. The financial industry typically uses age 95 as a default assumption, according to research from HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software. More from Personal Finance:\n\nWhy inflation is still upending retirement plans\n\nOlder voters want candidates who will protect Social Security\n\nWorkers in certain industries tend to have higher 401(k) balances Instead of planning for one life expectancy number, the Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries emphasize longevity. Longevity risk measures the likelihood someone may live longer than expected and outlive their savings. \"If you read that life expectancy is 84 and you are planning on your money lasting until 84, there's a big surprise behind the curtain that you haven't opened,\" Schilling said. \"There's a really good chance for a lot of reasons that you might need your money to last longer than that.\"\n\nLongevity estimates may bring surprises\n\nThe Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries recently relaunched a free online longevity illustrator. The tool asks for basic information on either an individual or a couple: age, sex, retirement age, smoking status and a description of their general health \u2014 poor, average or excellent. The results aim to provide a \"reasonable\" estimate of how long you might live, according to the organizations. The illustrations show the probability of living to certain ages, as well as the number of years of life one might live in retirement. Generally, the higher your current age, the greater the possibility you may live longer. While life expectancy at birth may be 84, it will be even longer if you've already made it to age 65, Schilling said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe results may help individuals fully understand the range of possibilities when planning for how long their money may need to last, she said. For couples, there is also another revelation that often comes as a surprise. \"The chance that at least one of you lives to 90 is even bigger,\" Schilling said. Yet the financial industry's assumption of living to age 95 may be too generous, according to recent research from HealthView Services. The projected life expectancy for someone who is 65 years old today with no chronic conditions is age 90 for women and age 88 for men. Yet only around 5% of people over 60 have no chronic conditions, according to the research.\n\nHealth status affects life expectancy projections\n\nChronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity or Parkinson's disease reduce an individual's projected life expectancy. For example, while a healthy 65-year-old man with no chronic conditions has a 19.3% probability of living to age 95 or longer, that gets reduced to a 17.5% chance if he has high blood pressure, 15.8% if he has cardiovascular disease, 12.5% for high cholesterol, 8.8% for obesity with a body mass index of 35 to 39, 7.4% for tobacco use, 2% for obesity with body mass index of 40 to 44 and to just 0.4% for diabetes, according to the research. Those probabilities could mean a huge difference to his retirement funding needs. A healthy 65-year-old man may need around $1.1 million to maintain the 80% income replacement rate he needs if he was earning $100,000 in 2023, according to HealthView Services. This assumes he lives to age 95, has a 6% annual portfolio return, receives Social Security benefits, and inflation is 3%.\n\nHowever, if that 65-year-old man has a chronic condition, his life expectancy will be lower. And that could free up more of that retirement nest egg to be spent in other ways, according to HealthView Services. High blood pressure could reduce his life expectancy by nine years to age 86, and therefore allow for $447,469 to be used for long-term care planning, emergency savings, money for heirs or other uses, the research found. Tobacco use could reduce his life expectancy by 13 years to 82, freeing up $616,245, the research estimates, while diabetes may reduce his lifespan by 16 years, enabling him to spend $727,947. Most experts advise individuals to plan for outliving their assets by delaying Social Security retirement benefits or considering an annuity to amplify monthly income.\n\nHow personalized numbers can help",

        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe largest utility companies in the U.S. are warning that the nation is facing a surge of electricity demand unlike anything seen in decades, and failure to rapidly increase power generation could jeopardize the nation's economy. After a more than decade-long period of largely flat growth, electricity demand is poised to skyrocket by 2030 as the artificial intelligence revolution, the expansion of chip manufacturing, and the electrification of the vehicle fleet all coincide as the U.S. is trying to address climate change. The tech sector's build out of data centers to support AI and the adoption of electric vehicles alone is expected to add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, according to a report released by the consulting firm Rystad Energy this week. The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad. \"This growth is a race against time to expand power generation without overwhelming electricity systems to the point of stress,\" said Surya Hendry, a Rystad analyst, in a release following the report's publication.\n\n'The stakes are really, really high'\n\nThe major tech players \u2013 Amazon , Alphabet's Google unit, Microsoft and Meta \u2013 are urgently requesting more power as they bring data centers online that in some cases require a gigawatt of electricity, said Petter Skantze, vice president of infrastructure development at NextEra Energy Resources. To put that in context, a gigawatt is equivalent to the capacity of nuclear reactor. NextEra Energy , parent of Skantze's subsidiary, is the largest power company in the S&P utilities sector by market capitalization and it operates the biggest portfolio of renewable energy assets in the nation. \"This is a different urgency coming. They need this load to drive the next iteration of growth,\" Skantze told the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference in New York City this week. \"They're showing up now at the utility and they're banging on the door and they're saying I need to put this resource on the grid,\" the executive said.\n\nA big challenge will be whether enough resources are available to connect those large data center projects to the power grid, Skantze said. The stakes are high for the U.S. economy, the executive said. \"If I can't get that power capacity online, I cannot do the data center. I cannot do the manufacturing. I can't grow the core businesses of some of the largest corporations in the country,\" Skantze said. \"The stakes are really, really high. This is a new environment. We have to get this right.\" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors earlier this month that U.S. power demand will increase by 38% over the next two decades, a fourfold increase over the annual rate of growth in the previous 20 years. NextEra expects much of the demand to be met by renewables and battery storage, Ketchum said. The company has a 300-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and storage projects.\n\n'Energy security brings national security'\n\nSouthern Company , the second-largest utility in the U.S. by market cap, is also seeing a historic wave of electricity demand. The power company is headquartered in Atlanta, one of the fastest growing data center markets in the U.S. with 723 gigawatts under construction in 2023, up 211% over the prior year, according to real estate services firm CBRE. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack said the company is seeing a level of demand not seen since the advent of air conditioning and heat pumps in the South in the 1970s and 1980s. The utility is expecting demand to grow by three or four times, he said. \"A lot of this is dependent and contingent upon what we see with artificial intelligence and all those large learning models and what data centers will consume,\" Womack said. \"You're also seeing in the Southeast, this incredible population growth and you're seeing all this onshoring with manufacturing.\" Supplying the demand with reliable power is a matter of economic and national security, Womack said. Southern expects 80% of the demand through the end of the decade to be met by renewables, he said.",

        "body": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\n\nFor 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.\n\nMost recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver \"The Blind,\" \"The Chosen,\" \"Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist\" and \"Waitress: the Musical\" to audiences. Still to come is \"Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.\"\n\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.\n\nFathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach \u2014 as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains \u2014 has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.\n\n\"Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.\"\n\nIn post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.\n\nSeason 4 of \"The Chosen,\" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.\n\n\"'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,\" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. \"It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.\"\n\nFathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.\n\n\"We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,\" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. \"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.\"\n\nThis year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" as well as the 35th anniversary of \"Steel Magnolias.\" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of \"Blazing Saddles,\" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" the 40th anniversary of \"Neverending Story\" and the 20th anniversary of \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIt also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" the 35th anniversary of \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and the 30th anniversary of \"Pom Poko.\"\n\nAnd these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.\n\nFathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,\" Bagby said. \"We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.\"\n\n4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.\n\nAudiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Coraline,\" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.\n\nFathom re-released \"Coraline\" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\nThat $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for \"Coraline\" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.\n\nWhat's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.\n\n\"New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.\n\nFathom reports presales for this year's screenings of \"Coraline\" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.\n\nBecause Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.\n\n\"[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,\" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. \"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.\"",
        "summary": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever.\n\"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way.\nLast year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves.",

        "title": "Here are our top 3 and bottom 3 stocks during a divergent second quarter",
        "body": "It was another largely great quarter for the stock market \u2014 completing a strong first half of the year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq , all trading around record highs. The Nasdaq was the big winner of the second quarter, adding 8.26% over the past three months thanks to an artificial intelligence-powered tech rally. The S & P 500 gained 3.92% since the end of March. The Dow, on the other hand, closed out the April through June period in the loss column \u2014 ending down 1.73%. The Dow is not as heavily weighted in tech, which was the top-performing sector in Q2. Here's a look at the three best second-quarter performers among the 33 stocks in the CNBC Investing Club portfolio and the three worst. Best Performers NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Nvidia continued to be the top-performing stock in the portfolio for the second quarter in a row, gaining 36.73%. The major contributor to the upside was a blowout fiscal 2025 first quarter accompanied by strong current quarter guidance. During the post-earnings call in May, the risk of a so-called air pocket in sales momentum as the company transitions to its new Blackwell chip architecture was taken off the table . Management said demand for the yet-to-be-released platform already outstrips supply. Last week, if only briefly, Nvidia became the most valuable U.S. company. After record high after record high, the stock pulled back recently. On Wednesday, at Nvidia's annual shareholders meeting, founder and CEO Jensen Huang took questions and laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its lead position in enabling AI. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD The second big winner was Apple , which rose 22.82% in Q2. The stock didn't do much in the first month of the second quarter. However, all that changed in early May when the company reported solid earnings . Services revenue was better than expected and China was nowhere near as bad as feared. That got the stock going. But the real break out to all-time highs followed the company's AI announcements at this month's Worldwide Developers Conference. Shares took that other leg up, in our view, because Apple Intelligence will only be available on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models or better. That means the vast majority of iPhone users, who we know to be extremely loyal to the brand, have a better reason than ever before to upgrade their devices. We expect many to do so. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD Broadcom came in third and saw its stock advance 21.13% in April through June. After consolidating for much of the quarter, the stock started jumping earlier this month on strong quarterly results and management raising their outlook for AI-related revenue generation. Investors also came away with increased confidence that the legacy aspects of the business were bottoming and set to rebound into the back half of the year. That confidence also makes sense when considering that Broadcom is a key Apple supplier. So any outsized AI-upgrade cycle that Apple sees is going to translate into a strong cycle for suppliers like Broadcom as well. Worst Performers EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD Estee Lauder was the worst name of the second quarter for the Club portfolio, losing 30.98%. The stock was largely rangebound in April, however, the negative momentum took hold once again when shares got punished for its light guidance. Management's disappointing outlook sparked fresh concerns over the pace of the recovery in Asia Travel Retail. While the report was largely positive and we did see signs of an inflection playing out, these concerns on the pace and magnitude of the recovery continue to weigh on shares. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD The second worst performer was Disney , which dropped 18.85% in April through June. Disney started to drift back down after management won its proxy fight to keep activist investor Nelson Peltz off the company board. Peltz, who had a big stake in Disney, exited the position. The stock then took another hit on lackluster earnings , in which the company missed expectations on the top line. While noting that Disney's combined direct-to-consumer (DTC) business is still on the path to profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024 in September, the current quarter would see pressure resulting seasonal weakness attributable to its streaming offering in India, known as Disney+ Hotstar. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD The third worst performer of the quarter was Stanley Black & Decker , with an 18.42% decline. While shares recovered post-earnings losses quickly, they subsequently reversed back down and now sit below where the level reached in the selloff after the quarterly numbers were release in early May. At least some of that pressure was likely caused by a rebound in longer-term bond yields, which kept borrowing costs high. We view Stanley Black & Decker as our play on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which when they happen, should lower mortgages and boost the housing market. Stanley Black & Decker was one of nine stocks featured in our Fed rate cut stocks commentary. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,\" he said.\n\nAfter North Carolina, the president flew to New York to deliver remarks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center to mark Pride Month. Later that evening, he held several campaign receptions.\n\nBiden will participate in even more campaign receptions on Saturday in New York and New Jersey before returning to Camp David later in the evening. Those events will likely boost the $27 million fundraising figure higher.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how much of this new fundraising came from grassroots donors online versus higher-dollar donors.\n\nSince the 90-minute face-off on Thursday, Democrats have been in a frenzy trying to clean up the mess of Biden's debate flop.\n\nBiden supporters, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have tried to spin the debate by recognizing, rather than ignoring the president's debate blunders while also asking voters to look past them.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, however, are calling on Biden to drop out of the presidential race and forfeit his delegates to a fresh candidate.\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled to debate again on Sept. 10, a potential redemption opportunity for the president's perception with voters, many of whom express concerns over his age and ability to handle a second term.",

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.\n\nAs a result, before \"Inside Out 2,\" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\nWhile this audience came out in droves for Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's \"The Garfield Movie\" and Paramount's \"IF.\"\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.\n\nAs the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.\n\nNext up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's \"Despicable Me 4,\" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.",

        "title": "Amazon is doubling value of credits for some startups to build on AWS as Microsoft cloud gains ground",
        "body": "Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.\n\nAmazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.\n\nStarting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.\n\nTwo people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.\n\nMatt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.\n\nAWS confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley, and said that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years. A company spokesperson called AWS the leader in cloud \"by a wide margin,\" adding that over 280,000 startups run on AWS, including 96% of \"unicorns\" in AI and machine learning.\n\n\"These new programs are simply us doubling down on this incredible momentum,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.\n\nBut Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.\n\nAmazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.\n\nLast month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft \"ran laps around\" AWS in generative AI.\n\nStartups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIn November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.\n\nStartups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.\n\nIn addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. \"Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,\" Adept said in a blog post.\n\nAWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021.\n\nWATCH: AWS will boost investments in Singapore's cloud infrastructure by $9 billion",

        "title": "Move over, remote jobs. CEOs say borderless talent is the future of tech work",
        "body": "To work remotely or not is no longer the question. Experts say it's borderless hiring for technology roles that is stealing the conversation.\n\n\"Remote is like the gateway drug to borderless,\" said Jeremy Johnson, CEO of AI-enabled tech talent marketplace Andela, whose customers include Goldman Sachs, Github and Coursera. \"Once you realize that you don't have to all be in the same office five days a week in order to build a compelling culture and feel connected to the mission and solve complex problems, you then start thinking there are great people all over the world.\"\n\nWith tech leaders focusing concurrently on innovation and value-driven efficiency, tech hiring that eclipses national or even global time zone delineation is a growing phenomenon. Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey. By 2022, the tech talent workforce in cities like Beijing and Delhi far outweighed that of U.S. powerhouses like San Francisco and New York, reports CBRE Global Tech Talent Guidebook 2024. The report cites burgeoning tech talent markets like Bucharest, Romania; Cape Town, South Africa; Cebu City, Philippines; Nairobi, Kenya and more.\n\nGlobal hiring is an example of a luxury that's moving down the value chain, Johnson said. Much like services such as Uber increased access to what is essentially a private driver on demand, talent marketplaces and a digitized workforce make global hiring more than just a pricey C-suite search.\n\nGlobal payment processing platform Payoneer has its hands in the borderless hiring world from an internal perspective (with about 2,200 employees in 50 countries and more than 25 offices globally), but it also benefits from and drives the borderless trend with its clients.\n\n\"The rhetoric about the globalized opportunity is powerful, but it doesn't make any difference to the business you're doing unless you actually have the utilities and tools to do it,\" said Payoneer CEO John Caplan.\n\nPockets of talent worldwide\n\nAdam Jackson, CEO of decentralized tech talent platform Braintrust, does borderless differently. \"We don't have a physical office,\" he said. \"Everyone works remotely. Every engineer but one who works on Braintrust is outside of the U.S.\" Braintrust's clients, from NASA to Nestl\u00e9, are building borderless teams, too, Jackson says.\n\n\"It was the case maybe 20 years ago when I moved to San Francisco that the best tech, best developers, best product managers and designers all lived here in Silicon Valley,\" Jackson added. \"That's just not true anymore. There are still many here, but there are pockets all over the world.\"\n\nSome leaders, like Johnson, believe time zone coordination is still important to provide certain employees with the opportunity to work synchronously. Jackson, however, has the viewpoint that global innovation with an asynchronous workforce is a chance to create a company \"where the sun never sets.\"\n\nWhile there are questions about work-life balance, Jackson says that doesn't exist in startup culture anyway, but that asynchronous work can increase clarity in documentation and minimize the endless treadmill of meetings, leaving more time for creative thinking and deep work.\n\nJohnson says local labor laws, compliance and payroll are all factors at play in global operations, which is why many organizations have opened centers in specific countries. But even these obstacles aren't insurmountable.\n\nAI and future of work geographies\n\nOne thing these experts agree on is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to borderless hiring. \"Every company has to find their own bespoke solution,\" Caplan said. \"You have to design your office footprint, your future-of-work philosophy to the business you're building.\"\n\nThinking about artificial intelligence innovation and, on the flip side of the same coin, AI regulation, Johnson says the European Union's standard-setting regulatory framework will make it tough for tech operations to thrive. As more regulatory and case law settles around the globe surrounding AI and data, cross-border employment trends will shift like puzzle pieces.\n\n\"I think Europe is going to have a really tough time over the next few years,\" he said. \"They're pushing a lot of data innovation out of the continent, and I think that's an opportunity for Africa and Latin America and other parts of the world.\"\n\nRegardless of where organizations hire, Jackson emphasizes the importance of managing risk and hiring good people. \"Quality still matters,\" he said. \"The old adage is when you're building software, do you want to be fast, good quality, or cheap? Pick two. Now, I reject that. You can have all three, but quality still matters, no matter where you are.\"\n\nCaplan relishes in the more altruistic potential of borderless employment, namely its ability to \"lift up communities around the globe.\" This may be true, but at the very least, its benefits for expanded talent reach and cost effectiveness are enough for leaders in all kinds of industries to take it on. With applications for standard work-sponsored visas in the U.S. up 263% in 2023 compared to the year prior, according to Deel's latest Tech Migration Report, and U.S. cities accounting for the top five average monthly apartment rent costs, borderless hiring could ease the burden for employment seekers and employment providers in one\n\n\"If you could make your single biggest expense, which is talent, 10% more efficient, you have a dramatic advantage,\" Johnson said. Borderless hiring, it seems, will continue to infiltrate the growth playbook at all levels.",

        "body": "In this article EXPE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nNearly two in three workers around the world are \"vacation deprived,\" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's \"Vacation Deprivation Report\" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days \u2014 27 days and 29 days, respectively \u2014 in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel \"vacation deprived\" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.\n\nThe survey \u2014 Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic \u2014 shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.\n\nWhat's happening in France and Germany?\n\nExpedia's report indicates that feeling \"vacation deprived\" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. \"The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,\" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. \"This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAmong Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. \"This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,\" she said, adding that \"vacation deprivation\" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.\n\nWasted vacation days\n\nDespite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.\n\nHong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. \"In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,\" said Hudson. \"It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally.\" That could mean that \"those few extra days here and there are overlooked,\" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.\n\nOne big break vs. many mini-breaks",

        "body": "A screen displays stock figures at the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. headquarters in Taipei, Taiwan, on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nOptimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn \u2014 traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry \u2014 jumped 105% in the same period. \"The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,\" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.\n\nJapan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.\n\nwatch now\n\nGhosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible \u2014 and considerable \u2014 impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy \"in a gradual and measured way.\" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. \"We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates.\" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets \u2014 Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.\n\nAll eyes on the Fed\n\nMost central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent \"dot plot\" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nwatch now\n\nRate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a \"reasonable prediction\" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. \"We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.\"\n\nwatch now",

Mario Tama | Getty Images\n\nwatch now\n\nAir traffic, extreme weather The Federal Aviation Administration has found a shortage of up to 3,000 needed air traffic controllers. Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination. Based on air traffic patterns and airport density, New York City and Florida are subject to the highest risk of backups. The massive heat wave across the U.S. was a peek at the kind of extreme weather that can lead to travel issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects disruptive weather for the holiday week, with storms across the Midwest and East Coast, and continuing dangerous heat in the Southwest and interior Northeast. Extreme temperatures cause technical failures that result in delays. High heat creates thin air, which hampers the plane's thrust for takeoff and ascent. That means airplanes need more runway for takeoff or a lighter aircraft \u2014 by removing baggage or passengers. And it means that very high temperatures increase the risk of flight cancellations. The best bet to avoid this risk is to take early morning and late-night flights. Good news to reduce travel anxiety If travelers prepare and secure backup plans, they can make the best out of the busy summer season. And despite travel anxiety and a cascade of uncertain factors, travel expert and managing editor at The Points Guy, Clint Henderson, says airlines and airports are so far showing signs of being better prepared than past years. Despite May issues and despite some airlines pulling back on overall hiring plans compared to past years, in part due to Boeing delays, Henderson said, \"We have not seen the major meltdowns that we saw a couple of years ago. And I think part of the reason for that is the airlines and the airports, and everyone from Uber to rental car companies, you know, you name it, everyone staffed back up.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nUnited Airlines has projected a 7% increase in flyers from the 2023 Independence Day week, and is adapting with new staff. American Airlines is slated for 10% more summer departures year over year. Improvements in coordination for air traffic controllers are also taking place. \"The federal government and local ATC towers have been working together better, and that includes the military. They've opened up military airspace to help accommodate the crowd, so we have seen snarls,\" Henderson said. \"There is still a shortage of air traffic controllers, but it hasn't led to the worst outcomes that we were expecting when we were talking about the shortage of air traffic control workers even a year ago.\" That said, he warns that in severe weather, a shortage of air traffic control may still worsen delays for travelers. Tips for Independence Day travel With lower-than-expected prices, many more flyers this summer are infrequent flyers, who should start by signing up for airline apps which may offer them some introductory benefits, starting with miles and extending to free WiFi on some flights. Henderson said the easiest ways to save hours of wait times include signing up for programs that offer passengers faster movement through security, including TSA PreCheck and Clear, as well as the no-application-required Mobile Passport Control app, which allows users to go through an expedited U.S. Customs lane. He also recommended the \"Flighty\" tracker app, or similar flight tracker, to stay on top of options in the event flight status changes. Flyers need to also stay on top of the routes that the planes they plan to take are already traveling on, to catch issues at other airports which could ultimately cause a cascade of cancellations. \"If your flight gets canceled, you're competing with all those people on that plane to get on the next available flight. So if you have a head start on those people, you're going to be the winner,\" Henderson said. When it comes to traveling during peak season, \"Information is power,\" he said. Cheaper airfares may not be here to stay Airfares are down, but many factors influence price, from the specific destination of a traveler, with wide variation in prices depending on route, to how far in advance tickets are purchased, midweek travel versus weekend dates, and what additional fees (e.g. baggage) may push up the total cost of travel significantly. In addition, with issues lingering in the supply of new planes, from Boeing production being curtailed by the FAA to Airbus running into supply chain snafus, the recent dip in fares may not last too long. Henderson eventually expects price hikes from airlines related to increasing maintenance costs and reduced fleet capacity. Labor costs and fuel costs per flight skyrocketed in the past year. With production delays, airlines pay billions to fly less fuel-efficient and more costly and aged jets. Technical issues are more common on older plans and increase delays as well. On June 26, Southwest Airlines cut its second-quarter revenue forecast while citing booking concerns. The firm announced a decline in expected revenue per seat per mile, and fuel costs increasing up to 7.5% year over year. But for now, even with rising costs, flight prices have yet to return to their summer 2023 peaks, and consumers are taking advantage. Henderson said many last-minute travel deals that airlines are offering this summer are still available. Even if the security lines are long, prices on many routes should not weigh travelers down. Hopefully, neither will delays and cancellations.",

        "body": "A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.\n\nDividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.\n\nInvestors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.\n\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nThe first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.\n\nDarden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.\n\nSaleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.\n\n\"We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,\" said Saleh.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)\n\nInternational Seaways\n\nNext up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.\n\nFollowing meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.\n\nAccordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.\n\nNolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). \"We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,\" said the analyst.\n\nNolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nCitigroup\n\nFinally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThe bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.\n\nFollowing the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.\n\nRamsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.\n\n\"The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,\" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.\n\nRamsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%. (See Citigroup Technical Analysis on TipRanks)",

For the third year in a row, Vienna, Austria, ranked as the world's best city to live. On the opposite side of the world, not a single city in the U.S. ranked in the top 20 places to live. The report noted that a trend in the U.S. this year is smaller cities outperforming the bigger metropolitan areas. Two of the more popular cities in America, New York and Los Angeles didn't rank in the top 10 \u2014 they came in 70th and 58th, respectively.\n\nHonolulu is the best U.S. city to live in\n\nFor the second year in a row, Honolulu ranked as the best U.S. city to live in, according to the EIU. It ranked 23 on the global list, up from No. 25 in 2023.

M Swiet Productions | Moment | Getty Images\n\nLiving in Honolulu also means living in a city in one of the most expensive states in the U.S., according to CNBC's America's Top States for Business study. It ranked highly based on an index of prices for a range of goods and services. The cost of living in Hawaii is high because of several factors, including the fact that so many items on the island are imported. According to that CNBC study, gas prices in the state are among the nation's highest. Honolulu is also the western metro area with the biggest rent increase for 1-bedroom apartments in a year. Rent in the area went up by 3.3% from $1,783 in 2023 to $1,841 in 2024, according to rent estimate data from Apartment List for April 2023 to April 2024, analyzed by CNBC Make It.\n\nThe 10 best cities to live in the U.S.\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii Atlanta, Ga.

Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. \"Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.\n\n\"I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,\" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.\n\nThroughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.\n\nThe messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.\n\nMuch of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.\n\n\"As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,\" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. \"I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.\n\nBiden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: \"Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.\"\n\nBut debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.\n\nThis year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.\n\nIn the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.\n\nThe Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.",

        "body": "At 32, after 12 years of living rent-free with my parents in the San Francisco Bay area, I was ready to move into my own place. I had saved $400,000 and had the flexibility to make the leap, but whether it was uncertain streams of income, wanderlust and mostly, the financial benefits of staying put, something had been holding me back. Until November 2023, when I visited a friend at their Fremont, California, apartment complex. When I walked in, it felt like home. As fate would have it, as I was leaving, I met my friend's neighbors, a couple breaking their lease. My gut told me that this was the right moment. After a few hours and some paperwork, I secured a four-month sublease agreement from them for $2,000 a month. It was the perfect transitional space. Once my sublease was up, in April, I moved into a 556-square-foot studio in the same complex for $2,146 a month. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online The building is 10 minutes away from the studio I built off of my parent's place where I teach my music students, and less than a 10 minute drive from two beloved local Costco stores. That might seem like an odd amenity to look for in real estate, but to me, it was a huge asset. Altogether, I have spent over $5,000 to outfit my place almost entirely with Costco products.\n\nTaking a break in my living room. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nWhy Costco means so much to me\n\nCostco was a shopping staple for my family when I was growing up. And back in 2013, I started going all the time after work, to browse the aisles and try out samples while waiting out the rush hour traffic. Over time, Costco has become more than just a store to me \u2014 it's a place for me to belong and feel like myself. My love for it inspired me to create my Instagram account, Costco Claudia. Since launching in winter of 2022, Costco Claudia has become a creative outlet and an income stream. On the account, I primarily post videos of myself modeling women's clothing in the store, and I currently have 191,000 followers and counting. While I have never worked directly with or for Costco, I have had partnerships with brands that are sold by the company.\n\nMe in front of one of my favorite local Costco's. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI currently make about $7,000 a month as an influencer and $5,000 a month from my job as a piano teacher. One of the most surprising and gratifying parts of this experience has been the incredible positivity I've received from my Costco Claudia community. They offered so much comfort and solidarity when I felt most alone, particularly as I learned about my PMDD and navigated living on my own. Their support has helped me through some of my toughest times.\n\nTake a look inside my cozy California studio\n\nFor utilities, I spend about $102 a month: $27 for water and trash collection, $30 for internet, and $45 for electricity. Take a look inside: My kitchen is a space to fuel up and get ready for the day Over the years, I've collected a bunch of discounted stuff from Costco sales: glasses, plates, bowls, my NutriBullet, a Brita filter, and loads of snacks.\n\nOne of my favorite items in my kitchen is my coffee machine. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nWhat I really rely on in my kitchen are my coffee machine and the garage \"work table\" \u2014 both found at Costco \u2014 which doubles as my kitchen table. It's sturdy and looks great with the faux fur sheepskins I use to cover my chairs.\n\nThis work table is one of my favorite finds. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI surround myself with greenery and music in my living room After a long day of teaching, I enjoy winding down in my cozy living room. My forest of growing monsteras and succulents adds a touch of greenery and calmness to the space.\n\nMusic brings me so much joy, and this piano gets a lot of use at my place. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI like to lie on my couch and lose myself in classical music on my piano. Surrounded by blankets, sheepskin rugs, pillows, and stylish tray, it's the perfect way to recharge after a busy day. My bathroom is both luxurious and pragmatic\n\nMy bathroom is pretty spacious for a small space, and I found most of my essentials at Costco. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nIn my bathroom, the essentials that I can't do without: my gold hoop earrings, my two pairs of glasses and my contacts that I wear every single day. When I first moved out, I found all the bathroom basics I needed at Costco: towels, hand towels, a shower curtain, soap dispenser, and mats. When allergy season strikes, the tissue paper is a lifesaver, since they sell it in bulk. The real steal in my bathroom is the perfume that usually goes for $200 at other stores but is $69.99 at Costco. I've got two of them, and they've become my go-to scents. My bedroom is a haven My $250 bed frame paired with my $500 mattress are so comfortable. I have two sets of Kirkland Signature 680 Thread Count Sheet Set that I snagged when they went on sale. I love my down blanket and I have another favorite I got for $12.\n\nMe in my cozy bedroom. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nIn woven side baskets, I stash my Costco pajamas, keeping everything neat and organized. I also love my Shark Roomba, which cleans my apartment when I'm not here. An outdoor space with possibility The outdoor space isn't fully furnished yet. So far, my Costco paddle board is the centerpiece.\n\nI'm very excited to use my outdoor space and my paddle board this summer. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI moved during the winter, but now that summer is upon us, I hope to add more to the space soon. I've got my eye on some discounted outdoor patio sets.\n\nThe sweatshirt says it all. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It",

        "title": "How to avoid scams while job-hunting online, according to career experts",
        "body": "Landing a job has become more difficult, even while the labor market may look robust \u2014 and it's a situation that scammers are eager to exploit. It's a big enough issue that federal agencies like the FBI and Federal Trade Commission have issued warnings about job scams. One common scheme: Swindlers who pose as recruiters and contact you unprompted \u2014 including on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn or even through WhatsApp messages \u2014 to entice you with a job opportunity you didn't apply for. Then, they may ask you to send them money or personal information, according to Amanda Augustine, a career expert at TopResume. Or they might claim that you first need to complete their training course or coaching services to be eligible for their job opening in a predatory attempt to sell you their products, she says. While real recruiters do often reach out cold to potential hires, there's a key difference between them and the grifters: \"They're straightforward with you,\" says career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin. Here are ways to spot and protect yourself from a con while job-hunting.\n\nBe skeptical if the job looks too perfect\n\nIf a job posting \"seems too good to be true,\" it probably is, Augustine says. That includes openings promising to make you a lot of money fast. In those \"get-rich-quick\" instances, \"run for the hills,\" Augustine cautions. Be wary if a company is quick to offer you a position without going through the standard vetting procedure. A legitimate process should require at least one interview, even if it's only over the phone, she says. Still, an interview doesn't guarantee the role is above board. Scammers sometimes hold phony interviews using text chat and video messaging to obtain your personal information without blowing their cover, according to ZipRecruiter. Some duped job hunters have taken to social media to share their experiences with fake interviews. LinkedIn blocked more than 63 million fake accounts during the second half of 2023, according to its most recent community report. The platform also removed more than 108 million pieces of spam and scam content over the same period, per the report. The job site is \"committed to ensuring the platform remains authentic, secure, and easy to use for members,\" said Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn's vice president of trust product management, in a statement. Ultimately, if a recruiter reaches out to you for an unusually attractive job you haven't applied for, \"you need to be especially suspicious,\" Augustine says.\n\nQuestion vague or nonexistent job descriptions\n\nSometimes a disguised fraudster will insist they can't provide any details because a job posting is confidential. But generally, if a company can't produce a copy of the job description, that's a big red flag, Augustine says. Some companies make executive-level job openings confidential to high-profile applicants at first, but they will begin disclosing more details about the role as the interview process gets underway. \"If you are not at a director level or above and someone is approaching you for a confidential listing, it's probably a scam, because there isn't really much reason for a company to be cagey about hiring an individual contributor or a manager-level position,\" Gavin says. \"It's those senior-level positions that can have some PR consequences if it is known that they're doing a search.\" For job openings that have no reason being kept so tightly under wraps, a formal job description should be handed over upon request, Augustine explains. You should also watch out for job descriptions that are \"really vague\" and fail to offer enough information about the job title, location, key responsibilities and qualifications. A job description riddled with typos and errors can also indicate a scam. Because of new tools powered by artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that can fix grammatical issues in text, however, Augustine says this clue is becoming less prominent.\n\nCheck the company's online footprint\n\nYou should be able to locate a company's digital presence, Augustine says. That could be a LinkedIn profile, website or social media page. \"Even your mom-and-pop ice cream shop has a Facebook page these days,\" she says. \"If there's absolutely no digital trail about this company, or it's really, really sparse when you're running some Google searches, I would be concerned.\" Ask a prospective employer to direct you to their website \u2014 where you can also see if the job listing is posted \u2014 and double-check any links you receive to make sure they don't route to a phishing website, Gavin suggests. Exercise caution if a recruiter is not using a corporate email address, Augustine says. You may find third-party recruiters who use a Gmail account, but internal recruiters typically have a company email address, she notes. Also, watch out for communications from email addresses with misspellings or \"spoofed\" company names that are similar but slightly different from the actual business name, according to Indeed's guidelines for a safe job search. If you're still unsure whether a company is legitimate, Augustine suggests searching the company's name along with the word \"scam\" on Google. That search may turn up a history of dishonest activity if it's an illicit enterprise that has struck before.\n\n'Take your time' and don't get discouraged",

Dimitar Dilkoff | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFrench stocks staged a relief rally early Monday after results from the first round of the nation's snap election raised expectations of a hung parliament. The far-right National Rally party and its allies won 33.1% of the vote, the left-wing NFP alliance was second with 28% and Macron's coalition secured 20%, France's Interior Ministry said Monday. France's benchmark CAC 40 index was 1.3% higher by 10:17 a.m. London time, off earlier highs of more than 2.5%. \"The election, in the end, tells us pretty much what we knew before, which is that the most likely scenario remains a hung parliament,\" Sebastian Paris Horvitz, director of research at La Banque Postale Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\" From a market perspective that is the \"least bad\" option, he added, although it's far from ideal. \"Generally you have a majority to govern France ... After the second round, maybe we are not going to have such a majority. And so we have to figure out how France will be governed.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon CAC 40 index.\n\nIt comes after economists at Citi and elsewhere warned that an outright victory for either the far-right or leftist alliance could cause a severe market shock given their tax and spending plans, with the potential to spiral into a debt crisis. \"A hung parliament appears likely and would, we believe, be seen as a positive development for European assets, as markets would price in policies on tax and immigration that would more closely resemble the status quo,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in a note Monday. \"Following their strong showing in the first round, the possibility of a majority for National Rally remains in play, however, which could act to cap gains in the euro in the coming days.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Euro/U.S. dollar.\n\nThe second round of the vote is due on July 7 and to win a majority, the National Rally would need to secure 289 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament. Current candidates now have until Tuesday evening to confirm whether they will be proceeding to the final round. Some left-wing and centrist candidates who placed third in their local race are expected to drop out to avoiding splitting the vote, in an effort to curb far-right gains. This has added to uncertainty over the end result.\n\nwatch now\n\nA key question remains who will be prime minister \u2014 a position currently held by Gabriel Attal, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally is hoping it will be the party's 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella. With Macron previously stating he plans to carry out the remainder of his term as president until 2027, this would lead to a \"cohabitation\" scenario in which the two roles are at odds. Even in a hung parliament \u2014 where no party has an overall majority, making it difficult to pass bills and implement a broad agenda \u2014 the French Constitution allows for the continuation of the current budget, so areas such as pension payments are not destabilized, Horvitz said.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Still, there is no reform,\" he continued, noting this comes as a critical time for Europe as it deals with defense threats, the energy transition and weak French and German economic growth. Horvitz added that French borrowing costs, which have soared versus Germany's since the election was called, are likely to remain elevated. That will likely lead to continued pressure on assets linked to bonds, including bank stocks and some utilities, he said.\n\nLoading chart...",

        "body": "Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.\n\nBut the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.\n\n\"A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,\" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\n\n\"As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,\" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.\n\nThis trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.\n\nJones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.\n\nHe explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.\n\n\"Human beings do the same thing,\" Jones explained. \"Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.\"\n\nJones' recently published book \"Face Your Fears\" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.",

Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.\n\nThe DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes.

That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.

        "body": "An aerial view shows a Philippines Navy vessel that has been grounded since 1999 to assert the nation's sovereignty over the Second Thomas Shoal, a remote South China Sea reef also claimed by China. Jay Directo | Afp | Getty Images\n\nChina has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. \"The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,\" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the Philippines and U.S. released new \"Bilateral Defense Guidelines,\" reaffirming that an \"armed attack\" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing \"gray zone\" tactics \u2014 coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict \u2014 at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.\n\nU.S. 'gray zone' conundrum\n\nBeijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ \"gray zone\" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. \"The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,\" he said.\n\nGP: Philippine Coast Guard personnel ride a rubber boat past a Chinese Coast Guard vessel during a resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nAn expanded definition of an \"armed attack\" in the treaty could include \"any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,\" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,\" said Heydarian. \"It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,\" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.\n\nAmid a \"sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,\" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an \"armed attack,\" the country needs to \"do more\" than protest China's actions.\n\nA Chinese Coast Guard ship fires a water cannon at Unaizah May 4, a Philippine Navy chartered vessel, conducting a routine resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea.

There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,\" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. \"Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,\" he added.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "title": "CNBC's Inside India newsletter: The humble onion could be holding India's economy hostage",
        "body": "A seller is arranging onions at a vegetable market in Nagaon district, in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on February 1, 2024.\n\nThis report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nA curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.\n\nSo, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.\n\nAnd it has been for the past year.\n\nThe price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.\n\nPoor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.\n\nTemperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.\n\nFood prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.\n\n\"The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,\" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. \"Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,\" he added.\n\nKeeping rates elevated, though, appears to be \"an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,\" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.\n\nThe anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.\n\n\"Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,\" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.\n\nThe government also has the option to remove import taxes \u2014 currently set at 40% on wheat \u2014 to hold prices down.\n\nYet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.\n\nLowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.\n\nFor now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice.

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\" \"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \"disastrous\" prospect.\" \"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\" said Bose. \"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\" she added.\n\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\" Bose said. \"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \"event of death, resignation or disability\" that leaves the role vacant.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Iranian women cast their ballots at a polling station during elections to select members of parliament and a key clerical body, in Tehran on March 1, 2024. ATTA KENARE | AFP\n\nIran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash \u2014 and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners \u2014 and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years \u2014 and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.\n\nwatch now\n\nMost of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. \"In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,\" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. \"Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,\" they wrote. \"A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.\"\n\nWho is running?\n\nTwo candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.\n\nWhere the real power lies\n\nIran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks with media after casting his ballot during the Iranian Parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections at the Leadership office in Tehran, Iran, on March 1, 2024.

        "body": "In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

        "title": "France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means",
        "body": "Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from \"political paralysis\" to \"immediate financial crisis.\" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.\n\nA complex system\n\nUnder France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff \u2014 a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using \"le vote utile\" \u2014 or tactical voting \u2014 to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be \"civil war\" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger \u2014 and therefore more representative \u2014 than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.\n\nMarket turmoil\n\nSuch a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a \"worse reputation globally,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs \u2014 a key indicator of French political risk \u2014 has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Spendthrift agendas\" from either party \u2014 whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax \u2014 could result in an \"immediate financial crisis,\" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently \"too optimistic\" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. \"Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,\" the analysts noted.\n\nPolitical paralysis\n\nThe CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella \u2014 Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally \u2014 was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement \"reasonable\" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would \"need an absolute majority to govern,\" in a bid to boost his backing. \"You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,\" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.",

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

        "body": "A photo illustration of the Chewy logo is seen on a smartphone and a PC screen.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.\n\nChewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.\n\nThere's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\n\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\n\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the \"gamification\" of retail trading.",

It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.\n\n\"Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,\" the bank said.\n\nThe error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.\n\nThe news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.\n\nLast year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.\n\nBanks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.",

This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .\n\nWhile no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.\n\nThat is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.\n\n\"While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,\" Barr said. \"The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.\"\n\nThe Fed also performed what it called an \"exploratory analysis\" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.\n\nIn this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.\n\n\"The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,\" the Fed said.\n\nBanks are expected to begin announcing their latest share repurchase plans on Friday.",

        "body": "In this article MS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSignage is displayed outside Morgan Stanley & Co. headquarters in the Times Square neighborhood of New York. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\" McMillan told CNBC. \"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\"\n\nConsent required\n\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\n\n\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \"grand experiment in productivity,\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\" with clients, said McMillan. \"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\"\n\nThe broader vision",

Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.\n\nThe good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.\n\nThe bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.\n\nThe takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.\n\nHigher returns, participation rates, savings rates\n\nWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.\n\nFirst, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.\n\nBut to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.\n\nOn those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"\n\nPlan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.\n\nThe result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.\n\nParticipant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.\n\nA few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:\n\nThey prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.\n\nThey don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. \"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.\n\nDespite gains in the market, account balances are still low\n\nIn 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.\n\nWhy such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.\n\nDistribution of account balances\n\nLess than $20,000 40%\n\n$20,000-$99,999 30%\n\n$100,000-$249,900 15%\n\n$250,000 + 15%\n\nSource: Vanguard\n\nMedian balances for those near retirement are still low\n\nA different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.\n\nInvestors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.\n\nA median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.\n\nOf course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.\n\nRegardless, the math does not look great\n\nSo let's do some retirement math.\n\nA typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.\n\nNext, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.\n\nFinally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.\n\nAccording to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).\n\nHere's our yearly retirement budget:\n\nPersonal savings $3,539\n\nPension $9,262\n\nSocial Security $20,264\n\nTotal: $33,065\n\nIt's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.\n\nEven then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.\n\nAnd these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.\n\nAnd that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.\n\nIn 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTo have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.\n\nOne issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.\n\nHowever, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.\n\nRegardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.",

        "body": "Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator. Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\n\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"",

Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters\n\nDALIAN, China \u2014 For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more \"applications\" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan \u2014 also known as the \"renminbi\" or \"RMB\" \u2014 in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's \"Summer Davos\" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. \"We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,\" she said. \"You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc.\" \"One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,\" Chan said, \"so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the HKEX announced a \"Dual-Counter\" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, \"we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,\" Hu said. \"Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.\"\n\nA maturing financial market\n\nDeveloping more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term \"patient investing.\" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. \"Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,\" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.\n\nWaiting for more Chinese IPOs",

Overall, the share of households with life insurance has \"steadily\" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. \"It's a complex transaction,\" he said.\n\nThere are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, \"I do think there's a need for it,\" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.\n\nWhen to buy life insurance\n\nSupersizer | E+ | Getty Images\n\nConsumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. \"Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?\" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.\n\nWhat type of life insurance to buy\n\nThere are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.\n\nIt's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG\n\nIf a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires \u2014 perhaps at age 65 \u2014 the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.\n\nHow much life insurance to get\n\nLuca Sage | Digitalvision | Getty Images",

        "body": "In this article F\n\nGM\n\nSTLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nGM launched 'EV Live,' a free online platform that connects electric vehicle owners or consumers who have questions about zero-emissions cars and trucks with an expert who can answer them. Courtesy: GM\n\nDETROIT \u2014 Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of \"electrified\" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. \"More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are.\" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with \"electrified\" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. \"I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,\" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. \"The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.\"\n\nEV naming\n\nWhile consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles \"electrified,\" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular \"hybrid,\" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as \"hybrid EVs.\" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. \"Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,\" Waatti said.\n\nGM's 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV (right) next to a gas-powered Chevy Equinox on May 16, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\n\nSome automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the \"Wagoneer\" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer \"S\" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. \"I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,\" he said during a recent interview. \"It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.\"\n\nEducation is key\n\nOne thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. \"We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,\" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. \"We're trying our best to educate them.\"\n\n2024 Jeep Wagoneer S EV Jeep\n\nKia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched \"EV Live\" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as \"GM Energy Live,\" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. \"Each customer, in the end, is very different,\" said J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. \"I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,\" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.\n\nAutomotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and \"propulsion\" options than ever before.

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023.

But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

        "body": "An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.\n\nFord Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\nFarley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford \"skunkworks\" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .\n\nFarley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are \"never going to make money.\"\n\n\"You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,\" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. \"That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. \u2026 The batteries will never be affordable.\"\n\nA Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.\n\nFord earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed \"T3,\" from late 2025 to 2026.\n\nFarley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.\n\nHe also said Americans need to \"get back in love\" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.\n\n\"We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,\" Farley said Friday. \"We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.\"\n\nFord's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.\n\nFarley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.\n\n\"If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,\" he said. \"And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.\"",

        "body": "Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.\n\nTractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.\n\nThe retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.\n\nTractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.\n\nTractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.\n\n\"Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,\" Tractor Supply said in the news release. \"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.\"\n\nTractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.\n\nThe retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.\n\nThe changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.\n\nCompanies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.",

        "title": "Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness",
        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

        "body": "Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.\n\nThe pool began leaking air after just a few uses.\n\nFor Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool \u2014 and the disappointment that came with it \u2014 helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.\n\nAs Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.\n\nSam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.\n\n\"The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,\" he said in an interview. \"Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.\"\n\nThe success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.\n\nOvertaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"Never say never,\" he said. \"Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.\"\n\nBut he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.\n\nThe popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.",

        "body": "The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .\n\nThough the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Power.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.\n\nPreviously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.\n\nThe study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.\n\nAcross the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.\n\nOverall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.\n\n\"Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.\n\nThe study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.\n\nBEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.\n\nTop concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.\n\n\"It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\" Hanley said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

        "body": "In this article RIVN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\n2025 Rivian R1S Rivian\n\nA Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\n\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \"high teens.\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \"R2\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\n\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\"'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\" but \"that is not the case,\" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \"the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\"\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\" Wentworth said. \"What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.\"\n\nHere's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\n63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter.

Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.\n\nAlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. \"China is the industry's new disruptor \u2013 capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,\" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .\n\nModels presenting the Chinese automaker's electric car, the BYD Song MAX, at the 45th Bangkok International Motor Show 2024 in Nonthaburi Province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, on March 30, 2024.

        "body": "A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024. Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters\n\nNASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called \"U.S. Deorbit Vehicle.\" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. \"It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,\" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to \"ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.\"\n\nSpaceX's Dragon crew capsule \"Endeavour\" seen from the International Space Station on May 2, 2024. NASA\n\nNASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. \u2013 along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan \u2013 has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.\n\nAging ISS\n\nBut the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. \"The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,\" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.",

        "title": "Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze",
        "body": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .\n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.\n\nLevi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\n\n16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.\n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.\n\n\"People are generally cautious,\" Singh told CNBC in an interview. \"It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\"\n\nWhile Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.\n\nLevi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.\n\n\"In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\" the company said.\n\nThe change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\"Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \"conservative\" view of the channel's growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.\n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.\n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.\n\nFor a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.\n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \"corrected\" that.\n\nRead the full earnings release here.",

        "body": "In this article GOOGL\n\nNFLX\n\nWBD\n\nDIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May \u2014 the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly \"The Gauge\" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. \"We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,\" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. \"Every [media] executive has to be paying attention.\" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV \u2014 an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others \u2014 even at times the same executives \u2014 view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube \"every day\" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. \"I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,\" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. \"When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,\" she said.\n\nYouTube's growing dominance\n\nGoogle's Tara Walpert Levy, now YouTube's vice president of Americas, speaks during a 2016 Advertising Week New York event, Sept. 28, 2016. John Lamparski | Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company \u2014 more than Disney and Comcast combined. \"YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,\" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.\n\nDisney's YouTube focus\n\nDisney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's \"The Gauge\" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.\n\nYou're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\" Brittany Broski YouTube creator\n\n\"I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,\" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as \"Bluey,\" \"Spidey and his Amazing Friends\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\"\n\nCartoon characters from the children's show \"Bluey\" are displayed during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 4, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\n\"At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,\" said Mayer. \"We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have.\" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series \"Disney Junior's Ariel,\" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of \"Winnie the Pooh\" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on \"Winnie the Pooh\" based on the short-form video data, the person said.\n\nNetflix's muted response\n\nNetflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. \"We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,\" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. \"Cocomelon,\" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. \"Cocomelon\" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and \"many more if you add in all languages,\" Mayer said. At the same time, \"Cocomelon\" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.\n\nPosters showing \"Blippi\" and \"Cocomelon\" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images\n\nThe more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.\n\nOther strategies\n\nComcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, scenes from \"The Office\" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a \"YouTube 1.0 strategy\" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. \"I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,\" said Nathanson. \"The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0.\" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack \u2014 pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, \"Beast Games,\" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a \"fast-paced and high-production format,\" as Amazon has promised.\n\nMrBeast accepts the Favorite Male Creator award onstage during the 2023 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, March 4, 2023. Monica Schipper | Getty Images\n\nMrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.\n\nYouTube's community\n\nThe popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. \"I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,\" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. \"You're betraying your audience,\" said Broski. \"You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\"\n\nBrittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nThe business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. \"Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?\" Broski said. \"You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?\" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. \"In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,\" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. \"With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.\"\n\nMichelle Khare at The 2023 Streamy Awards in Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2023.

        "body": "In this article MANU Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Boeing 767 passenger aircraft of Delta Air Lines arrives from Dublin at JFK International Airport in New York as the Manhattan skyline looms in the background on Feb. 7, 2024. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty Images\n\nDelta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines \u2014 second to Delta in net profit margins \u2014 is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. \"Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,\" Bastian told CNBC.\n\nEd Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2022. Bastian said that he sees 'strong demand' for flights carrying into 2023. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDelta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. \"The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,\" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. \"We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. \"If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for.\" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead \u2014 if not drive \u2014 shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is \"part art\" and \"part science,\" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. \"Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,\" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards FactSet\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. \"They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,\" he said. \"And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nWhen the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. \"It was about building the operation brick by brick,\" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. \"It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand.\" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. \"One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,\" said Anderson. \"If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home.\" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. \"They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,\" he said. \"They have time to serve rather than to apologize.\" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.\n\nTime to remodel\n\nAfter Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. \"You had the liberty to start investing in premium,\" he said. \"You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers.\" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. \"I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,\" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. \"I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things.\" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.\n\nwatch now\n\nDelta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (\"It's proprietary,\" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, \"I must be in some third-world country.\" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a \"juniority benefit.\" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.\n\nLuxury air travel? In the U.S.?\n\nLuxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years \u2014 and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. \"Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,\" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year \u2014 which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate \u2014 after an uproar from customers.\n\n'We're constantly pushing each other\"\n\nBoth Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. \"Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.\n\nHere's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected\n\n: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected\n\nThe company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.\n\nFedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.\n\n\"We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,\" Carere said. \"We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.\"\n\nThe capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nFollowing weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.\n\n\"DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.\n\nSubramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.\n\nAs part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.\n\nThe newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.\n\nFedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.\n\nInvestor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.\n\nSubramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a \"top priority\" for the company.\n\nWhile the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.\n\nUPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.",

        "body": "In this article LEVI Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Levi's store at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets in Florida. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Levi Strauss, year to date",

        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.\n\n\"Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,\" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. \"However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.\"\n\nThose comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.\n\nRecent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only \"modest further progress.\"\n\nBowman noted that there are \"a number of upside risks\" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.\n\n\"I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\" she said. \"Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nWhile that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% \"for some time.\"\n\nMoreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said \"it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.\"\n\nIn other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.\n\n\"With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,\" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nWhile Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.\n\nBoth officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.\n\n\"I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. \"We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.\"\n\nAlso, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees \"more months\" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.\n\nAs governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's\n\n\"dot plot\" grid of rate expectations as well as the Summary of Economic Projections.",

        "body": "Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.\n\nActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.\n\nRapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.\n\nDespite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space \u2013 it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.\n\nWith a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.\n\nGiven industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",

        "body": "Israel, Other Allies Concerned about US Projection of Weakness from Biden Debate Performance\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 After President Joe Biden's shocking debate performance Thursday, Israelis are alarmed, as are many other allies. They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.\n\nIf America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?\n\nAs columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, \u201cIn a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president \u2013 the leader of the free world \u2013 appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.\u201d\n\nIsraeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, , \"Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.\"\n\nSenator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, \"It's what foreign leaders \u2013 our enemies \u2013 saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'\"\n\nBiden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.\n\nGallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is \"preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.\"\n\nHe added, \"The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.\"\n\nBut as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, \u201cThis is what is most disturbing to me, is that we\u2019re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.\u201d\n\n'Hamas is the Only Obstacle'\n\nNoa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.\n\nIn a video, she implored, \"We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.\n\nAs he put it, \u201cAnd today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.\"\n\nHamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza.\n\n\"Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,\" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.\n\nNetanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.\n\n\"Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,\" Netanyahu stated. \"It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign \u2014 and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.\n\n\u201cAnthem of Grace\u201d kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see what God is doing,\u201d Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. \u201cAnd I think we all know this, but \u2026 there\u2019s a revival spreading. There\u2019s joy, there\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\nThe evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d the \u201cmost sung and most translated hymn ever.\u201d Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.\n\n\u201c[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God\u2019s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,\u201d Hall said.\n\nThe faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people\u2019s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see the hunger, and we\u2019re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God\u2019s changed them.\u201d\n\nHall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. \u2026 I\u2019ve got three kids, I\u2019m in a ministry now 20 plus years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I\u2019m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the year, Hall said he hopes \u201cAnthem of Grace\u201d helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.\n\n\u201cIn my heart and talking to so many believers \u2026 I just believe Jesus is coming soon \u2026 I just go to, you know, \u2018How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'\u201d\n\nHall continued, \u201cBecause we know that \u2026 the Word promises things, right? The Word\u2019s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.\u201d\n\nThe preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be \u201cwars, and rumors and wars\u201d and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s a quickening around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.\u201d\n\nHall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to \u201ctestify to the goodness of God\u201d \u2014 something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt would change the world overnight \u2026 just the testimony of the saints,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEven in Revelation, it says, \u2018We\u2019re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'\u201d\n\nThus, he hopes people\u2019s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel\u2019s power and sway to a watching world.",

        "body": "Five converts to Christianity have been sentenced by the Iranian judiciary to a collective of more than 25 years in prison, according to a report from Iran International.\n\nHengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nHamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nIn a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, \u201cThe growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God\u2019s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,\u201d he added.\n\nThe report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are \u201cacknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations\u2019 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, \u201cEveryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including \u201cmembership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security\u201d and \u201cpropaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.\u201d\n\nOpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,\u201d the organization explained in part. \u201cThe government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.\u201d\n\nPlease be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.",

        "body": "HYDERABAD, India \u2013 Calvary Temple is India's largest church with more than 300,000 members. Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.\n\nMost roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.\n\nAs church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.\n\nBy sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.\n\nThe main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.\n\nHundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.\n\nPastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.\n\n\"I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,\" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.\n\nCalvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nThey have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.\n\n\"God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,\" said Kumar.\n\nPastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.\n\n\"God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.\n\n\"It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,\" said Kumar.\n\nMillions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?\n\n\"Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,\" said Kumar.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.**\n\nThat practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.\n\nNarayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring \u2013 all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.\n\n\"We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,\" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.\n\nNagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.\n\n\"Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,\" Mendem said. \"God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.\"\n\nShe and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.\n\n\"In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,\" Kumar said. \"We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.\"\n\nCalvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.\n\n\"The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,\" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.\n\nMembers also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements \u2013 again, all for free.\n\nIn 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.\n\n\"I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,\" Kumar said.\n\nEach member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.\n\n\"Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,\" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. \"They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.\"\n\nPastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.\n\n\"During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,\" Kumar told CBN News. \"Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.\"\n\nEach month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a \"Night with God\" as members pray for revival.\n\n\"About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.\n\n\"The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,\" Kumar said.\n\nMost attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.\n\nPastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.\n\n\"No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,\" said Kumar. \"It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Comedian and famed political commentator Bill Maher predicted recently it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d former President Donald Trump will win the November election.\n\nHe went on to condemn the modern political left as \u201caggressively anti-common sense\u201d during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.\n\n\u201cPart of it the left has to own,\u201d he told Brown. \u201cThey are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It\u2019s OK to have penises in the women\u2019s swimming pool, in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m old; it\u2019s that your ideas are stupid.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\nMaher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to those people, you\u2019re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time \u2014 and they are \u2014 and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should keep the dialogue open,\u201d the HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host added.\n\nMaher recently appeared on the ABC talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.\n\n\u201cIf I had any doubt that I was right about the change that\u2019s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas \u2014 that straightened me out pretty quick,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to me that they can\u2019t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.\n\nIn what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.\n\nIn the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.\n\nThe Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'\n\n\n\nIn a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.\n\nThe original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.\n\nCritics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.\"\n\nTyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, \"This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state\u2014and the deep state\u2014accountable.\"\n\nThe Capitol Riot and Obstruction\n\nIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

        "body": "A last-minute peace deal could still possibly avert a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.\n\nBy the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.\n\nThat's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, \"Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.\"\n\nHezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.\n\n'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'\n\nAs the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.\n\nHe's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, \"On the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\nVisiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, \"The situation spirals out of control.\"\n\nExuberant Defiance of Terrorism\n\nEven as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.\n\nNimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.\n\nHe told the concert crowd, \u201cOn that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn\u2019t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.\"\n\nThe Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.\n\n'We Will Dance Again!'\n\nBut the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.\n\nAs concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, \"Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.\u201d\n\nNimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, \"In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\nREAD ISIS Network Helped 400 Cross US Border Illegally - Many of Them Are Now Missing\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "body": "ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming Fast\n\nThe hijab \u2014 the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women \u2014 is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.\n\nFor many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.\n\nChange is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.\n\nIt's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.\n\nThe raw emotion of the protests \u2014 including images of women publicly burning their hijabs \u2014 has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.\n\nExplosive Yearning\n\nThe protests, known as the \"Women, Life, Freedom Movement\", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.\n\nAnd the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.\n\nThe protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its \"morality police\" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.\n\nThis movement continues to gather momentum.\n\nIncreasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nThe change is not only social. It's religious, too.\n\nChristians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith \u2014 and those are just ones we know about.\n\nBut most Iranians don't see Christians as \"the enemy\" anymore.\n\nA generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.\n\nYet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.\n\nIllegal house churches \u2014 believers secretly meeting in homes \u2014 are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.\n\nA New Revolution\n\nBut new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's \"isolated\" believers.\n\nThey're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as T\u00fcrkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.\n\nThere's more to this new media revolution.\n\nSAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.\n\nSocial media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.\n\nA boy named Kaamran told us: \"The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.\"\n\nChange is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.\n\nIn fact, it's already here.\n\n--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and \"digital church\" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.",

        "body": "An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.\n\nThe official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.\n\nThe decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, \"This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.\"\n\nWATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban\n\nWhat the Case Is Really About\n\nThe Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.\n\nIdaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's \"health\" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.\n\nAnd the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent \"a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.\"\n\nDuring the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.\n\n\"One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,\" he said, \"is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'\"\n\nAlito pointed out, \"So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAbortion Leaks at the Supreme Court\n\nTwo years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\nThe Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.\n\n\n\nPro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, \"With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.\"",

        "body": "Human rights groups say 36,000 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the last two decades, including Mrs. Son, a former official of the North Korean military. During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.\n\n\n\nShe told CBN News, \"My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.\"\n\n\n\nIn order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.\n\n\n\n\"We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,\" Mrs. Son said.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.\n\n\"My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.\n\n\n\n\"Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.\"\n\n\n\nAfter yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.\n\n\n\n\"The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released\u2026 malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,\" Mrs. Son recounted.\n\n\n\nOnce in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.\n\nThe name of the church, \"Seopyoung\" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.\n\n\n\nRev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, \"It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.\"\n\n\"During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,\" he reports. \"Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.\"\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.\n\n\n\n\"I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,\" Mrs. Son said.",

        "body": "\u201cOnly God can do that.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband \u2014 who used to identify as homosexual \u2014 came to faith in Jesus.\n\nNic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple \u2014 husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire\u2019s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.\n\nKnowles, a Catholic, described the couple\u2019s testimony as \u201cone of the wildest stories I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nIn addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,\u201d said Nic of their experience together. \u201cBut nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe world can tell you so much about who you\u2019re \u2018supposed to be\u2019 based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might \u2026 make you feel included for a time.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the \u201clie\u201d of the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe whole world in the queer community was saying, \u2018Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'\u201d she recalled hearing. \u201c[But] that argument doesn\u2019t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, \u2018God made me this way,\u2019 then that means that I should have been a woman.\u201d\n\nLex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging \u2014 something she had not previously found in her family or faith.\n\nShe grew up in an abusive household \u2014 one that claimed to be \u201cChristian\u201d \u2014 with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, \u201cIf I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,\u201d a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.\n\nEvery time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would \u201creject me.\u201d Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.\n\n\u201cI ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to walk with you through this journey.\u2019 But all I faced was rejection.\u201d\n\nNic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, \u201cnever tried to change me,\u201d even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God\u2019s design for males and females.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.\u201d\n\nInitially, as a transgender male \u2014 meaning biologically female \u2014 and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.\n\nThey currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.\n\nThe couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn\u2019t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.\n\n\u201cThey chose to love us,\u201d Lex said of the church they attended. \u201cAnd that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.\u201d\n\nIn March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,\u201d Lex wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cHe is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, \u2018I do,\u2019 after Pastor Ivan said, \u2018Do you take her to be your bride.\u2019 Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic\u2019s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The debate over surgeries for gender-confused minors is one of the most heated arguments of our time. Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.\n\n\"Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,\" The Times reports.\n\nThe administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.\n\nMore than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.\n\nLATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children\n\nCritics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.\n\nBut as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that \"children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.\"\n\nMORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'\n\nWhen we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, \"The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nMeanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed \"weak evidence\" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.\n\n\"This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,\" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. \"In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.\"\n\nThere is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.\n\nNew rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.\n\nPerformance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.\n\n\"Which Joe Biden's going to show up?\" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. \"My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.\"\n\nNathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. \"Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,\" Gonzales explained. \"Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.\"\n\nBiden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions\u2014a first for a presidential candidate\u2014and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.\n\nPresident Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days.

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 There are media reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be about to abandon his opposition to a Palestinian state next to Israel. That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.\n\nAides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.\n\nYet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu \"opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.\"\n\nThe prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.\n\nItamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.\n\n\"There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,\" Marcus stated. \"There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th \u2013 and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres \u2013 and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.\"\n\nPreparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays\n\nOn another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.\n\nIn Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.\n\nGallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. \"The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,\" the defense minister said.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. \"We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,\" Fetterman declared.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, \"It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.\"\n\nAntisemitism in NYC\n\nIn New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, \"Raise your hands if you're a Zionist \u2013 this is your chance to get out!\"\n\nEarlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.\n\nOne protester said of Bragg, \"He's either a coward or an antisemite.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Better Medicine than Pills and Surgery, Doctor Says\n\nAmericans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.\n\nAfter watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.\n\n\"She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,\" Dr. Means told CBN News.\n\nDitching Mainstream Medicine\n\nAfter becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.\n\n\"What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.\n\n\"This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nShe explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.\n\nDiet Matters Most\n\nDr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take \"an ultra-aggressive stance on diet\" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.\n\n\"The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,\" Dr. Means said. \"Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.\"\n\nAfter nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nAvoid Processed Foods\n\nDr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,\" she said. \"Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.\"\n\nShe advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The true story of Jose Hernandez is out-of-this-world.\n\nAs a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.\n\nNow, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called \"A Million Miles Away.\"\n\nHernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.\n\n\"The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,\" he said.\n\n\"When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,\" he continued.\n\nHernandez described his personal path to perseverance.\n\n\"I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,\" he told CBN News.\n\nFaith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,\" he told CBN News.\n\nMany are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.\n\n\"It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,\" he said.\n\nAs a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.\n\n\"My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,\" he continued.\n\nAs Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.\n\n\"A Million Miles Away\" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.\n\n",

        "body": "Reports of stunning mass baptisms are coming out of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where one Christian leader revealed that more than 300,000 people have been baptized this year into the Christian faith.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.\n\nThe outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.\n\nThe effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.\n\nWilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.\n\n\u201cThe latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in \u2018PNG for Christ\u2019 with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.\u201d\n\nHe followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.\n\nWilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the \u201cHoly Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nJust days before Wilson\u2019s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.\n\nWith so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people \u2014 an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers\u2019 desire to express their faith.\n\nThe impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of \u201cdrug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.\u201d\n\nPNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.\n\n\u201cIt is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,\u201d he told the Adventist Record. \u201cI would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nBe sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.\n\nCBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Five years after Hurricane Michael ravaged Florida's Panhandle, Lighthouse Church in Panama City stands as a testament to perseverance. Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.\n\n\n\nScars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.\n\n\n\n\"When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you \u2013 but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,\" said Pastor Bailey.\n\n\n\nThe first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.\n\n\n\nAfter 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.\n\nPastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.\n\n\n\n\"I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'\" Pastor Bailey recounted. \"And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.\"\n\n\n\nVolunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.\n\n\"They came in with resources that blew our minds,\" said Bailey. \"They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.\"\n\nStephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.\n\n\"I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,\" said Robinson. \"But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.\"\n\nDespite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.\n\n\"And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,\" said Robinson.\n\nPastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.\n\n\"But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,\" said Pastor Bailey. \"I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.\n\nThe Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.\n\n\"We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,\" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.\n\nScala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.\n\n\"For academics, we look at it based purely on data,\" Scala explained. \"So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.\n\n\"We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,\" Scala said.\n\nIn the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.\n\n\"We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,\" Scala said.\n\nThis is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "One evangelist\u2019s request of former President Donald Trump is seemingly a bit too much of an ask for the reality TV star turned politician.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee told a crowd gathered in Philadelphia Saturday he is denying the Rev. Franklin Graham\u2019s suggestion he avoid using course language during his speeches, essentially because it makes his addresses less interesting.\n\nIn a clip shared on X, Trump praised Graham as a \u201cman I like\u201d and described him as someone he admires before recalling a letter the evangelist \u2014 the son of the late Billy Graham \u2014 wrote, in which he asked the brash politician to stop using \u201cfoul language\u201d on his campaign stops.\n\nAt a rally in Philadelphia, Trump tells crowd that Franklin Graham wrote him a letter telling him his speeches would be better if he didn\u2019t use \u201cfoul language.\u201d Trump says Graham is \u201cwrong!\u201d @Franklin_Graham #trump pic.twitter.com/1zfMKpL9a3 \u2014 Jesse Jackson (@JesseTJackson) June 23, 2024\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn\u2019t use foul language,'\u201d Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump claimed he has been working \u201cso hard\u201d to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues \u2014 which often run between one and two hours \u2014 make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.\n\nHe requested Graham allow him \u201cone or two\u201d curse words, because \u201cif you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t get the emphasis.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nTo show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump said, \u201cI was really good. I didn\u2019t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.\u201d\n\nThe likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: \u201cWhen I see people start to walk out, then we\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to use the word bull****,\u201d Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad a word.\u201d\n\nAs for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.\n\nIn 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver \u2014 a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\u201cThese ten, from [Trump\u2019s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,\u201d Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cIt makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.\u201d\n\nNews of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThere are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,\u201d he said in a statement shared with CBN News. \u201cWe know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out \u2014 whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.\n\n\"Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,\" Austin said Tuesday. \"And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.\"\n\nStill, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,\" Austin stated.\n\nYoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.\n\n\"The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,\" Gallant insisted.\n\nIn Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.\n\nFormer Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. \"And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,\" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. \"The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy \u2013 and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,\" Lipman said.\n\nAnd in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive \u201cSquad\u201d lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman\u2019s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",
        "summary": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today.\nMeanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.\nStill, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East.\nIn Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military.",

        "title": "Gen Zers are so disillusioned with the economy that they think it\u2019s OK to commit fraud",
        "body": "Each quarter, my company Sift produces an index report to better understand the latest online fraud trends, including how businesses and consumers are affected, emerging fraud tactics, and how fraud impacts consumer behavior when making purchases online. For the past two quarters, we\u2019ve seen a surprising generational divide emerge: Gen Z\u2014 born between 1997 and 2012\u2014expresses more willingness than any other generation to commit digital fraud.\n\nIn Q4 2023, 42% of Gen Zers admitted a willingness to engage in first-party fraud, where they dispute a purchase with their payment provider despite the purchase being legitimate. This was significantly higher than any other generation\u2014the next highest was millennials, with only 22% admitting to engaging in first-party fraud. This quarter, we discovered that 33% of Gen Z respondents either know someone who has participated in payment fraud or have done so themselves. Again, these rates are much higher than other generations.\n\nThis data might seem sensational, but if we explore it more deeply, it\u2019s very telling. Academics have a theory called the \u201cfraud triangle,\u201d which argues that people are more inclined to commit fraud if they have incentive, rationalization, and opportunity.\n\nGen Z is facing persistent and diverse financial challenges\n\nGen Z has a number of unfortunate economic factors to feel anxious about. A survey from Intuit found that 73% of Zoomers feel that the current economic environment has made it more challenging to save money. They\u2019re struggling with increased housing costs, student loan debt, and rising prices on everyday purchases like groceries, all while wages have stagnated for workers across many income levels.\n\nThese factors snowball into a financially stressful situation that makes it more challenging to afford day-to-day necessities. Unsurprisingly, more economic anxiety can inspire people to look for tactics to stretch every dollar. For most, this behavior is innocuous: clipping coupons, switching from name-brand to generic items, or shopping secondhand. In fact, Gen Z is also the most likely to shop for secondhand items online, with 42% of this generation purchasing a resale item in the past year.\n\nBut facing the wrong set of circumstances, some people will turn to stolen payment methods or chargebacks to get more with less. In these situations, consumers may rationalize fraudulent behavior by convincing themselves that their actions are necessary or justified given the economic environment. They may view their actions as a temporary solution, or even as a moral gray area with few consequences to anyone.\n\nThey approach brand loyalty differently\n\nGen Z may see large corporations as a cause for these broader economic challenges, making them less likely to view stealing from them as immoral. They may see this behavior as a victimless crime, as the companies they are transacting with are often industry behemoths.\n\nThey also have less loyalty to legacy brands compared to earlier generations. Name recognition alone is not enough to compel Gen Zers to make a purchase. Increasingly, they are looking for \u201cdupes\u201d as a way to save money, prioritizing cheaper goods and services over premium brands. This spans all types of purchases, from clothing and accessories to beauty and personal care products. They\u2019re also more willing to try new brands and are less swayed by established names and celebrity endorsements.\n\nThis mentality extends beyond the businesses they buy from. Gen Zers also prioritize spending flexibility and are more drawn to monthly subscriptions or sharing services that allow access without the commitment of ownership, from car-sharing to video streaming to product subscriptions.\n\nWith that desire for unlimited access to goods and services, comes a natural drive to maintain that access, which could make shoppers more inclined to turn to nefarious means to do so. The logic is that a company will most likely notice if you\u2019re stealing a car or TV\u2014but the risk is far less likely with a $6.99 monthly subscription.\n\nThey\u2019re digitally native\n\nGen Z is more heavily influenced by social media and spends more time online than any other generation, allowing online trends to dictate what they buy and how they get their news.\n\nTheir time on social media also exposes them to more fraud. Harkening back to iconic online grifters like Anna Delvey and Fyre Fest, there\u2019s a newer category of influencers that\u2019s promoting more outright fraud, selling step-by-step guides that detail how to hack into accounts or make purchases with stolen payment methods. Sift data finds that 34% of Gen Zers have seen offers to take part in online fraud, compared to only 9% of baby boomers. That exposure to social media content is another key reason why Gen Z is more likely to commit fraud\u2014and highlights the deep influence of social media on consumer behaviors.\n\nThis generation\u2019s unique challenges and perspectives create the need for a nuanced approach from businesses, one that addresses their economic anxieties, adapts to their consumer habits, and engages with them where they are online.\n\nSome proven approaches include:\n\nEmphasizing authenticity and social responsibility. This helps consumers feel a deeper emotional connection to a brand and prevents them from treating it like a faceless entity.\n\nThis helps consumers feel a deeper emotional connection to a brand and prevents them from treating it like a faceless entity. Providing discounts and flexible payment options like BNPL (buy now, pay later), so consumers can simultaneously save and splurge.\n\nlike BNPL (buy now, pay later), so consumers can simultaneously save and splurge. Promoting flexibility , through offerings like monthly, low-cost subscriptions.\n\n, through offerings like monthly, low-cost subscriptions. Offering clear return policies to minimize returns fraud and give shoppers more peace of mind.\n\nto minimize returns fraud and give shoppers more peace of mind. Prioritizing responsive customer service and offering refunds or alternatives promptly so shoppers don\u2019t turn to chargebacks to address any issues.\n\nThe willingness of Gen Z to engage in online fraud is a reflection of the complex interplay of economic pressures, changing consumer behaviors, and the influence of social media. This trend, while having a real business impact, stems from a place of financial stress, a desire for affordability, and a distinct approach to brand loyalty and consumption.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to view these findings and recommendations not as an indictment of a generation but as a window into a group that is increasing its purchasing power, even as it faces more economic hurdles.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

        "title": "California makes Visa, Mastercard to provide codes for gun sales",
        "body": "Beginning Monday, a California law will require credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard to provide banks with special retail codes that can be assigned to gun stores in order to track their sales.\n\nBut new laws will do the exact opposite in Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee and Wyoming by banning the use of specific gun shop codes.\n\nThe conflicting laws highlight what has quietly emerged as one of the nation\u2019s newest gun policy debates, dividing state capitols along familiar partisan lines.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers and gun-control activists hope the new retail tracking code will help financial institutions flag suspicious gun-related purchases for law enforcement agencies, potentially averting mass shootings and other crimes. Lawmakers in Colorado and New York have followed California\u2019s lead.\n\n\u201cThe merchant category code is the first step in the banking system saying, `Enough! We\u2019re putting our foot down,\u2019\u201d said Hudson Munoz, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Guns Down America. \u201c`You cannot use our system to facilitate gun crimes.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut many Republican lawmakers and gun-rights advocates fear the retail code could lead to unwarranted suspicion of gun buyers who have done nothing wrong. Over the past 16 months, 17 states with GOP-led legislatures have passed measures prohibiting a firearms store code or limiting its use.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a first step by gun-control supporters to restrict the lawful commerce in firearms,\u201d said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group that backs laws blocking use of the tracking code.\n\nThe new laws add to the wide national divide on gun policy. This past week, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis, citing a rising number of firearm-related deaths, including more than 48,000 in 2022. The move was quickly criticized by the National Rifle Association.\n\nStates have dug opposing trench lines on other gun policies. On July 4, for example, Republican-led Louisiana will become the 29th state to allow residents to carry concealed guns without a permit.\n\nBy contrast, Democratic-led New Mexico this year tightened laws for people who don\u2019t have concealed-carry permits, requiring a seven-day waiting period for gun purchases, which is more than double the three-day period for a federal background check.\n\nStates also have responded differently to recent mass shootings. In Maine, where an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others, the Democratic-led Legislature passed a variety of new gun restrictions. Following school shootings in Iowa and Tennessee, the Republican-led legislatures there took steps that could allow more trained teachers to bring guns into classrooms.\n\nThe surge of legislation targeting firearm store category codes addresses a behind-the-scenes aspect of electronic financial transactions. The International Organization for Standardization, based in Geneva, sets thousands of voluntary standards for various fields, including category codes for all kinds of businesses, from bakeries to boat dealers to bookstores.\n\nThose category lists are distributed by credit card networks to banks, which assign particular codes to businesses whose accounts they handle. Some credit card issuers use the category codes for customer reward points.\n\nThe codes can be used by financial institutions to help identify fraud, money laundering or unusual purchasing patterns that are reported as suspicious activities to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n\nBanks and other depository institutions filed more than 1.8 million confidential reports in 2022 flagging more than 5.1 million suspicious activities. About 4% of annual reports lead to follow-up by law enforcement and an even smaller percentage to prosecution, according to the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing large banks.\n\nStores that sell guns have previously been grouped with other retailers in merchant category codes. Some have been classified as sporting goods stores, others as miscellaneous and specialty retail shops.\n\nAt the urging of New York-based Amalgamated Bank, which worked with gun-control groups, the International Organization for Standardization adopted a new four-digit category code for gun and ammunition shops in 2022. Major credit card networks initially said they would implement it but backed off under pressure from conservative politicians and the gun industry.\n\nMunoz, who helped lead the effort to establish the firearms store code, noted credit cards were used to buy weapons and ammunition for some of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings.\n\nThe intent of a gun merchant code is to spot suspicious patterns, like a person with little history of gun purchases who suddenly spends large amounts at multiple gun stores in a short period. Once alerted by banks, authorities could investigate, potentially thwarting a mass shooting, Munoz said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new law requires credit card networks to make the firearms code available to banks and other financial institutions by Monday. Those entities then have several months to determine which of their business clients should be categorized as gun stores and assign them new codes by May 1.\n\nVisa, the nation\u2019s largest payment network, recently updated its merchant data manual to add the firearms code to comply with California\u2019s law.\n\nDemocratic-led legislatures in Colorado and New York this year also passed firearms code mandates aligned to kick in with California\u2019s next May.\n\n\u201cIf there was someone suspiciously purchasing a large number of firearms, right now it would be very difficult to tell,\u201d said California state Assemblymember Phil Ting, a Democrat who sponsored the new law. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell if they were soccer balls or golf balls or basketballs.\u201d\n\nEven with a firearms store code, it won\u2019t be possible to know whether a particular sale is for a rifle, storage safe or some other product such as hunting apparel.\n\nThe state laws prohibiting gun store codes have varying effective dates but typically allow state attorneys general to seek court injunctions against financial institutions using the codes, with potential fines reaching thousands of dollars.\n\nThe merchant code could lead more people to buy guns with cash instead of credit in order to protect their privacy, said Dan Eldridge, owner of Maxon Shooter\u2019s Supplies in suburban Chicago. Though his business has yet to be recategorized, Eldridge said he already has placed an ATM in his store.\n\n\u201cViewed most benignly, this code is an effort to stigmatize gun owners,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cBut a more worrisome concern is that this is another private sector end run around the prohibition against the federal government creating a gun registry.\u201d\n\nIowa state Sen. Jason Schultz, a Republican sponsor of legislation banning the firearms code, said he feared federal agents could gain access to data about gun store purchases from financial institutions, then use that as justification to raid gun owners\u2019 homes and infringe on their Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cStates are going to have to make a choice,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether they want to follow California or whether they\u2019d like to support the original intent of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden family: remain in race despite dreadful debate",
        "body": "President Joe Biden\u2019s family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\n\nBiden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\n\nBut the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday\u2019s performance.\n\nWhile his family was aware of how poorly he performed against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he\u2019s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nAmong the most vocal: Jill Biden and son Hunter, whom the president has long gone to for counsel and advice. Both believe the president shouldn\u2019t bow out when he\u2019s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has spent the days since the debate \u2014 where he appeared raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers \u2014 working to keep donors and surrogates on board as Democrats increasingly questioned whether he should stay in the race.\n\nAt this point in the delegate process, Biden would likely have to decide to drop out for there to be a new nominee. And the people he listens to most in the world \u2014 his wife and son \u2014 are telling him to stay in.\n\nEven before the debate, the age of the 81-year-old Democratic president had been a liability with voters, and the prime-time faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will have in the four months until Election Day. CNN said more than 51 million people watched the debate.\n\nWhile the president was huddled with his family, prominent Democrats rallied to deliver a public show of support for his campaign on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\u201d said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. \u201cJoe Biden should continue to run on his record.\u201d\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, said there had been \u201cmore than a few Sundays when I wish I had preached a better sermon,\u201d relating the experience to Biden\u2019s debate performance.\n\n\u201cBut after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that\u2019s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,\u201d Warnock said. It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.\n\nWarnock, like Clyburn and others, pivoted to Trump\u2019s many falsehoods during the debate \u2014 lapses that Biden and the debate moderators often failed to fact check from the stage \u2014 including about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, immigration and the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWhenever his mouth was moving, he was lying,\u201d Warnock said of Trump.\n\nBut concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.\n\nFormer Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served for more than two decades with Biden in the Senate, called the debate \u201ca disaster from which Biden cannot recover.\u201d\n\nHarkin suggested that Democratic senators in pivotal races and \u201cmaybe all incumbent Democratic Senators should pen a letter to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d according to an email to supporters that was obtained by The Associated Press. It was first referenced in Iowa journalist Julie Gammack\u2019s column on Saturday, Iowa Potluck.\n\n\u201cThis is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,\u201d Harkin concluded.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described \u201cvery honest, serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party \u2026 about what to do.\u201d\n\nBut DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country \u2014 a group of some of the most influential members of the party \u2014 where they offered a rosy assessment of the path forward and gave no opportunity for others on the call to respond with questions.\n\nMultiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being asked to ignore a serious predicament.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn\u2019t get that. We were being gaslit,\u201d said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call.",
        "summary": "\u201cI do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\u201d said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.\nAnd that\u2019s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,\u201d Warnock said.\nIt was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.\nBut concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.\n\u201cThis is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,\u201d Harkin concluded.",

        "body": "Billionaire Bernard Arnault has joined the chase to purchase a storied Venice hotel, one of the trophy assets put on the market in the messy fallout from the implosion of Rene Benko\u2019s Signa Group.\n\nThe Hotel Bauer, located on the Grand Canal, was one of the crown jewels of the Austrian mogul\u2019s real estate empire. Despite its prime location and a history dating to 1880, the sales process has been caught up in Signa\u2019s complex creditor entanglements.\n\nThe Hotel Bauer, located on the Grand Canal Simone Padovani/Awakening/Getty Images\n\nKing Street Capital Management is running the sales process, according to people familiar with the matter. Filings show that funds administered by the credit hedge fund took control of shares in a Signa company that owned Hotel Bauer in May.\n\nThe asset has attracted bids of more than \u20ac275 million ($294 million), said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The process is competitive and includes property firms and other investors, meaning there\u2019s no guarantee that Arnault \u2014 the founder of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE \u2014 will get the nod, several people said.\n\nKing Street appointed real estate investment bank Eastdil Secured to find a buyer for the five-star hotel, said the people. Deliberations are ongoing and there\u2019s no certainty they will result in a deal, according to the people. King Street declined to comment, as did a representative for Arnault.\n\nSigna Prime Selection AG, the unit that owned the site, had agreed in April to sell three Italian properties, including Hotel Bauer, to the Schoeller Group, run by a German industrialist family of the same name. But a fund run by King Street has exercised rights to take control of the asset after the deal was announced.\n\nInvestment needed to reopen the 110-room hotel adds another complication for potential buyers. The site has been closed for a major renovation since 2022, and construction work stopped last year after Signa\u2019s cash ran low.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what role the Schoeller Group is playing in the ongoing bidding. Administrators of Signa Prime have been in negotiations with Schoeller for months over claims related to a \u20ac200 million loan they provided to unit in the months before it filed for insolvency. Signa Prime said it had reached a debt standstill with the group this month.\n\nA representative for Schoeller declined to immediately respond to Bloomberg questions.\n\nLMVH owns a string of high-end hotels and properties in the luxury hospitality sector, including the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. It\u2019s not clear whether the bidding would be done via LVMH or Agache \u2014 one of Arnault\u2019s holding companies \u2014 one of the people said.",

        "title": "French market rebounds and euro edges up after France's far-right wins first-round vote",
        "body": "French markets rebounded after Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party finished with a smaller margin of victory than indicated by polls, spurring a relief rally across the nation\u2019s assets.\n\nThe CAC 40 stock index surged almost 3% as Le Pen\u2019s opponents started strategizing on how to keep the far right out of power. Ten-year government bonds opened higher, narrowing the spread over 10-year German securities by as much as seven basis points \u2014 trimming a more than 30 basis point surge over the past two weeks.\n\nThe euro edged up, climbing as much as 0.6% to $1.0776, though still remained 0.5% weaker than where it was before President Emmanuel Macron called the snap vote in early June. Credit risk in the region plunged.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s party dominated the first round of voting Sunday. But Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front are now weighing whether to pull candidates from the second round to keep the far-right National Rally from securing an absolute majority on July 7.\n\n\u201cThe Leftist parties have indicated that they will withdraw candidates who came third in the 1st round to avoid splitting the vote next weekend,\u201d said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.\n\n\u201cThis should limit the ability of the far-right to win an outright majority in parliament. This is providing some relief this morning, though with uncertainty high, markets are likely to remain wary,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestors are concerned that Le Pen\u2019s party will pursue expansive fiscal policy. At a projected 5.3% of output this year, France\u2019s budget deficit already far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules and its debt is expected to rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect some relief-tightening in OAT-Bund spreads, there is still uncertainty ahead,\u201d said Evelyne Gomez-Liechti, a strategist at Mizuho. \u201cOur analysis suggests that any significant tightening will be unstable given worrying debt sustainability dynamics.\u201d\n\nLe Pen\u2019s National Rally locked up 33.2% of the vote, according to interior ministry figures. The New Popular Front got 28% and Macron\u2019s coalition got 20.8%.\n\nIf alliances forming to block Le Pen from absolute power start to look credible, French markets would likely recover, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n\u201cA hung parliament could make it hard to get anything done in France in the current parliament, which is exactly what the markets would like,\u201d she said.\n\nShares of French banks Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole all jumped on Monday, while the riskiest type of bonds issued by French lenders rose the most in weeks in early trading. Banks have been under pressure since Macron called the election due to rising political risk and the drop in French sovereign bonds.\n\nWhat Bloomberg strategists say\u2026\n\nIf the leftist alliance \u201cis aimed at blocking Le Pen\u2019s grouping from getting a majority in the crucial second round, it has wide-ranging implications for the France-German spread and indeed the euro. If the upshot is that we will get a more centrist government, it would be positive for the currency and herald a narrower spread.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ven Ram, cross-asset strategist for MLIV\n\nStill, strategists warn there is likely volatility ahead, as the electoral calculus gets complicated in the runoff when parties can strategically withhold candidates in certain constituencies to give a boost to a centrist hopeful.\n\nMacron\u2019s decision to call a snap vote in early June had sent markets into a tailspin.\n\nHis party \u2014 which supports large spending cuts to get France\u2019s budget deficit under control \u2014 suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections. National Rally, meanwhile, has touted some costly budget measures including lowering the sales tax on energy and fuel.\n\nOver the past three weeks, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French bonds over safer German debt rocketed to more than 80 basis points, levels last seen during the euro area\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. The euro fell to its lowest since early May.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see a \u201cmaterial and sustainable snapback,\u201d in French yields, said Peter Goves, head of developed market debt sovereign research at MFS Investment Management.\n\n\u201cUncertainties are high, French fundamentals haven\u2019t changed and the final outcome is still unknown and unknowable with the large number of three-way contests complicating matters,\u201d he said.",

They were trying to get a plane to Calgary.\n\nTheir 6:05 p.m. flight had been cancelled, and they wouldn\u2019t know until the evening whether a scheduled 7 a.m. flight the next day would go ahead.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of angry people in there,\u201d Temple-Murray said, pointing at the terminal.\n\nNearby, Grade 10 exchange student Marina Cebrian said she was supposed to be back home in Spain early Sunday, but now won\u2019t return to her family until Tuesday after enduring three flight cancellations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distressing,\u201d she said. \u201cI was supposed to be at home today, like seven hours ago, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nBoth WestJet and the Airplane Mechanics Fraternal Association have accused the other side of refusing to negotiate in good faith.\n\nThe union\u2019s goal remains a deal hammered out through bargaining rather than by an arbitrator \u2014 a route it opposed from the start.\n\nThe union says its demands around wages would cost WestJet less than $8 million Canadian (US$5.6 million) beyond what the company has offered for the first year of the collective agreement \u2014 the first contract between the two sides. It has acknowledged the gains would surpass compensation for industry colleagues across Canada and sit more on par with U.S. counterparts.\n\nWestJet says it has offered a 12.5% wage hike in the first year of the contract, and a compounded wage increase of 23.5% over the rest of the 5 1/2-year term.",

Reuters reported the per-share price earlier Sunday. Representatives for the companies declined to comment.\n\nBoeing plans to take control of the Spirit\u2019s manufacturing that supports its commercial jet line-up, including building frames for its cash-cow 737 Max, two of the people said. It will also gain control over a portion of Spirit\u2019s defense contract work, they said.\n\nBoeing arch-rival Airbus SE is also expected to announce that it\u2019s taking control over some of the Spirit factories that manufacture structures and components for its commercial aircraft. Terms for that transaction weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nBoeing is seeking to reintegrate Spirit after an accident in January on board a 737 Max-9 airliner revealed quality and manufacturing shortcomings at both Boeing and its most important supplier and led to a rethinking of their relationship.\n\nSpirit has faced growing financial pressure and scrutiny alongside Boeing after the door-shaped panel on a 737 Max 9 model blew out minutes after takeoff. Shipments of 737 fuselages have plummeted as Boeing steps up its inspections in Kansas and back at home near Seattle, and declined to accept aircraft structures with missing components or incomplete work.\n\nFor Boeing, the deal brings a key supplier for the 737, 787 Dreamliner and other commercial jets back in-house at a time when the company is feeling the financial strain from the slowed-down output. Boeing lost about $4 billion in cash in the first quarter and is set to lose a similar amount in the current three months of the year. The company\u2019s credit rating is hovering one level above speculative grade, and management is keen to avoid slipping into junk territory.\n\nThe Wichita campus that builds most of the 737 airframe for Boeing along with the nose sections of the 787 Dreamliners had been at the heart of several defects as it grappled with post-Covid workforce turnover.

        "body": "\u201c A Quiet Place: Day One \u201d is making noise at the box office. The prequel earned an estimated $53 million in its first weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s both a franchise best and significantly more than expected. Going into the weekend, prerelease tracking had \u201cDay One\u201d pegged for a $40 million debut, but audiences were clearly more enthusiastic to see the action-horror starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Joseph Quinn and released by Paramount. The same could not be said for Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201c Horizon: An American Saga\u2014Chapter 1,\u201d which opened to $11 million.\n\nThe \u201dQuiet Place\u201d victory wasn\u2019t quite enough to snag the coveted first place spot on the charts, though. That honor again went to Disney and Pixar\u2019s juggernaut \u201c Inside Out 2,\u201d which added an estimated $57.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, and crossed $1 billion globally.\n\nThere\u2019s a distant possibility that the places will shift when actuals are released Monday. But either way it\u2019s good news for movie theaters in a summer season that\u2019s finally heating up but still running far behind last year (down 19%) and pre-pandemic norms (down 36% from 2019).\n\n\u201cInside Out 2\u201d continues to be a box office phenomenon, the likes of which the industry hasn\u2019t seen since \u201cBarbie\u201d almost a year ago. In just three weeks of release, it\u2019s earned nearly $470 million in North America and $545.5 million internationally, bringing its global total to $1.01 billion. The sequel is the only 2024 release to cross the billion dollar mark and it did it in just 19 days, a record for an animated film.\n\n\u201cThe film\u2019s stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, in a statement.\n\n\u201cA Quiet Place: Day One,\u201d directed by Michael Sarnoski and rated PG-13, is also fast approaching an important threshold out of the gates. Including the $45.5 million from international showings in 59 markets, the $67 million production has already made $98.5 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love for the \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 franchise,\u201d said Chris Aronson, the head of domestic distribution for Paramount. \u201cWe listened to the fans who wanted to expand the universe.\u201d\n\nIn a rare feat for a third film, it opened higher than both \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d ($50.2 million opening in April 2018) and \u201c A Quiet Place: Part II \u201d ($47.5 million opening in May 2021). John Krasinski, who wrote and directed the first two, continued serving as a producer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those rare horror franchises that has generated incredible goodwill with audiences and critics alike,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nPlaying on 3,708 screens in the U.S. and Canada, nearly 40% of its domestic earnings came from \u201cpremium screens\u201d including IMAX and other large formats. It entered the marketplace with mostly positive reviews (84% on Rotten Tomatoes); Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore and four out of five stars on PostTrak.\n\n\u201cWe put together a compelling package but also I think it shows people want to go to the movies,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThe marketplace really works when there are choices and there\u2019s something for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe start for \u201cHorizon,\u201d meanwhile, was sluggish. Though older audiences, the ones most likely to support a Western epic, don\u2019t typically rush out to see films on opening weekend the way people often do for horrors and superheroes, the road ahead will not be easy: Reviews have not been great and it got an underwhelming B- CinemaScore.\n\nThe stakes are also a little different for \u201cHorizon,\u201d a $100 million production that Costner financed on his own and partnered with Warner Bros. to distribute. It opened in 3,334 locations. A decades-old passion project, he mortgaged property in Santa Barbara, Calif. to finance it and exited \u201cYellowstone\u201d to see it through. In a bold, unconventional strategy, \u201cChapter 2\u201d arrives in theaters later this summer, on Aug. 16. He also has plans for two more movies.\n\n\u201cThe western genre is one of those that is very specific,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about the long game.\u201d\n\nA quick glance at the top 10 shows that audiences are largely favoring franchises and \u201cknown commodities\u201d over originals. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d was right behind \u201cHorizon\u201d on the charts, and it\u2019s been in theaters for four weeks already.\n\n\u201cAudiences in the summer want the tried and true, they want the familiar,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nHe was also struck by the diversity of genres in the top 10, including two Indian films: The Telugu language sci-fi \u201cKalki 2898 AD\u201d in fifth place with $5.4 million and the Punjabi language \u201cJatt & Juliet 3\u201d in ninth place with $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t find something that appeals to you at the multiplex right now, you\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d $57.4 million.\n\n2. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One,\u201d $53 million.\n\n3. \u201cHorizon: An American Saga\u2014Chapter 1,\u201d $11 million.\n\n4. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d $10.3 million.\n\n5. \u201cKalki 2898 AD,\u201d $5.4 million.\n\n6. \u201cThe Bikeriders,\u201d $3.3 million.\n\n7. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d $2 million.\n\n8. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d $168.1 million.\n\n9. \u201cJatt & Juliet 3,\u201d $1.5 million.\n\n10. \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d $1.5 million.",

        "body": "The U.S. Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.\n\nBoeing will have until the end of the coming week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, they said.\n\nThe case stems from the department\u2019s determination that Boeing violated an agreement that was intended to resolve a 2021 charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. Prosecutors alleged at the time that Boeing misled regulators who approved the 737 Max and set pilot-training requirements to fly the plane. The company blamed two relatively low-level employees for the fraud.\n\nThe Justice Department told relatives of some of the 346 people who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes about the plea offer during a video meeting. The family members, who want Boeing to face a criminal trial and to pay a $24.8 billion fine, reacted angrily. One said prosecutors were gaslighting the families; another shouted at them for several minutes when given a chance to speak.\n\n\u201cWe are upset. They should just prosecute,\u201d said Massachusetts resident Nadia Milleron, whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the second of two 737 Max crashes. \u201cThis is just a reworking of letting Boeing off the hook.\u201d\n\nProsecutors told the families that if Boeing rejects the plea offer, the Justice Department would seek a trial in the matter, meeting participants said. Justice Department officials presented the offer to Boeing during a meeting later Sunday, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nBoeing and the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe plea deal would take away the ability of U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor to increase Boeing\u2019s sentence for a conviction, and some of the families plan to ask the Texas judge to reject the deal if Boeing agrees to it.\n\n\u201cThe underlying outrageous piece of this deal is that it doesn\u2019t acknowledge that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people,\u201d said Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers for victims\u2019 families. \u201cBoeing is not going to be held accountable for that, and they are not going to admit that that happened.\u201d\n\nSanjiv Singh, a lawyer for 16 families who lost relatives in the October 2018 Lion Air crash off Indonesia, called the plea offer \u201cextremely disappointing.\u201d The terms, he said, \u201cread to me like a sweetheart deal.\u201d\n\nAnother lawyer representing families who are suing Boeing, Mark Lindquist, said he asked the head of the Justice Department\u2019s fraud section, Glenn Leon, whether the department would add additional charges if Boeing turns down the plea deal. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t commit one way or another,\u201d Lindquist said.\n\nThe meeting with crash victims\u2019 families came weeks after prosecutors told O\u2019Connor that the American aerospace giant breached the January 2021 deal that had protected Boeing from criminal prosecution in connection with the crashes. The second one took place in Ethiopia less than five months after the one in Indonesia.\n\nA conviction could jeopardize Boeing\u2019s status as a federal contractor, according to some legal experts. The company has large contracts with the Pentagon and NASA.\n\nHowever, federal agencies can give waivers to companies that are convicted of felonies to keep them eligible for government contracts. Lawyers for the crash victims\u2019 families expect that would be done for Boeing.\n\nBoeing paid a $244 million fine as part of the 2021 settlement of the original fraud charge. The Justice Department is likely to seek another, similar penalty as part of the new plea offer, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing to discuss an ongoing case.\n\nThe deal would include a monitor to oversee Boeing \u2014 but the company would put forward three nominees and have the Justice Department pick one, or ask Boeing for additional names. That provision was particularly hated by the family members on the call, participants said.\n\nThe Justice Department also gave no indication of moving to prosecute any current or former Boeing executives, another long-sought demand of the families.\n\nLindquist, a former prosecutor, said officials made clear during an earlier meeting that individuals \u2013 even CEOs \u2013 can be more sympathetic defendants than corporations. The officials pointed to the 2022 acquittal on fraud charges of Boeing\u2019s chief technical pilot for the Max as an example.\n\nIt is unclear what impact a plea deal might have on other investigations into Boeing, including those following the blowout of a panel called a door plug from the side of a Boeing Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.",

Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.\u201d\n\nDar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.\n\nThe two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.\n\nPort users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.\n\nAccording to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.\n\n\u201cAll our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don\u2019t know where to send additional ones,\u201d he says.\n\nDar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.\n\nTanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai\u2019s DP World and India\u2019s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.\n\nThe country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.\n\nMombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region\u2019s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.\n\nDP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.\n\nDP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.\n\nThe agreement aims to optimise the port\u2019s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.\n\nAdani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port\u2019s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.\n\nWith this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.\n\nKenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.\n\nLast year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.\n\nDar Port, handles 90 percent of Tanzania\u2019s trade, clearing $15 billion of merchandise annually.\n\nDP World has begun to enhance the port's efficiency with new equipment and systems, promising significant economic benefits for Tanzania and its neighbouring countries.\n\nRecently, the port witnessed the operation of ship-to-shore cranes for the first time, powered by mega generators moved into the terminal by DP World.\n\nThis new infrastructure enabled the completion of the first sulfur vessel in a record four days, marking a historic milestone for the port.\n\nAdditionally, the modernisation efforts have allowed the longest vessel ever to dock at the port.",

        "title": "How Kenya paid Sh197bn interest on debut Eurobond",
        "body": "Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.\n\nThe interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday\u2019s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.\n\nThis bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.\n\nEurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.\n\nThis is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.\n\nEurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.\n\nFor the five-year bond\u2014which the government repaid in June 2019\u2014the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.\n\nThe 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.\n\n\u201cPayment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,\u201d Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.\n\nAt the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.\n\nThe government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.\n\nIn the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.\n\nIn the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.\n\nIn agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.\n\nA special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.\n\nThis made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.\n\nSubsequent Eurobond sales have tended to go towards general funding of the budget, or repaying other maturing debt.\n\nIn February 2018, part of the proceeds of the second Eurobond sale, which raised Sh202 billion, was used to retire syndicated loans contracted in 2015 and 2017.",

        "body": "President William Ruto faces public scrutiny and delicate juggling over his pledge to cut non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb the wastage of funds.\n\nOfficial estimates showed that the items listed as non-essential for the President\u2019s office total Sh667 million\u2014 putting the focus on the size of chops that would be effected to justify his austerity promise while avoiding inconvenience to his day-to-day activities.\n\nCuts to travel expenditure may see Dr Ruto reduce local and foreign trips, while the planned refurbishment of his office in Nairobi\u2019s Central Business District and the modernisation of the government printing press could also be halted in the rationalisation plan.\n\nThe pronouncement by the President proposing cuts to his office budget was forced upon by days of deadly protests in which the public demanded an end to wasteful and frivolous spending by the State amidst lean times caused by high debt levels.\n\nThe proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.\n\n\u201cI direct immediate further austerity measures extending to the entire Executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,\u201d President Ruto said.\n\nThe listed spending areas had an allocation of Sh667 million for the financial year starting today, according to data from the National Treasury budget books.\n\nSpending on domestic and foreign travel had been estimated at Sh10.4 million and Sh7.5 million respectively, a higher allocation compared to the Sh5.2 million and Sh7.2 million programmed in the budget ended June 30. The hospitality supplies and services budget was however lower at Sh84.7 million in contrast to Sh144.1 million previously.\n\nThe purchase of vehicles and other transport equipment for the Executive Office of the President would have however gobbled up Sh50 million from Sh27.3 million previously.\n\nOther recurrent spending areas for the office cover printing, advertising, and information supplies and services; training expenses, purchase of fuel and lubricants, purchase of office furniture and the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.\n\nProposed cuts to development spending by the office cover the refurbishment of buildings at Harambee House which hosts the Executive Office of the President and the modernisation of the press and refurbishment of buildings at the government printer which sits on Haile Selassie Avenue in the capital city.\n\nThe budget to refurbish the President's office in Nairobi CBD was set at Sh14.3 million while the upgrade of the government printer would cost Sh500 million.\n\nThe total budget to the Executive Office of the President had been set at Sh5.3 billion for the year to June 2025.\n\nPresident William Ruto can implement the desired changes to the Sh3.92 trillion budget through the 1st supplementary estimates for the 2024/25 financial year having signed the 2024 Appropriations Bill into law on Friday as passed by MPs.\n\nThe President indicated that the supplementary budget would achieve cuts of Sh346 billion covering the hole resulting from the withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill.\n\nThe initial Sh3.92 trillion budget included Sh2.78 trillion in recurrent spending, Sh687.9 billion in development spending, Sh446.1 billion in transfers to counties including equitable share, Sh43.6 billion to Parliament, and Sh23.6 billion to the Judiciary.\n\nThe National Treasury expected to fund the budget through Sh3.3 trillion in total revenue collections including Sh2.91 trillion in taxes, leaving behind a balance of Sh597 billion to be plugged by Sh33.8 billion in external financing and Sh263.2 billion in domestic borrowing.",

        "title": "Leaders gaslighting us to submission",
        "body": "The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines gaslighting as the psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories and typically leads to confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem, uncertainty of one's emotional or mental stability and a dependency on the perpetrator.\n\nThe dictionary continues to explain that the term gaslighting originated from the title of a 1938 play and the movies based on that play, the plots of which involve a man attempting to make his wife believe that she is going insane. His mysterious activities in the attic cause the house\u2019s gas lights to dim, but he insists to his wife that the lights are not dimming and that she can\u2019t trust her own perceptions.\n\nI ended my column last Monday by saying that following the Gen Z protests the previous week, corporate leaders need Gen Z mentors to help them get a real-time understanding of their current and future customers. Then things became hotter last Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nGas flame hot. Conversations on various social media platforms became emotive, passionate and even incendiary. Two debates on two different groups that I am a member of stood out for me. The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this. One MP hugged a mute tree and remained as silent as a Manchester United fan at a Premier League Recent Winner\u2019s Whatsapp group as the group chatter went on and on about how tone-deaf the political class were choosing to be against their constituents.\n\nThe second MP chose to leap off the self-incriminating cliff with defensive clapbacks on why they voted yes, once a video of them speaking in Parliament supporting the controversial Finance Bill was posted on the group. This MP thumped their chest and said they had nothing to apologise for. The abuses that followed sent the second MP to join the first one sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.\n\nThe second debate was on a different group of professional colleagues. Amongst them is a senior public servant who chose to come in and throw a grenade. Rather than reading the room where there was also much discussion about the reason behind the tax protests, the individual chose to paint a picture of chaos, fear and despondency if the protests, which by this time had started having violent outcomes, didn\u2019t end.\n\nThe individual did not for a single minute explain the rationale behind the Finance Bill. Not a single minute. Consequently, many of the other group members called the individual out, asking them to remove the rose-tinted glasses and red carpet-lined blinkers that were blocking them from seeing what the mood of the nation was. Following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill later that day, nothing has been heard from the individual who likely joined the other MPs sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.\n\nLegislators post dancing videos on Tiktok, swaying their hips with shiny faces lifted to the Range Rover heavens, thanking their Lexus gods for the far they have come.\n\nWhen called out for the exuberance of their instant coffee wealth, they rubbish the naysayers and call them jealous. They gaslight the public and tell them how a stable country is critical for prosperity and that the new taxes will be good for the country. They look for an evil bogeyman who is pulling the strings of resistance, since Kenyans are unable, neither individually nor collectively, to see wanton wastage and blatant corruption.\n\nWe get it, dear public servants. We get it completely. You know better than us what is good for us. You know what good governance looks like from the third floor of your newly purchased Karen villas. You rush to give us good governance as your chase cars run us off the road, with the ubiquitous dour-faced bodyguard pointing an ashen walkie-talkie holding wrist at us for daring to share the same tarmac that you do.",

        "title": "Mary Wamae: Iron lady that has shaped Equity Group\u2019s recent success exits",
        "body": "As she charts the next path after leaving the board of directors of Equity Group Holdings, Mary Wangari Wamae will be opening a fresh chapter in her rich personal story.\n\nShe was the group executive director for Equity Holdings, a role that saw her oversee all of the bank's subsidiaries. Besides the long-serving CEO James Mwangi and the founder and former chairman Peter Munga, Ms Wamae is perhaps the only other prominent personality who has shaped the history of Equity Bank.\n\nAs one promotion followed the other, rumours swirled that she was being groomed to replace Mwangi. Her exit puts to rest those rumours.\n\nMs Wamae is certainly one of the authors of Equity's recent success story, which started with a remarkable turnaround that saw Equity miraculously escape dissolution by the regulator after years of operating under insolvency. When Wamae joined Equity in 2004, after a 13-year legal practice, she played a key role in writing the next chapter of Equity, chief among which was converting the financial institution from a troubled building society into a formidable pan-African bank with a presence in seven countries.\n\nMs Wamae, a lawyer by training, was also part of the team that helped Equity Bank list on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), giving the lender the impetus to make the great leap into Pan-African banking.\n\nA conglomerate with business interests spanning different sectors, Equity Group would become the first company in the region to cross the Sh1 trillion in assets in 2020.\n\nThere is just something about Wamae and Mwangi that makes them the perfect bearers of Equity Bank's DNA: They both had humble beginnings and were raised by single mothers in rural Central Kenya.\n\nIt is these modest beginnings which informed Equity's reincarnation as a bank for the common mwananchi, with the tier-one lender revolutionizing micro-lending in Kenya.\n\nIn the 1990s, banks were snobbish. They didn\u2019t think the poor people like Mwangi's and Wamae's mothers were bankable.\n\nThe income for most of these poor rural folks was not only erratic, but it was also unreliably erratic. Banks slammed their doors on Wanjiku, and she clammed up with her money.\n\nThus, Wamae, who was also brought up in hardship in Kenya, was a perfect catch for Equity's spirit when she joined the company in 2004 as the secretary. Just like Mwangi, she embodied the fighting spirit of Equity Bank.\n\nIn a past interview, Wamae credited her mother for bequeathing her with the fighting spirit, and not to complain despite difficult circumstances one may find themselves in.\n\nRaised in Nyeri County by a single mother in a family of six children, Ms Wangari did not have an easy childhood. Her mother did not have a fixed income but she made all efforts to educate her.\n\nShe powered through her education journey with finesse, picking a reading habit in the process. Later in life, she became an avid reader.\n\nWhen she graduated with a law degree from the University of Nairobi (UoN) in 1990, Ms Wangari was beginning the journey towards breaking from the obscurity that her background risked driving her to.\n\nJoining UoN offered her the chance to visit the capital for the first time in her life. She was in the famous UoN class that had the likes of Trade Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano, MPs Millie Odhiambo and Caroli Omondi, lawyers like Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Azimio leader Raila Odinga\u2019s lawyer Paul Mwangi, Supreme Court judge Isaac Lenaola, among others.\n\nThe class has a grouping called MV90 and Ms Wangari once did a video explaining the unique aspects of the group.\n\nA mother of three girls, Ms Wangari had a divorce in 2018. She told the Business Daily in a 2022 interview that the divorce affected her.\n\n\u201cI asked God questions,\u201d she said. \u201cI have done many successful projects, overseen successful investments in this bank that run in a trillion, but why couldn\u2019t I make my marriage succeed? How come this project failed?\u201d\n\nIn the interview, she also spoke of the need for women to be financially independent so that in case something goes wrong in their marriages, they have a way out.\n\nHer Nairobi residence is proof that she has established herself financially, and in a recent interview in the palatial residence, where she spoke about her love for books, she was happy to show the Business Daily her home library, which has quite a collection of books.\n\nMs Wangari has lately been giving mentorship sessions about money and investments, and she said she is reading a lot on the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing quite a lot of mentorship on that,\u201d she said. \u201c[Books] help me to consolidate my thoughts around that topic\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead people when I mentor them, because sometimes they take what you say as the gospel truth.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Ms Wangari released her biography The Village Girl: My Dream, Life and Legacy where she set out her story in full, candidly capturing the moments in her life that needed her to be resilient and to show leadership. Her policy is that biographies should not always be about the good things that happen to people.\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency to only tell the good things,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a book is written in a way that it only depicts the good part of it, either the good part of an individual or the good things that happen to them, then of course we have question marks: Is it real? Is it authentic? That is why now people are looking for authentic stories because an authentic and balanced story will talk about the peaks, but it will also talk about the lows.\u201d\n\nShe practised as a lawyer for 13 years before joining Equity Group, seeing it transform into the regional behemoth it is today.\n\nMs Wangari started a reading club for women at the bank, called the Equity Inspire Programme (Equip), as she sought to prepare female bankers for leadership roles.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the programme is to encourage them and help them to equip themselves with the right skills, the right knowledge, the right confidence to lead in a bank and financial services group like Equity,\u201d she told the Business Daily.",

        "body": "Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firms Williamson Tea and Kapchorua Tea have called for the destruction of huge stocks of unsold tea held by the giant Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to save the industry from being choked by excess supplies of the commodity which has hurt prices.\n\nThe two tea firms, which share majority owners, said in separate financial filings on Friday that tea prices have fallen to unsustainable levels as a result of market saturation, while also hitting out at the minimum pricing system that has hit producers who are unable to supply top grade tea.\n\nIn 2022, the State set a minimum price of $2.43(Sh 314.73) per kilogramme on KTDA to safeguard farmers\u2019 earnings. Farmers affiliated with KTDA account for about 60 percent of Kenya\u2019s tea production.\n\nImproved production, coupled with a weaker shilling in 2023, helped Kapchorua and Williamson Tea book higher revenue in the year to March 2024, but they say that future profits are under threat due to the current situation at the auction.\n\nWilliamson Tea\u2019s net profit for the period fell by 6.6 percent to Sh527 million, as higher costs ate into a 4.4 percent increase in revenue to Sh4.19 billion. Kapchorua\u2019s net profit rose by 27 percent to Sh399.4 million, as its top-line revenue jumped 23.7 percent to Sh2.19 billion. Both are paying a final dividend of Sh15 per share, which when added to their interim dividends of Sh10 per share paid out earlier, brings their total dividend in the year to March to Sh25 per share.\n\n\u201cDespite the positive results of the period, the prospects for the company and Kenyan tea industry are dire. Tea prices have declined to unsustainable levels in the face of market saturation and the consequences of an estimated 200 million kilogrammes of unsold KTDA teas,\u201d said Williamson Tea in its financial report for the year ended March 2024.\n\n\u201cDramatic action is required to enable the market to return to a normal dynamic and for prospects to improve. The destruction of all unsold KTDA teas and the removal of the auction minimum pricing system is needed with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe Mombasa auction runs on a two-day format where secondary-grade quality tea is sold on Mondays and premium-grade ones on Tuesdays.\n\nAny tea that is not sold on a scheduled auction day is reprinted on a fresh auction catalogue and returned to the auction two weeks later. A seller is only allowed to bring back unsold crops to the auction twice.\n\nAny crop unsold after two auction trials is relegated to a sale window referred to as a \u201cpassive window\u201d where produce fetches low pricing on perceived low quality.\n\nWith the minimum price in place, buyers shun lower quality tea\u2014which they are unwilling to buy at the higher minimum price\u2014 leading to a rise in unsold stock at a time when production has gone up due to favourable weather.",

        "body": "Expenditure on imports from Uganda declined 9.09 per cent in the first quarter of the year, pointing to the impact of an on-and-off tiff between Nairobi and Kampala over the entry of key farm goods such as eggs and milk powder.\n\nThe value of goods trucked into Kenya from Uganda through formal routes dropped to Sh7.48 billion in the three months through March 2024 compared with Sh8.23 billion the year before, according to provisional official trade statistics.\n\nReduced imports from Uganda at the time exports grew 7.17 per cent to Sh33.02 billion, helped widen Kenya\u2019s goods trade surplus with its largest business partner to Sh25.54 billion from Sh22.58 billion the year before.\n\nUganda has over the years complained of a blockade of goods such as eggs, sugar, milk powder, and grains in protectionist policies aimed at shielding Kenyan farmers.\n\nThe rising trade barrier between the two nations was part of the agenda during Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s two-day State visit to Nairobi in early May.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed that trade between the two countries is unimpeded either by tariff or non-tariff barriers or arbitrary levies,\u201d Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto said on May 16 following Mr Museveni\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed that the common principle will be the full implementation of the EAC customs and other infrastructure that support trade between East African countries. Therefore, all the issues around rice, juice, furniture, eggs, chicken, and sugar are now resolved.\u201d\n\nBrookside Limited, owned by parent company Brookside Dairy of Kenya, however, said it is among the most affected businesses, with up to 114 export permits denied by the Kenya Dairy Board since March last year.\n\n\u201cWe were delighted to read the communique signed by the two countries when the two heads of State met in Nairobi, as we believe it was key to unlocking trade barriers that have existed since March last year. However, a month later, we are yet to receive export permits for our long-life milk, which includes powder and ultra-high temperature (UHT) processed milk,\u201d Benson Mwangi, Brookside Limited\u2019s general manager, told a media briefing in Kampala last week.\n\nAlthough Kenya has been Uganda\u2019s main market for dairy products, emerging trade restrictions have seen Kampala search for new markets, mainly in North and West Africa.\n\nMr Mwangi said Brookside Limited had written several reminders to the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) on the pending permit applications.\n\nStill, unfortunately, no response has been received so far from the regulator. \u201cWe are optimistic that KDB could soon implement the tenets of the communique by the two heads of state, which would unlock the impasse and allow us to resume export of our products,\u201d Mr Mwangi said.\n\nEast African Community (EAC) Customs Union Protocol, the bloc\u2019s first integration breakthrough which came into force in 2005, allows the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour within the bloc.\n\nThe seven-member trading has, however, continued to experience unending trade tiffs, slowing growth in intra-regional trade despite the bloc being the most integrated in Africa.\n\nImports from Tanzania, for instance, fell by a third (32.69 percent) in the first quarter of 2023 to Sh7.99 billion when Dar es Salaam restricted sale of grains to neighbouring countries.\n\nThe measures were part of food export restrictions which Dar es Salaam started enforcing in 2022 to ensure food security in a trading bloc that perennially experiences deficit in maize, a staple.",

        "body": "For the longest time, whenever Kenyan marketers wanted to engage masses on social media platforms, they have relied on uploading posts.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, X has emerged as a powerhouse in assembling mass audiences through its \u2018Spaces\u2019. The feature allows conveners to connect to audiences, share ideas as well as gather feedback.\n\nIt allows for a maximum of up to 13 speakers including the host and two co-hosts at any given time, while the number of listeners who can join is unlimited.\n\nAt the height of the anti-Finance Bill protests, organisers shattered records by setting up interactions that saw listeners hit highs of over 130,000, demonstrating the efficiency of the platform to gather mass audiences of diverse walks of life using minimal resources.\n\nUnveiled in December 2020 to encourage individuals and businesses to build more personal connections with their audiences, the feature which acts like a virtual room allows users to have live audio conversations.\n\nOther rival offerings, which have not gained as much traction, include Meta\u2019s beta app for Oculus Rift which allows Facebook friends to hang out in virtual reality as well as WhatsApp channels and WhatsApp communities which are close-knit group tools used to organise and manage conversations.\n\nAccording to digital marketing strategist Egline Samoei, X emerged as an effective tool for mobilisation during the protests because of its open structure that allows prioritisation of topics in feeds as opposed to individual relationships between interacting accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open and public platform in that you don\u2019t have to be friends with someone to view their postings hence the content reaches as many people as possible,\u201d she opines.\n\n\u201cX Spaces has proven to be a powerful feature on X. Businesses can leverage this feature for brand awareness, driving engagements and community-building conversations around products to provide a deeper level understanding which will in turn foster brand loyalty,\u201d she adds noting that the engagements are also fertile ground from which businesses would pick valuable customer insights.\n\nHer sentiments are echoed by Dennis Maina, managing partner at digital marketing agency Suss Digital Africa, who calls on marketers to stay adaptive and forward-thinking.\n\n\u201cThe digital marketing landscape is in a constant state of flux, and success lies in the ability to not just ride the waves but to anticipate and leverage the currents that propel the industry forward,\u201d he states. \u201cMarketers need to ensure each interaction contributes to a unified brand image and a consistent narrative.\u201d\n\nOther gains derived from hosting the conversations include increased visibility on the general platform, helping businesses network with relevant influencers, offering an opening to demonstrate expertise as a specialised authority as well as strengthening relationships with customers.\n\nBut how do you amass the numbers?\n\nThe pundits explain that the first step is always building a strong community that discusses topics of collective interest, while also taking care to occasionally throw in themes around general trends to sustain interest.\n\nAccording to Ms Samoei, one of the key primary challenges that businesses seeking to pursue the route will grapple with is maintaining a consistency of high-quality topics that keep audiences engaged throughout.\n\n\u201cAlso, since the x Spaces is public, one may face brand hijacking or brand safety issues. It\u2019s worth mentioning that sometimes the X Space may experience glitches making the Spaces inaccessible for some users,\u201d she states.",

        "title": "Naivety: Do you have this innovators\u2019 superpower?",
        "body": "I fondly remember an opportunity in telecommunications where a local telco was struggling with the implementation of service and risked going over budget and being out of allocated time. Their partner in the project was a large multinational organisation that had deployed similar solutions for a handful of other peers in different markets.\n\nBy all measures, ambition, and logic, this should have been a walk in the park, with world-class infrastructure, fantastic pedigree in talent, and subscribed standards. What remained unaccounted for was the deep fragmentation in devices on the network at the time, meaning that suddenly the standard would not deliver. Enter naivety.\n\nWhen we think about the concept of disruption, we are inclined to imagine that it requires one to be well-versed in an industry, sector, product, service, or process. Shouldn't the best solutions come from those who understand the intricacies of the problem they are solving?\n\nAbsolutely! But sometimes, the biggest roadblock to innovation is not a lack of knowledge, but an acceptance of the status quo, better articulated as standards.\n\nIn this story, I tasked my team to think through possible solutions to the problem, with a deliberate decision made not to mention the \"problematic\u201d standard. To be clear, the issue was not in the standard itself, as it addressed the section of the market, but that its presence and prior deployment success blinded those on the project to any other options, including going back to the drawing board.\n\nIn a few weeks, across multiple sprints, the team delivered a solution that passed the test for problem fit, deployed, and scaled to great success.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may sound, the ability to look at a problem or opportunity through virgin eyes can many times be the differentiator in creating and unlocking value.\n\nLook at the innovations celebrated now. They may seem obvious after the fact but were most likely viewed as ludicrous at the beginning. You must question and interrogate how things have always been done, to either take a tangent and chart a new path or improve on the current one.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. Unchecked, naivety can be a recipe for disaster. While a clear-eyed view of the problem cum opportunity is essential, so is a healthy respect for the realities of the industry.

        "body": "One of the most often reported forms of irritation is back pain. If you deal with back discomfort regularly, you undoubtedly already know a few standard preventative measures. You can take steps to improve your posture, stand up straight while moving, and make sure you're sitting comfortably in your chair while working.\n\nThere are the same number of vertebrates in each person's spine, regardless of height. And that's where the issue is. Taller people seem to have larger vertebrates, yet we may all have the same amount. However, the increase in size may not always correspond with an increase in width, which makes it more difficult for the core muscles to withstand the impacts of those longer levers and limbs.\n\nWhy tall people get back pain\n\n\u2022 Bad posture: tall people tend to slouch or adopt poor posture habits to accommodate their height, which can strain the back muscles and lead to discomfort or pain.\n\n\u2022 Injuries- tall people are prone to injuries, especially in sports where longer limbs mean a long distance to the ground.\n\n\u2022 Increased spinal stress- tall individuals often have longer spines, which can result in increased stress on spinal discs and vertebrae. This extra stress can contribute to conditions like herniated discs, spinal stenosis and other back issues.\n\n\u2022 Muscle imbalances- the musculature of tall individuals may be imbalanced due to their height, leading to certain muscles becoming overworked while others are underutilised.\n\n\u2022 Joint strain- Tall people may experience increased strain on their joints due to the longer lever arms in their limbs. This strain can affect the ligament of the spine and contribute to back problems.\n\n\u2022 Genetics- while height itself is not a direct cause of back problems, certain genetic factors that contribute to a person's height may also play a role in their susceptibility to back issues.\n\nPreventive measures to avoid back pain\n\n\u2022 Core and back-strengthening exercises.\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a good posture, sit and stand erect without slouching. Avoid looking down at your phone or other devices for extended periods. Keep your face forward as much as possible.\n\n\u2022 Also you can use a lumbar support cushion in your seat to prevent low back pain and find ways to keep the spine aligned while you sleep. That means getting a comfortable pillow, updating your mattress and sleeping on your sides rather than your stomach.\n\n\u2022 Drinking water also helps to hydrate your joints and keep them flexible.\n\n\u2022 Routine physiotherapy care can also prevent back problems from progressing.\n\nPhysiotherapy management of back pain\n\n\u2022Early activity, encouraging early movement in back pain is one of the significant aspects of treatment in back pain.\n\n\u2022 Specific stabilisation exercises, helps in improving strength and stability of the muscles which have been weakened due to back pain.\n\n\u2022 Postural guidelines, guiding the patient about correct postural habits and ways to maintain accurate posture and avoid back pain\n\n\u2022 Mobilisation or manipulative physiotherapy concentrates on promoting mobilisation of the specific affected area and is used to target the specific point of pain.\n\n\u2022 General exercises and stretches, structured exercises and stretches are usually carried out in the context of patients' individual condition and cause of back pain.\n\n\u2022 Ergonomic advice- since work-related hazards account for more than 65 percent of back problems, physiotherapists also concentrate on providing accurate ergonomic devices, guiding the patient using the appropriate infrastructure at work to avoid and cure back pain.",

        "title": "Down Syndrome: How can I tell if my child will have it?",
        "body": "Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two. Chromosomes are small \u201cpackages\" of genes in the body. They determine how a baby's body forms and functions as it grows in the womb and after birth.\n\nHere is more to this condition that you need to know about.\n\nHow it occurs\n\nA normal baby is born with 46 chromosomes (each cell contains 23 pairs), but babies with Down Syndrome have 47. This extra chromosome changes how the baby's body and brain develop, which can cause both mental and physical challenges for the baby. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal disorder.\n\nA person with Down Syndrome can be identified by their unique physical features, which include a flattened face, slanted eyes, a short neck, small ears, a tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth, small hands and feet and tiny spots on the iris of the eye. They also tend to be shorter in height than children and adults with poor muscle tone.\n\nClassical Down Syndrome is not an inherited condition. It usually occurs because of a chance happening at the time of conception. However, in rare cases, (less than 5 percent), some recombinant genetic errors can be transmitted from parents to their offspring. Increasing maternal age after 35 years is one of the known risk factors.\n\nDiagnosis during pregnancy\n\nThere are two tests available to detect Down Syndrome during pregnancy: screening tests and diagnostic tests. A screening test can tell a woman and her healthcare provider whether her pregnancy has a lower, or higher chance of having the condition, but it does not provide an absolute diagnosis. They are safer than diagnostic tests for the mother and the developing baby.\n\nScreening tests often include a combination of a blood test, which measures the amount of various substances in the mother's blood, and an ultrasound, which creates a picture of the baby. During an ultrasound, one of the things the technician looks at is the fluid behind the baby's neck. Extra fluid in this region could indicate a genetic problem.\n\nDiagnostic tests, on the other hand, can typically detect whether, or not a baby will have Down Syndrome, but they can be riskier for the mother and the developing baby.\n\nThese tests are usually performed after a positive screening test to confirm a Down Syndrome diagnosis by looking for changes in the chromosomes that would indicate the condition. This involves examining material from the placenta, the amniotic fluid and blood from the umbilical cord. Some of these tests may carry some risks depending on gestation and need to be discussed with the doctor.\n\nOther complications\n\nApart from its effects on appearance, Down Syndrome can cause a number of medical complications. Some of these are more serious than others, but most of them can be treated. The most serious complications include heart defects, blood disorders like Leukemia and immune system problems.\n\nApproximately half of all babies with Down Syndrome are born with heart defects. Usually, these defects affect the walls separating the four chambers of the heart. The condition can also cause blood cell abnormalities such as leukaemia.\n\nThe immune system of people with Down Syndrome is compromised and they are more vulnerable to infections, certain kinds of cancer and autoimmune conditions.\n\nThey also suffer from stomach and digestive problems including abnormally formed digestive organs that may require surgery and celiac disease, a condition that impairs their ability to absorb nutrients, especially gluten.\n\nDown Syndrome can affect the way the body produces or responds to hormones causing hormonal disorders that contribute to obesity problems and Type 1 diabetes. People with Down Syndrome also suffer from skeletal problems caused by too much flexibility between the bones at the top of the spine that support the head.\n\nOther less serious complications include intellectual disability, vision problems, hearing impairment, skin disorders, behavioural and psychological problems, height and weight, sleep apnea and fertility problems, especially in men.\n\nIs Down Syndrome curable?\n\nThough there is no cure for Down Syndrome, there are services available to help babies and children improve their physical and intellectual abilities. The management requires a multidisciplinary medical team approach.",

        "body": "The National Housing Corporation (NHC) is stuck with hundreds of houses valued close to Sh1.3 billion it has been unable to sell, even as the government pumps more through its affordable housing programme.\n\nLatest details reveal that by June last year, the corporation had a stock of unsold houses across different parts of the country, some of which were completed years ago but have not attracted buyers.\n\n\u201cThe statement of financial position reflects an inventories balance of Sh1,305,018,402 which includes an amount of Sh1,275,730,014 relating to stock of unsold houses held by the Corporation. As previously reported, despite some of the projects having been completed several years ago, the houses have remained unsold and hence they continue to be reported as inventories,\u201d Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes in a report.\n\nNHC housing units sell at between Sh1.58million and Sh8.75million, depending on the size and location. For instance, a studio apartment under the affordable housing scheme retails at Sh1.58 million while the most expensive three-bedroom master ensuite unit goes for Sh8.75 million. Although the auditor-general does not specify the number of unsold units, projections show that they are in their hundreds going by the Sh1.3 billion total value.\n\nThis raises questions on how the State will market the thousands of houses it has lined up with billions of shillings already being pumped into the programme.\n\nPresident William Ruto continues to insist on the importance of the affordable housing project in the creation of jobs for youth but the government has been silent on how it will ensure the units are sold after completion, with the majority of targeted beneficiaries being low-income earners.\n\nFormally employed Kenyans have since July last year been deducted 1.5 percent of their salaries towards the Housing Levy Tax, with the amounts being channelled to the Housing Fund.\n\nBut the auditor-general now reveals that with the \u201cstock of unsold houses\" constructed over the years continuing to pile, NHC is now having to approach individuals and institutions to buy them, to no success.\n\n\u201cManagement explained that it has scaled up engagement with County Governments, Saccos, Kenyans in the diaspora, and other relevant institutions to market the unsold houses,\u201d Ms Gathungu says in her report on NHC.\n\nUnable to offload the houses to the market, NHC has been forced to rent out houses worth Sh843 million, but Sh433 million houses remain idle.\n\nOn its website, the NHC lists at least 10 projects where it has residential houses it is selling. They include Kisumu Kanyakwar, Phase Three where it has 100 houses, and Stoni in Athi River where it has 160 unsold affordable houses and 110 unsold affordable houses in Homa Bay.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, the Corporation may not have obtained value for money for the schemes implemented at Sh1,275,730,014 included under inventories,\u201d the audit notes.\n\nIn its expression of commitment to Housing, the government budgeted Sh92.1 billion to the sector for the fiscal year starting July, including Sh67.4 billion that will go to affordable and social housing.\n\nThis is more than thrice the Sh28 billion budget the government allocated to Housing in the 2023/24 fiscal year, though only Sh5.45 billion had been spent by the end of May.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s commitment is to turn the housing challenge into an economic opportunity to create quality jobs for the youth directly in the construction sector and indirectly through the production of building products,\u201d Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung\u2019u said while delivering the 2024/25 budget.\n\nThe government\u2019s plan- which has not been achieved so far- is to construct 200,000 houses every year.\n\nMPs recently blocked a plan by the Treasury to open up affordable houses for open sale in the market, amid objection by Kenyans who sensed a plot to let non-deserving rich people end up being beneficiaries of the houses meant for low-earners.\n\nTreasury had in the Finance Bill, 2024, proposed to amend the Affordable Housing Act to remove a requirement that owners of affordable houses seek approval from the affordable housing board prior to sale of their houses.\n\nThis risked leaving the houses free-for-all and selling at market prices, despite having been built on the back of taxpayers\u2019 money so that they can specifically benefit low-earners.\n\n\u201cThe Committee noted that the current provision in the Affordable Housing Act limits the right to property as enshrined in the Constitution and would be subject to abuse and therefore recommended deletion of the clause,\u201d the National Assembly\u2019s Finance and Planning Committee stated.\n\nSection 54 of the Affordable Housing Act, 2024- which Treasury wanted to delete- states \u201cExcept with the prior written consent of the Board, a purchaser of an affordable housing unit under this Act shall not by contract, agreement or otherwise, sell or agree to sell his or her unit or any interest therein to any other person.\u201d\n\nFollowing the proposal by the Treasury, Kenyans petitioned parliament objecting to the move, arguing that it risked creating a loophole that would be exploited by rich, non-deserving persons to own the houses.\n\n\u201cRepealing the section that prohibits buyers from selling affordable houses will lead to speculative purchases by the wealthy and well-connected, thereby excluding the citizens who are intended to be the primary and sole beneficiaries of the programme,\u201d a petitioner Kevin Wanambisi said.",

Fourth generation (4G) on the other hand, expanded its regional coverage from 52 percent to 62 percent where Kenya and Rwanda again led the way with close to or exceeding 97 percent.\n\nAt the same time, mobile data prices in the region were found to have fallen significantly over the three years to last year, further accelerating the adoption of mobile services.\n\n\u201cThe influx of low-cost smartphones from Chinese manufacturers has made mobile phones more accessible to a wider population. Increased competition among mobile network operators and government interventions have also driven down data costs, making internet access more affordable.\u201d\n\nAccording to EACO, innovations such as Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa have partly contributed to the penetration growth due to their heavy reliance on mobile telephony services.\n\nThe report indicates that mobile money subscribers in the region stood at 128.7 million, reflecting a 64 percent penetration rate.\n\nIn Kenya, the latest Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) data shows that the total number of mobile phone devices connected to mobile networks stood at 65.7 million as of the end of March, translating to a 127.5 percent penetration rate.",

Thus no loss was suffered by him.\n\nOn his part, Mr Oshe argued that the appellants recklessly breached their fiduciary duty owed to him by irregularly enrolling him into a fraudulent insurance policy.\n\nHe further argued that the malicious manner in which the employee of the appellants enrolled him into a life policy insurance scheme and fraudulently executed contract documents to meet targets set (by the appellants) to bring profit to them (appellants), invited an award of exemplary damages.\n\nAt the magistrate\u2019s court, Mr Oshe had told the court that on or about June 4, 2020, the appellants through their staff, employee, and or agent unlawfully and fraudulently enrolled him into Absa\u2019s Life Insurance Protection Plan without his knowledge or consent.",

        "body": "Kenya has recently emerged as a beacon of civic and political activism, driven by a historic wave of protests addressing various social and economic grievances.\n\nThe powerful EndFemicideKe protests called for gender justice, while demonstrations against forced evictions and demolitions in informal settlements during the flood season highlighted the plight of marginalised communities. Yet, it is the widespread outrage over the contentious Finance Bill 2024 that truly galvanised the nation, drawing intense scrutiny and support both domestically and globally.\n\nThese protests have made history with their groundbreaking use of technology to rally and unite citizens beyond traditional tribal divisions.\n\nThe innovativeness, boldness, and resilience of Kenyan Gen Zs and millennials in activism tactics are noteworthy. Technology and social media played crucial roles in enabling broader participation in political discourse, increasing scrutiny of government actions, and empowering a demographic that challenged traditional power structures.\n\nScores of citizens voiced their frustration, anger, disappointment, opposition, and demands online and organised nationwide protests using hashtags like #EndFemicideKe, #TotalShutdownKenya, #RejectFinanceBill2024, and #OccupyParliament on social media platforms such as TikTok and X. Online petition platforms like Change.org (against the Finance Bill) and Avaaz.org (against femicide) were also used to rally public support.\n\nThe year began with massive demonstrations against femicide, driven by alarming statistics and a demand for stronger legal protections and enforcement. January and February saw some of the largest protests in Kenya\u2019s history, with women and allies marching to demand justice for victims and stricter laws to protect women.\n\nLed predominantly by young women and feminists, including many Nguvu Change Leaders playing different roles, these protests highlighted systemic gender-based violence and the need for legislative reforms to ensure the safety of women and equality.\n\nIn April, protests erupted over unfair demolitions and evictions following severe flooding, which disproportionately affected vulnerable communities. The evictions were deemed inhumane as many felt brutalised and were left without an alternative place to relocate to, no fair compensation, sufficient notice, or proper consultation.\n\nThese protests mark a turning point for Kenya, heralding a new era of collective action and political and social accountability in Kenya that has reshaped public discourse and policy direction.\n\nThey reflect deep-seated discontent and growing disillusionment among young Kenyans with existing policies that overlook public participation and fail to address urgent national issues. There is a demand for youth and women to have a meaningful role in shaping the future, not just demanding change but actively steering its course.\n\nThe government\u2019s response was criticised as selective and punitive, prompting calls for fairer environmental policies and better disaster management.\n\nThe most recent wave of protests has been driven by opposition to the Finance Bill 2024, which proposed significant tax hikes. These demonstrations, marked by a diverse demographic including millennials and mostly Gen Z participants, showcased widespread economic discontent.\n\nThe proposed tax increases were seen as burdensome, especially for the younger population struggling with unemployment and economic instability.\n\nThe outcome, which saw President Ruto conceding, underscores the growing influence of young people and women in national affairs, though their voices and concerns are often excluded from top decision-making. This has widened the gap between the government and disillusioned citizens who have lost faith and trust in leadership.\n\nIn supporting and amplifying these transformative movements, the younger generation and women, civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the government have pivotal roles to play. CSOs can provide the necessary organizational infrastructure, resources, and advocacy training to sustain the momentum of these protests, ensuring that young voices are heard and their demands are met.\n\nThe media, as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, can continue to spotlight these movements, foster informed debate, and hold those in power accountable. Meanwhile, the government must embrace a collaborative approach, engaging in constructive dialogue with these young activists and stakeholders to co-create policies and solutions that reflect the diverse interests of all Kenyans.\n\nTogether, these efforts can pave the way for long-term solutions, fostering a more equitable and just society where every Kenyan, especially the youth and women, can thrive and participate meaningfully in shaping the nation's future.",

Therefore, connect an ESG strategy to the broader goal of building a sustainable business that delivers returns for shareholders and wider stakeholder groups.\n\nIn recent months, some organisations have pulled back on their climate ambitions, including revising the climate or green targets they had set previously. For instance, we have seen some organisations push their net-zero target further, citing various challenges and complexities in their operating environment. Such moves do not instil confidence or build trust with stakeholders and society.\n\nOrganisations should take advantage of data and robust scenario planning before setting ESG or sustainability targets to reduce the likelihood of this occurring. Making informed decisions relies on using accurate and verifiable data. Therefore, organisations must ensure that green targets are set with comprehensive measurement, reporting, and verification of the underlying data to inform such decisions. For example, an organisation\u2019s net-zero target should only be set by management once it has measured, reported, and verified its emissions data and developed a strategy for managing the attendant risks and opportunities across its business.\n\nThe transition strategy is also where scenario planning should be applied. Organisations do not operate in a vacuum and constantly interact with their environment, both internally and externally.\n\nTherefore, in developing their transition strategy, it is pertinent to incorporate likely responses from internal and external relationships in their operating environment to build scenarios.

        "body": "The Kenyan online gambling market is experiencing a significant transformation with the integration of cryptocurrency. This trend is opening new opportunities for both players and operators. Understanding the dynamics behind this shift is crucial for staying ahead in the industry.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency in the online gambling sector has been nothing short of revolutionary. For many, the allure lies in the increased security and anonymity that digital currencies provide.\n\nAs a result, Kenya's online gambling market, projected to be significant with estimates suggesting a value close to $100 million in 2024, is poised to benefit from this growing trend.\n\nThe number of online gamblers in Kenya is also expected to rise, with Statista predicting 402,000 online sports betting users and 85,000 online casino users by 2029.\n\nHow cryptocurrency is reshaping the Kenyan gambling landscape\n\nCryptocurrency, with its decentralised nature, offers a level of transparency and security that traditional currencies struggle to match. For players in Kenya, this means safer transactions and lower risks of fraud. In the middle of this shift, you find the intriguing concept of a crypto casino, which blends modern digital currency with conventional gaming platforms.\n\nAdopting cryptocurrencies also means that transactions can be processed faster compared to traditional banking methods. This efficiency is particularly appealing to younger generations who are accustomed to the instant gratification provided by digital technologies. It is essential for operators to recognise this shift and adapt accordingly.\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrencies can help mitigate issues related to currency exchange rates and transaction fees, making it easier for international players to participate in Kenyan online casinos. This global reach not only broadens the player base but also increases revenue streams for operators willing to embrace these digital currencies. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies also aligns well with the increasing demand for provably fair gaming.\n\nBlockchain technology, which underpins most digital currencies, allows for transparent and tamper-proof record-keeping. This means that players can verify the fairness of games independently, fostering a sense of trust between the operator and the player. As more Kenyans become aware of these benefits, the adoption of cryptocurrency in online gambling is likely to accelerate.\n\nThe relevance of cryptocurrency in modern online casinos\n\nOne of the key benefits of integrating cryptocurrency into online gambling platforms is the enhanced privacy it offers users. For many Kenyan players, the ability to gamble without revealing personal banking information is a significant advantage. In addition, digital currencies often come with lower transaction fees, making them an economical option for frequent gamers. You can see this in action on platforms like Bombastic Casino which represents a dynamic and exuberant shift towards modern gaming solutions that cater to these financial advantages.\n\nAnother critical factor driving the adoption of cryptocurrency is its potential for reducing operational costs for casino operators. Lower transaction fees and faster processing times mean that casinos can operate more efficiently, potentially passing on these savings to their customers in the form of better odds or higher payouts.\n\nThis integration also opens up new marketing opportunities. By accepting cryptocurrencies, online casinos can appeal to a broader audience that includes tech-savvy individuals and early adopters of new technologies. This strategic move can significantly enhance customer loyalty and engagement, further driving growth in Kenya's already substantial online gambling market.\n\nThe use of cryptocurrencies also enables online casinos to offer a wider range of games and betting options. The fast transaction speeds and low fees associated with digital currencies make it feasible for operators to provide micro-betting opportunities and high-frequency games. This flexibility can be a significant draw for players looking for diverse and exciting gaming experiences, further boosting the appeal of Kenyan online casinos that adopt cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat players need to know about using cryptocurrency in gambling\n\nFor players considering using cryptocurrency at Kenyan online casinos, understanding how these digital currencies work is crucial. Consider the following:\n\nSafe Storage: Get a secure digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency safely. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption.\n\nGet a secure digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency safely. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption. Cryptocurrency Options: Find out which cryptocurrencies the casino accepts. Bitcoin is popular, but others like Ethereum and Litecoin are gaining traction. Each has its own benefits and transaction speeds.\n\nFind out which cryptocurrencies the casino accepts. Bitcoin is popular, but others like Ethereum and Litecoin are gaining traction. Each has its own benefits and transaction speeds. Market Volatility: Be aware that the value of cryptocurrency can change quickly. This can impact your winnings or losses. Stay informed about market trends to manage these risks.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency in Kenya's gambling industry\n\nThe integration of cryptocurrency into Kenya's online gambling market represents a significant step forward for the industry. As more operators adopt these digital currencies, it is likely that we will see continued growth and innovation within this sector. Players will benefit from increased security, privacy and convenience while enjoying their favourite games.\n\nMoreover, as regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate cryptocurrencies, we can expect a more structured and secure environment for all stakeholders involved. This evolution will be crucial in ensuring sustainable growth and maintaining player trust in the long run.",

        "body": "If you search for workouts tailored to different age groups on the internet, you will find an astonishing array of over a thousand variations. No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.\n\nWhile ageing is often linked with slowing down, older adults are challenging this stereotype.\n\nFred Oyugi, a personal trainer and CEO of Japesa Fitness and Adventure in Nairobi, says maintaining an active lifestyle is essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. Exercise, he notes, not only enhances physical health but also boosts mental well-being and emotional resilience.\n\nWhether it's taking a leisurely walk in the park or joining a dance class, there are countless ways to stay active and enjoy life to the fullest.\n\n\u201cWhile exercise types remain similar across ages, intensity and approach differ. At 60, gentler workouts are essential compared to the more vigorous routines suitable for 40-year-olds,\" he says.\n\nFor those in their 60s, light strength training and bodyweight exercises are crucial, he advises.\n\nRegardless of age, Fred stresses the importance of rest.\n\n\"Good training is three sessions a week. Rest is also a workout. Rest periods during workouts vary based on age and fitness level. For older women, longer rest periods of one to three minutes between exercises are essential to ensure they can perform the next set effectively without fatigue.\n\nFred notes that physical activity and regular exercise offer a multitude of benefits for seniors. These include increased energy levels, reduced risk or alleviation of chronic diseases, improved quality of sleep, decreased joint pain, stronger bones and muscles, and enhanced brain health and cognitive function.\n\n\u201cThese advantages underscore the importance of staying physically active as we age, promoting overall well-being and a higher quality of life,\u201d he underscores.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a back-squat exercise using the Smith Machine at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nMobility exercises\n\nAccording to the personal trainer, several highly effective mobility exercises tailored for seniors include gentle neck stretches that involve tilting the head left, right, forward, and backwards to alleviate tension in the neck and upper back.\n\nSeated leg lifts performed in a sturdy chair with feet placed flat on the floor help improve hip and thigh mobility by lifting one leg at a time and holding briefly before lowering.\n\nHip rotations, whether standing or sitting and using support as necessary, involve circular motions clockwise and counterclockwise to enhance hip mobility and reduce discomfort in the lower back.\n\nAdditionally, knee extensions done while seated in an upright position with feet flat on the floor strengthen the quadriceps and improve flexibility in the knees. These exercises are beneficial for seniors seeking to maintain or improve their mobility, contributing to overall physical well-being and quality of life.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a leg press at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nMuscle strengthening\n\nFurthermore, Fred highlights the effectiveness of bodyweight workouts for seniors, emphasising their ability to strengthen muscles without relying on external weights.\n\nHe notes that exercises like leg workouts can still be beneficial, acknowledging concerns about knee issues that might limit the use of weighted exercises, such as squats. Instead, focusing on bodyweight leg exercises can provide a safer alternative while still promoting strength and mobility in older adults.\n\n\u201cLeg workouts can be challenging for older persons due to knee issues, particularly when it comes to exercises like squats that involve weights. Older adults often already have knee problems, and performing squats with added weights can potentially exacerbate these issues and lead to injuries.\n\nHowever, leg workouts using just body weight can still be safely incorporated into their exercise routine. This approach allows for strengthening and conditioning the legs without putting undue strain on compromised joints, promoting fitness and mobility while minimising the risk of injury,\u201d he says.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a backstretch at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nOutdoor exercises\n\nThe gym isn't the only arena where his clients thrive; hiking and outdoor activities are integral to his holistic approach to fitness.\n\n\u201cFitness isn't just about the gym; it's about enjoying life and staying active. So what we do is we prepare them for life after retirement. Preparing mentally is as important as preparing physically,\" he stresses.\n\nThrough his guidance, older adults not only build muscle but also fortify their minds against the challenges that come with ageing.\n\nMinding the posture and diet\n\nPosture, another cornerstone of Fred's training, is emphasised to prevent injuries. \"A slight mistake in posture can lead to significant issues,\" he warns, underscoring the importance of proper form in every exercise.\n\nIn terms of diet, he advocates for a balanced approach. \"Exercise and diet go hand in hand,\" he asserts. \"What you eat affects how you perform and recover.\" He encourages his clients to adopt sustainable eating habits that complement their fitness goals.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a backstretch at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nFitness trend\n\nThe evolution of fitness demographics is evident to Fred. \"Gone are the days when gyms were dominated by the young,\" he observes. \"Nowadays, older adults are taking charge of their health.\" His clientele spans a wide age range, with individuals in their 80s embracing fitness as a lifestyle.\n\nOther workouts include shoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a slow, controlled manner to improve shoulder mobility and reduce stiffness.",

The UK\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May\u2019s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May\u2019s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers\u2019 input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland & Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London\u2019s junior stock market.

Photograph: Refinitiv Share\n\n2h ago 10.56 CEST On the French election, Swiss investment bank UBS said there is uncertainty over what will happen in the second round because of 250+ \u201ctriangular votes\u201d, with second rounds contested by three candidates. But the UBS analysts, led by Claudia Panseri, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management France, say that \u201cthe probability that no majority emerges from the election appears significant\u201d. (And on that basis they tell investors to avoid overreaction in the coming days.) The reach of the French far right will depend in part on whether other parties work together to stop them, UBS said: By 6pm on 2 July, the candidates will need to confirm if they want to enter the second round or withdraw and lend their support to another candidate. It will also be important to see whether the various parties will give explicit guidance to their voters on which candidate to vote for in the second round in constituencies where their own candidate fared less well. Gabriel Attal, France\u2019s prime minister, has called on members of his party who came in third to withdraw in favor of a \u201ccandidate who defends the values of the Republic\u201d. For now, the left is calling on its third-placed candidates to withdraw in order to defeat the RN. But either way, a \u201cperiod of political instability\u201d is very likely, they write in a note to clients. France\u2019s main stock index may have gained this morning, but UBS is cautious about the implications for company share prices, because uncertainty will be the name of the game for at least a week, and possibly longer. They wrote: The poor showing by Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance in the first round is likely to mean that French and Eurozone equities struggle to recover some of their recent losses. [\u2026] Fiscal worries will also likely remain until there is greater clarity after round two, preventing a larger rebound in stocks vulnerable to fiscal worries, such as financials and defense stocks. We expect European markets to stay volatile given there is still elevated uncertainty heading into the second round. Share\n\n2h ago 10.42 CEST UK mortgage approvals dipped slightly in May, but were right in line with expectations, according to new data from the Bank of England. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May, while approvals for remortgaging decreased slightly from 29,900 to 29,600 over the same period, the Bank said. Share\n\n3h ago 10.25 CEST Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German investment bank, said the French election result was \u201cnot worse than expected\u201d. Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) and its allies received 33% of the national popular vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front in second with 28%. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist bloc was third on 20% of the vote. Schmieding said RN\u2019s vote share was two points below opinion polling, meaning \u201ca hung parliament remains the most likely outcome\u201d. RN could still win an absolute majority in the second round on Sunday 7 July, but that \u201cnow looks even slightly less likely than it did before\u201d, he wrote in a note to clients. He also noted that the possibility that the leftwing coalition could \u201ctake power and implement its costly agenda seems to have receded further\u201d. (Investors have generally not been in favour of the potentially free-spending leftwing coalition.) Schmieding sketches out three scenarios (quoted here in full): Gridlock: The most likely outcome remains a hung parliament in which neither the far right nor the united left nor the Macron\u2019s centrists can muster a majority. In this case, any (new) government would not get much done. Worse than gridlock: Although the united left and RN are polar opposites on issues of migration, culture and identity, they have all opposed Macron\u2019s pro-growth reforms. As a result, we see a risk that Le Pen\u2019s party and parts of the left may still join forces in a hung parliament on a few select issues to soften Macron\u2019s pension reform and enhance the \u201cpurchasing power\u201d of citizens, for instance through lower VAT on energy products or via additional subsidies. Marine Meloni: With a significantly lower probability than the first two scenarios, Le Pen\u2019s party may still win a majority of seats and install RN boss Jordan Bardella as prime minister. If so, she would probably focus on winning the 2027 presidential election, staying on the more moderate track which she has signalled during the campaign. She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy\u2019s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time \u2013 or only if she became president in 2027. Schmieding sees \u201ca change for the worse\u201d after Macron\u2019s \u201cpro-growth economic reforms\u201d. He thinks they will mean higher spending relative to government income, plus a much more combative relationship with the EU. Share Updated at 10.28 CEST\n\n3h ago 10.10 CEST Back on the French election fall-out, let\u2019s look at what economists have had to say this morning. Marine Le Pen, leader of the victorious National Rally, formerly called for France to leave the euro currency and the EU. She has done her best to distance herself from any anti-euro sentiments in recent times, realising they are unpopular with people whose savings are in euros, but concerns over the future of Europe have been a major part of investor concerns over a far-right government. A hung parliament \u2013 as indicated by the first round of voting \u2013 would assuage some of those concerns. However, it could also stop Macron from making changes such as pension reforms that might boost economic growth, but which have proven unpopular with voters. Mohit Kumar, chief economist of Jefferies investment bank, said: The result is probably better-than-feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections. We could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process. However, any fears of Frexit or a euro area breakup would be unfounded. Share\n\n3h ago 10.07 CEST Two-year recession for European manufacturing sector Output from Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector dropped in June as Germany\u2019s economy continued to struggle, according to a closely followed index. That marked two years of contraction for the sector. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the eurozone dropped from 47.3 points in May to 45.8 in June, according to S&P Global. Germany\u2019s enormous manufacturing sector is usually the powerhouse of Europe, but it has now been in contractionary territory for two years, according to the PMI reading. The latest Germany reading for June came in at 43.5, a marked drop from May\u2019s 45.4 reading. That was marginally better than expectations, but remains well below the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: We are inclined to see this more as a temporary blip rather than a sign of a prolonged downturn. Manufacturing growth was seen in other parts of the world in June, such as the United States, UK, and India, according to their respective Flash PMI. This global recovery provides a supportive backdrop for Eurozone manufacturers. Additionally, optimism about future production remains as high as it was in May, indicating that businesses are still confident about the coming year.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images UK house prices rose by 1.5% in the year to June, a slight acceleration compared to 1.3% in the year to May, according to lender Nationwide. During June prices rose by 0.2% to an average of \u00a3266,604. The relatively slow pace of increases \u2013 certainly compared to the run of the last decade \u2013 is mostly down to higher interest rates, according to Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. He said: Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels. Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels. While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. The biggest price increases were in Northern Ireland, up 4.1% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Across England overall, prices were up 0.6% year-on-year, while Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% year-on-year rise. Prices fell 0.3% across southern England in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

Photograph: Mike Hutmacher/AP Boeing has bought supplier Spirit Aerosystems for $4.7bn, reversing a move 19 years ago to spin out the fuselage manufacturer. The US planemaker is taking control of Spirit in response to a series of manufacturing issues \u2013 including a blown-out door panel in January \u2013 that have plunged it back into crisis mode just as it thought it was emerging from the shadow of two crashes of its bestselling 737 Max jet. It may not be listed in France, but Toulouse-headquartered Airbus is another big gainer on stock markets this morning. The Amsterdam-listed planemaker may be benefiting from the broader rally, but its shares are up 2.8% after it said it will gain $559m (\u00a3441m) in compensation. Airbus will take over manufacturer of fuselage sections for the A350 jet in Kinston, North Carolina, and St Nazaire, France, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and of the A220\u2019s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun, who retires later this year, said: We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly. By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes \u2013 centered on safety and quality.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing\u2019s facility in Renton, Washington.\n\nThe deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes. Spirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005 but it still accounts for about 70% of all of its orders, with roughly 25% coming from Airbus \u2013 Boeing\u2019s arch-rival.\n\nThe Boeing president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said: \u201cBy reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes \u2013 centred on safety and quality.\u201d\n\nAirbus will take over the part of Spirit\u2019s business in Northern Ireland that makes wings and fuselage for its A220 jet. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest manufacturing employers, with about 3,500 staff across the country.\n\nAbout 40% of Spirit jobs in Northern Ireland are linked to production for companies including Bombardier and Rolls-Royce, and Airbus has said it will aim to sell some of these parts.\n\nBoeing will pay Airbus $559m in compensation to take over operations at four of its plants, including the plant in Belfast.\n\nThe total transaction value is about $8.3bn when Spirit\u2019s net debt is included, Boeing said.

        "title": "Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure",
        "body": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951.\n\nThe Guardian understands that a letter sent on Sunday afternoon by Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, has offered a new round of discussions about future investments at the company\u2019s plants in the UK, including Port Talbot.\n\nHowever, sources have said the offer to the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which represents all three unions at the site in south Wales, is predicated on unions agreeing to suspend any future industrial action.\n\nTata had originally planned to close the second of its two remaining blast furnaces at the end of September, while the process of shutting down the first is due to begin in the middle of this week. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.\n\nThe plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not \u201csafely and stably\u201d operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday 7 July.\n\nThe new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then. The Guardian understands the talks being offered would focus on future investments.\n\nCommenting on the letter, Alun Davies, national officer for Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said there were no fresh talks being proposed, and it simply reaffirmed Tata\u2019s position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting in May.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis position is that all unions will seek to conclude the negotiations on a memorandum of understanding and then put this to their members to decide whether it\u2019s good enough.\u201d\n\nHe added that the letter from Tata confirmed that all discussions would take place through the UK Steel Committee, which is chaired by Community\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss.\n\nUnite warned over the weekend that any closure would be \u201cirreversible\u201d and urged Tata not to \u201cabandon\u201d the workers employed at the plant.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe again call on the company to wait until we have a change of government, not make any irreversible decisions, and enter into meaningful negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was reportedly in talks with the unions and Tata last week in an effort to avert the early closure.\n\nThe first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, and the Welsh economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, said: \u201cThe news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces 4 and 5 at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community.\n\n\u201cThe Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Tata struck a controversial deal with the UK government, securing a \u00a3500m grant to build a greener \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace. However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.\n\nThe Labour party, widely expected to win a majority in Thursday\u2019s general election, has previously promised to invest \u00a33bn in the UK\u2019s steel industry in the next parliament, if elected. This would include the \u00a3500m already pledged to Port Talbot.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they are successful, Unite will reballot. We cannot allow these steel jobs to go.\u201d\n\nTata has previously said it is losing about \u00a31m each day keeping the remaining furnaces open.\n\nA Tata spokesperson said: \u201cIn the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site.\n\n\u201cThat is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\u201d",

Revenues increased from \u00a327.8m in 2022, to \u00a386.9m this year.\n\nIn May, the GMB union wrote to the chancellor warning that any decision to block the \u00a3200m loan guarantee that had been offered to Harland & Wolff would put jobs at threat.\n\nThe letter was prompted by reports that the government was looking to withdraw support for a \u00a3200m loan facility Harland & Wolff had applied for through UK Export Finance.

It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.\n\nAnalysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe conflict has ended Europe\u2019s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.\n\nEurope\u2019s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.\n\nSimon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers \u00a32,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.\n\nThe Horticultural Trade Association, which represents 1,400 garden retailers and growers in the UK, has joined forces with several European trade bodies to write an open letter to call for urgent solutions, warning the new system was adding more than 25% to import costs.\n\nIt said the checks introduced in April had held up a significant number of deliveries at the border, sometimes for as long as 44 hours, while difficulties carrying out inspections were increasing the chance of harmful pests and plant diseases entering Britain.\n\nThe new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports. Previously, plants were inspected in spot checks once they had reached nurseries.\n\nThe trade bodies said the new system is causing delays and piling on costs. One haulage company said it experienced 93 hours of driver waiting time in the first week of the checks, costing it \u00a338,000 in extra pay.\n\nThe company calculated that this would add \u00a31.5m to its logistics bill over the next year, an increase of 25%.\n\nAnother company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem. This resulted in the majority of plants dying or wilting and the loads being rejected by the end customer.\n\nThe letter was signed by International Flower Trade Association, whose membership accounts for 80% of the total value of worldwide trade of flowers and pot plants, as well as VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products.\n\nIt comes as importers are already having to deal with increased costs on moving plant and animal products to Britain because companies are now charged for inspections of goods at the border.\n\nThe letter said in some cases providers could be paying \u00a31,740 extra to bring in a mixed load of 12 different consignments of plants, making trade unviable for many small businesses.\n\nUnder the new Brexit rules, plants for planting have been categorised as high-risk, meaning much higher rates of inspection than for businesses that import meat and dairy, which are classified as medium risk.\n\nImporters claim the posts are too small to process goods from multiple lorries, and they said there is insufficient equipment at nearly all facilities to unload plants such as large trees or those large plants not stacked into plant trolleys.\n\nBefore the checks came in April, imported plants were held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before checks on site by government inspectors.\n\nUnder the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts. The government has insisted that this would enhance the country\u2019s biosecurity by stopping harmful diseases entering the country and damaging plants and crops.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The letter said: \u201cOlive trees are a well-known host for Xylella fastidiosa, a very high-risk and damaging bacterial disease.\n\n\u201cThe end customer would have expected and paid for the at-border check \u2026 Yet the business received no information about what had happened and why, nor was it aware that those trees had an incomplete check.\u201d\n\nThe government said it was working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly, while also publishing guidance on how to reduce delays for companies.\n\nIt added that checks were handled by fully trained staff to standard operating procedures ensuring inspections were undertaken safely.\n\nThe other signatories to the letter were the European Nurserystock Association, Royal Anthos (the Dutch Association for Nursery Stock and Flower Bulbs), VBN (the Dutch Flower Auctions Association) and Transport en Logistiek Nederland (the Dutch Transport & Logistics Association).",

        "body": "London\u2019s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.\n\nDemand for investment banking services \u2013 such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds \u2013 was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.\n\nBut the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,\u201d Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.\n\nThat is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of \u201cbulge bracket\u201d firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s more of a an upswing happening,\u201d the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. \u201cEven if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.\u201d\n\nNaidu said the UK\u2019s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. \u201cWhat might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.\u201d\n\nThere is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.\n\nDartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.\n\nWhile lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of \u00a344,267 in 2023 \u2013 marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier \u2013 mid-tier associates\u2019 bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to \u00a380,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to \u00a3213,940.\n\nMeanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to \u00a3135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to \u00a3303,204.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers \u2013 working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America \u2013 found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.\n\nBut even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There\u2019s no tennis on a dead planet.\u201d\n\nLindsay Grime, who created a spoof advert for the campaign that shows blood-stained cash flowing out of the pockets of a Wimbledon player, said the sponsorship deal is \u201cserving [Barclay\u2019s] mission to normalise what they do via a veneer of social acceptability\u201d, adding that \u201cWimbledon needs to wake up to the fact that Barclays is a totally toxic partner, sullying their tournament by association.\u201d\n\nBarclays is Europe\u2019s biggest fossil fuel financier, having invested $235bn (\u00a3186bn) since 2016. A report by the Campaign Against Arms Trade claimed the bank held about \u00a32bn in shares in eight companies that provide weapons, components and other military equipment to Israel.\n\nIn a statement posted online, Barclays addressed the criticism, saying it provided financial services to nine defence companies supplying Israel but did not \u201cmake investments for Barclays, and Barclays is not a \u2018shareholder\u2019 or \u2018investor\u2019\u201d. It added that the bank traded in shares of listed companies \u201cin response to client instruction or demand and that may result in us holding shares\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, a Barclays spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe are proud of our partnership with Wimbledon. Like many other banks, we provide financial services to companies supplying defence products to the UK, Nato and its allies. We are also financing an energy sector in transition, including providing $1tn of sustainable and transition finance by 2030 to build a cleaner and more secure energy system.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen In a protest against Barclays sponsorship of Wimbledon, activists have replaced commercial billboard, bus stop and tube ads surrounding the prestigious tennis tournament.

It is located at a service station at Rivington, on the M61 southbound about halfway between Manchester and Preston.\n\nChris Ashley, policy lead on environment and vehicles at the RHA, said action was needed. He said: \u201cAll the anxieties people have with cars, whether it\u2019s raining, whether the windscreen wipers or air conditioning are running, applies to trucks. It depends on the weather and the load.\n\n\u201cOn average, a good range for a diesel truck would be 600 miles, with caveats of course. That is why a public charging network is necessary, in our view,\u201d he said.\n\nResearch shows 70% of British electric trucks return to depots for recharging overnight, according to the RHA. Longer-haul journeys are impossible on batteries, which means most electric trucks are used for local deliveries within a 50- to 80-mile radius.\n\nThe size and weight of trucks means the distance they can achieve on a battery is a fraction of a car, just 200 miles.\n\nThe RHA is planning to submit 12 demands to the new government, with polls predicting a Labour win in this week\u2019s election.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Energy company Gridserve is leading a government-backed trial to roll out 200 chargers capable of delivering 350kW.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is momentum and [we\u2019ll] see decarbonisation start to snowball,\u201d said Ashley.\n\nThe current government plan is to phase out the sale of diesel and petrol HGVs of 26 tonnes or below by 2035 and the sale of all new HGVs heavier than that by 2040.\n\nThe Department for Transport had no comment ahead of the election.",

        "body": "America was meant to be Britain\u2019s route to the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.\n\nNow the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as \u201can act of arson\u201d.\n\nNearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.\n\nMany of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.\n\nBut more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jules Ehrhardt says \u2018collective centuries of institutional knowledge\u2019 have been lost. Photograph: Jesse Grant/Getty Images\n\nJules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was \u201coutrage and disbelief in the British business community\u201d at the decision.\n\n\u201cThey are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,\u201d he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.\n\nHe said the consulate directors had \u201cserved as the connective tissue\u201d between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. \u201cWe shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain\u2019s \u2018gateway to Europe\u2019 status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we\u2019ve self-elected a lobotomy,\u201d Ehrhardt said.\n\n\u201cThis [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.\u201d\n\nAllan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were \u201cabsolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey plug companies into a market they otherwise don\u2019t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US \u2018doing business\u2019 culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.\n\n\u201cMore than a million Brits are employed by American businesses \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It\u2019s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an \u201cAtlantic declaration\u201d with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.\n\nState-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.\u201d",

        "body": "Rishi Sunak abandoned his \u201clegacy\u201d policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.\n\nThe UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak\u2019s place in British political history.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK\u2019s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year.\n\nAfter months of fierce opposition from the industry \u2013 and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms \u2013 the proposal was excluded from the \u201cwash-up\u201d process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop.\n\nThe policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2008, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it.\n\nDocuments and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world\u2019s largest tobacco firms \u2013 the UK\u2019s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) \u2013 put ministers on notice of a legal backlash.\n\nImperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was \u201cunlawful\u201d because industry views had not been considered.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies.\n\nView image in fullscreen Imperial Brands sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK. Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nThe Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nImperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a \u201cjudicial review\u201d challenging the consultation process.\n\nGovernment lawyers responded by saying legal action might \u201cderail\u201d a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.\n\nBAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial\u2019s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.\n\nImperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was \u201ckeeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments\u201d.\n\nThe legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.\n\nPMI\u2019s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s UK subsidiary told the consultation it \u201cdid not support the age of sale ban as outlined\u201d, arguing instead for \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d on \u201ccombustible tobacco\u201d \u2013 ie cigarettes \u2013 instead of an outright ban.\n\nPMI told the Guardian the bill risked \u201cconfusing\u201d consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it \u201cfirmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK\u201d.\n\nBAT, which has previously advocated for a \u201csmokeless\u201d future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.\n\nAs the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a \u201cbusiness lunch\u201d with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company\u2019s annual party at the British Museum in London.\n\nIn May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak\u2019s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,\u201d JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment.\n\nOther MPs targeted by the tobacco industry included the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the \u201copen dismissal of industry views in the decision making process\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Illustration: Howard McWilliam\n\nBadenoch\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch\u2019s department to join Imperial in January.\n\nStafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a \u201clover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information\u201d.\n\nHe and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group\u2019s position in a speech.\n\nThe government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.\n\nIn total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.\n\nBAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: \u201cWe are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative party did not return requests for comment.",

        "body": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.\n\nAssuming the polls are right \u2013 and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign \u2013 the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.\n\nBut in 1906, Arthur Balfour\u2019s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.\n\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that\u2019s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.\n\nLiving standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income \u2013 a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account \u2013 rose by 2.4% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don\u2019t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.\n\nOnly twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.\n\nIn the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\n\nAs it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOther recent developments \u2013 especially those overseas \u2013 are not so welcome. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the first round of voting in France\u2019s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen\u2019s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government.\n\nEvents in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.\n\nGlobalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures \u2013 not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.\n\nThe developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.\n\nSo those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation \u2013 the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis \u2013 when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.\n\nAnd an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",

        "body": "Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.\n\nBut this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.\n\nMeanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain\u2019s tarmac.\n\nSo what might the election resolve \u2013 and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?\n\nThe culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2\n\nOne of Keir Starmer\u2019s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour \u201cthe only party on the side of drivers\u201d \u2013 a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for \u201cpeople\u2019s freedom to use their cars\u201d.\n\nThe Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.\n\nNow the party\u2019s manifesto highlights its \u201cbacking drivers bill\u201d in a chapter dedicated to \u201cstrengthening our communities\u201d, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) \u2013 an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government\u2019s own part in setting it up.\n\nThe rhetoric of ending a \u201cwar on motorists\u201d is shared in Reform UK\u2019s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.\n\nCampaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: \u201cWe\u2019re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist \u2013 we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.\u201d\n\nAnother headline Conservative promise is to \u201cstop road pricing\u201d, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer\u2019s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts \u2013 including motoring organisations \u2013 believe some such scheme eventually must come.\n\nBeyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform\u2019s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another \u00a325bn.\n\nAny mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour\u2019s manifesto, while the Conservatives\u2019 reiterates the derided \u201cNetwork North\u201d mixture of schemes funded by a putative \u00a336bn saving from axing HS2\u2019s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Liberal Democrat manifesto is the only one to propose reviving scrapped sections of the HS2 plans. Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nThe post-election action areas: rail reform \u2013 and potholes\n\nDespite the fate of the UK\u2019s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss J\u00fcrgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.\n\nBut the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour\u2019s manifesto puts it, \u201cthe potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule\u201d. The Tories have already earmarked \u00a38bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra \u00a365m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.\n\nA bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising \u201cthe biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties \u2013 partial renationalisation of rail \u2013 has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.\n\nWhoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway\u2019s structure and fares is promised. The \u201cguiding mind\u201d will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 \u2013 the worst performance in 19 years.\n\nA critical task will be to end the disruption from rail\u2019s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to \u201cend chaos\u201d suggests a possible reset.\n\nOff limits: road pricing and curbing flying\n\nThe vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about \u00a327bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.\n\n\u201cRoad pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,\u201d says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. \u201cPeople think \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up\u2019.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Campaign for Better Transport advocates a charge of 2p a km for electric cars. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy\n\nBarrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: \u201cThe dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car \u2013 but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?\u201d\n\nBut, he says: \u201cI would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn\u2019t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.\n\nTackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.",

        "body": "If Labour triumphs in this week\u2019s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds\u2019s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking \u2013 and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster.\n\nTo recap, Britain\u2019s biggest water company has been labouring under an \u00a318bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts.\n\nIn March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged \u00a3500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber.\n\nIts finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a \u00a3150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March \u2013 hours before investors pulled the plug \u2013 was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company\u2019s potential collapse high on the party\u2019s \u201crisk register\u201d after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall.\n\nOne of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat\u2019s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft \u201cprice review 24\u201d \u2013 the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years \u2013 on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak\u2019s soggy early election announcement.\n\nThames\u2019s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat\u2019s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra \u00a31.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the \u00a318.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households.\n\nInvestors will be combing Ofwat\u2019s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat\u2019s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nThe documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend \u00a396bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants.\n\nThames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames\u2019s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d statement, as last year\u2019s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July.\n\nInvestors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration \u2013 in effect a temporary renationalisation.\n\nA source close to Kemble\u2019s creditors said: \u201cObviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.\u201d\n\nThis week, Reynolds said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to see a nationalisation\u201d of Thames. \u201cI think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,\u201d he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be.\n\nUnfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.",

        "title": "Labour needs billions to fund its plans \u2013 and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton",
        "body": "Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things \u2013 nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head \u2013 have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.\n\nThe seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism\u2019s approach to wealth generation \u2013 trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly \u201ccrowds out\u201d suppressed investment and enterprise \u2013 is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off \u2013 and transforming Labour into Britain\u2019s natural party of government.\n\nHis first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not \u201ccrowd out\u201d investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while \u201ccrowding in\u201d innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices \u2013 the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.\n\nThis is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as \u00a3100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by \u00a3100bn every year \u2013 the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors \u2013 while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.\n\nOne important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the \u00a31.4tn funds fossilised in Britain\u2019s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers\u2019 final year\u2019s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a \u00a31.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks \u2013 and the money made to work to accelerate Britain\u2019s investment recovery.\n\nThere is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour\u2019s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth \u00a333bn with a \u00a312bn investment surplus \u2013 one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another \u00a3600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.\n\nThe first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least \u00a3100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves should lift the facility to \u00a350bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to \u00a310bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth \u2013 without additional direct government borrowing. It\u2019s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nAgainst this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK\u2019s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped \u00a328bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.\n\nIn the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves\u2019 Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.\n\nSome in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.",

        "title": "Housing: how 14 years of Tory rule have changed Britain \u2013 in charts",
        "body": "Ask a millennial in the UK in 2024 what distinguishes them from their parents\u2019 generation and it is likely that a single-word answer will crop up: housing.\n\nSince 2010, despite a succession of government pledges to would-be homeowners, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen. Meanwhile rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been repeatedly missed.\n\nHere, as part of our wider series on how 14 years of Conservative party rule has changed Britain, we look at some of the key datasets around housing.\n\nThis article necessarily focuses on England because many housing matters are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments.\n\nOwning a home has become harder Owning a home \u201chas got harder\u201d under the Conservatives. That\u2019s not a quote from a Labour party attack advert \u2013 but Rishi Sunak in a recent election interview with the BBC (he went on to say he would like to make it easier again). House price chart When David Cameron entered Downing Street two years after the 2008 house-price crash, the median house price in England stood at 6.9 times full-time employees\u2019 median annual earnings: in 2023, it was 8.3 times. London in particular has become much more unaffordable since 2010: the median property price was 12.7 times the median Londoner\u2019s earnings last September. It would be unfair to lay all of the blame for unaffordable housing at the door of the Tories \u2013 it has been two decades since a mid-range-price house in England was less than five times median household income (a different metric from the full-time-earnings ratio mentioned above) and prices rose much faster than income under New Labour. But \u2013 outside the 2008 housing bubble \u2013 the middle-earning household could still afford to buy a house in the cheapest 20% of the market. That changed in 2021 when official data confirmed that the middle classes were being squeezed yet further, with only the cheapest 10% of houses now affordable to the middle-earning household.\n\nRenting a home is more expensive Both prime ministerial candidates have said they want a younger generation to experience the feeling of getting the keys to their first flat. But house prices aren\u2019t the only blocker on home ownership because rents are increasingly eating into would-be-first-buyers\u2019 ability to save for a deposit. Rental price chart The Office for National Statistics\u2019 private rents index shows that renting in England is now 50% more expensive than 14 years ago, with the average rental price in London reaching a record level of \u00a32,035 a month in February 2024. The cost of renting has increased across all the regions, but there are differences. While the rise in London and the south-west has gone above 50%, average prices in the north-east have gone up by 28%. This data covers all rents and not newly advertised properties, which means that for those newly renting or moving from one rented dwelling into another costs have probably risen by even more.\n\nNot enough houses are being built Part of the reason for rising unaffordability \u2013 for buyers and renters \u2013 is a lack of supply. Housing target chart Successive governments have missed their building targets: David Cameron did not keep his promise of providing 200,000 new \u201cstarter homes\u201d \u2013 aimed at first-time buyers under the age of 40 \u2013 in 2015. The National Audit Office said that, by the end of 2019, no such homes have been built. Theresa May made housing one of her main domestic priorities, most significantly in her 2018 party conference speech, when she announced measures designed to allow councils to borrow more to build up to an estimated 10,000 more homes a year; a welcomed, if modest target which, again, wasn\u2019t met. Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 manifesto promised 300,000 new houses a year in England by the mid-2020s, although less than two years later, the then housing secretary Robert Jenrick admitted they would miss it by \u201ca country mile\u201d (the lastest figures show it\u2019s 22% below target). And where local authorities once provided a sizeable amount of newbuilds \u2013 which made up close to 40% of new builds in the 1970s, the private sector is now dominant. It has built more than 80% of new housing stock since 2019 with just 1% coming from local authorities (the balance comes from housing associations).\n\n\u201cAffordable\u201d rent has replaced social rent One of the early acts of the coalition government was the introduction of affordable rent \u2013 a new type of way to rent a property from a housing association with a monthly cost higher than social rent but lower than the market rate. It was introduced in 2011 as part of the government\u2019s austerity measures to help housing associations raise money after a huge cut to their funding. It has turned out to be affordable in name only in many parts of England and has all but killed off building for social rent. Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level. In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit \u00a389, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was \u00a3134. That\u2019s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine. And since the new type of rented housing was launched, the number of homes being built for social rent has plummeted. While 39,562 homes for social rent were completed in 2022/23, the last year for which data is available, there were 9,561 new homes at that rent level, while 24,303 were created for the more expensive affordable rent.",

Now TSB, one of the lenders that offers these deals, reports significant demand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone from a product we never really spoke about to something that regularly comes up. We\u2019re doing a steady number \u2026 there\u2019s a demand for it,\u201d says Roland McCormack, TSB\u2019s mortgage distribution director.\n\nFor tenants given the chance to buy this way, it may be the best financial deal they are ever offered. And while it involves a landlord agreeing to take a lower price than they could potentially get on the open market, it also means a quicker, smoother sale \u2013 and no estate agent fees.\n\nHow do they work, and who can get them?\n\nQuite a few banks and building societies offer mortgages that allow someone to buy a family member\u2019s property for less than its market value \u2013 for example, when a parent wants to help their child on to the property ladder, so agrees to sell at a discounted price.\n\nHowever, some lenders also accept mortgage applications from sitting tenants wanting to buy from their landlord, and from employees wanting to buy from their employer.\n\nThese are basically standard mortgages, but with one or two key differences.\n\nCrucially, the seller typically has to agree to sell for at least 10% below its market value. Many landlords might find that hard to swallow. However, the seller will enjoy cost savings that, it is claimed, could offset about half of that loss.\n\nIn many, but not all, cases, the tenant does not need to put down a penny of their own cash as a deposit \u2013 in mortgage-speak, the landlord is giving the tenant \u201ca gift of equity\u201d, which is taken by the lender as a deposit. Assuming a 10% discount, the buyer would then take out a 90% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage.\n\nHowever, the buyer may wish to put in some of their own money to boost the deposit and bring down the LTV, which hopefully will give them access to a better rate.\n\nThe discount has to be a gift, not a loan, with no conditions attached.\n\nThese deals are something of a niche product but are clearly enjoying a bit of a moment.\n\nView image in fullscreen Landlords who sell via a concessionary purchase do lose out on price, but benefit from a smooth, quick sale without estate agents\u2019 fees or the costs of having an empty property for months. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nWhich banks or lenders offer these deals?\n\nIn addition to TSB, there\u2019s the likes of Halifax, Nationwide, Barclays and NatWest.\n\nTerms can vary. For example, TSB and Nationwide are among those that explicitly state they do not require the tenant to put down any deposit. However, both Barclays and NatWest say buyers need to contribute their own deposit on top \u2013 a minimum of 5%.\n\nTypically, this is going to be an arrangement between a private landlord and tenant, though TSB and Halifax say the landlord can also be a local authority, indicating this could be an option for a council tenant where the right to buy is not available.\n\nWhy would a landlord agree to do this?\n\nA combination of a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let properties, and a string of mortgage-rate rises over the last two years, has led to many landlords baling out of the rented sector or evaluating their options. So there will definitely be some who are keen to sell.\n\nBy selling to their tenant, they avoid paying the costs normally associated with a house sale \u2013 notably estate agent fees, which can vary from less than 1% to as much as 3.5%. It also means they will not be paying perhaps several months of mortgage interest while the property is empty and on the market.\n\nMcCormack reckons those two savings will in effect cut the amount the landlord is giving away from 10% to more like 5%. \u201cThey are still out of pocket, but it\u2019s a much smoother transaction for them,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to have a tenant move out of the property, do it all up and then wait several months \u2013 all while not receiving rent.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the landlord does not have to bother finding a buyer and dealing with lots of inquiries about the property.\n\nOne of the key benefits for a landlord would be the speed of a sale, \u201cand, potentially, they don\u2019t want to do a disservice to a tenant who has perhaps been living there for a long time\u201d, says David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages. If the landlord has made a decent amount from the property and has a good relationship with the tenant, they may like the idea of helping them become a homeowner.\n\nIs this as good as it seems for the buyer?\n\nYes: they typically don\u2019t need a deposit and are saving at least 10% on the market value.\n\nAlso, they know the property and the area, says McCormack. \u201cThey know the heating works, they know the neighbourhood, they know the glitches and they know the neighbours.\u201d\n\nA landlord\u2019s \u00a331,000 \u2018gift\u2019\n\nFirst-time buyers Graham and Lisa received a huge financial helping hand to get on the housing ladder in the form of a \u00a331,000 equity \u201cgift\u201d from their landlord to buy the home they had been living in for over three years.\n\nThey started renting the two-bedroom bungalow near Cheltenham in late 2019, and then, early last year, the landlord said he was looking to sell.\n\nThe couple, who had been thinking of trying to buy the property, spoke to a mortgage adviser who suggested a TSB concessionary purchase mortgage.\n\nThe couple made sure the terms were OK with the landlord \u2013 in particular, the 10% discount. He agreed, and they went ahead.\n\nThe house had a market value of \u00a3310,000. Once the \u00a331,000 discount was applied, they required a \u00a3279,000 loan.\n\n\u201cWe put in another \u00a320K, so the deposit was \u00a351,000,\u201d says Graham, 32. That meant they were able to take out a mortgage (a five-year fix) for \u00a3259,000.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the easiest way we could have got on the ladder,\u201d says Graham, a production engineer working in aerospace. The couple did not need to move or compete with other buyers or \u201cdeal with any of the really difficult parts of housebuying\u201d.\n\nThey are paying more monthly than they were when they were renting. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s into a mortgage, and the property is ours. Of course, we\u2019ve got \u00a330K of equity we did not pay for,\u201d says Graham.",

When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.\n\nThey asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.\n\nAXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.\n\nST, Gloucester\n\nThe premium package you purchased promised \u201cunforgettable seats\u201d along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. \u201cUnforgettable\u201d, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.\n\nAE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over \u00a31,320 for two.\n\nFeedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.\n\n\u201cFrom the row we\u2019ve been allocated, it looks as though we\u2019ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold \u2013 with a view of the stage \u2013 but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.\u201d\n\nOther furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.\n\nSeats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it\u2019s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.\n\nNeither AXS nor its sister \u00adcompany AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don\u2019t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.\n\nST\u2019s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.\n\nAE\u2019s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. \u201cIf the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,\u201d he says. \u201cA cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.\u201d\n\nOn the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk.

        "body": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.\n\nRecent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.\n\nAndresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.\n\n\u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An earnings limit means you do not qualify for carer\u2019s allowance if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week. Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy\n\nWith just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.\n\nCarer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.\n\nCarers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.\n\nThose who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nCarers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen A recent survey found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with the cost of living. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\n\u201cRemoving unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,\u201d Walker says.\n\nShe says the low level of the payments doesn\u2019t recognise what carers do, \u201cand there are clear problems in the way that it\u2019s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d\n\nStephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d\n\nAmong proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.\n\nWalker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d",

        "body": "Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.\n\nWhile students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.\n\nThe UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university\u2019s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.\n\nStudent accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.\n\nMegan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: \u201cStudents become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.\n\n\u201cFor example, if a student\u2019s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThis only applies to final-year students; students don\u2019t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.\u201d\n\nManchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.\n\nA spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: \u201cIt\u2019s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.\u201d\n\nCouncil tax bills are based on a property\u2019s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.\n\nAccording to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between \u00a368,001 and \u00a388,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be \u00a32,171 a year. This is about \u00a3181 a month \u2013 a lot when a third of students live off less than \u00a350.\n\nStudents who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.\n\nThere can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.\n\nStudents who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council\u2019s discretion.\n\nHowever, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.\n\nIt is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.",

        "body": "UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.\n\nA number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.\n\nHowever, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.\n\nMark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThis is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.\u201d\n\nLucinda O\u2019Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: \u201cNow is the time to act, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs.\n\nMany of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.\n\nAt the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.\n\nThese require a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires \u00a310,000 to open an account.\n\nHowever, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d.\n\nThis is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively.\n\nOther providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d\n\nIt is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.\n\nLoyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.",

Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of \u00a3100 \u2013 reduced to \u00a360 if paid within 14 days.\n\nHowever, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.\n\nThe AA\u2019s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: \u201cThis self-authored code doesn\u2019t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees \u2026 These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.\u201d\n\nThe code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.\n\nIt also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an \u201cappeals charter\u201d for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.\n\nParking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.\n\nPoliticians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses \u2013 which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year \u2013 for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.\n\nA bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to \u00a350, among a number of other measures.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.\n\nI see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging \u00a340 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.\n\nML, by email\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.\n\nIt is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge \u2013 one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.\n\nI asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.\n\n\u201cThe fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWith reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.\u201d\n\nIf everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this \u00a340 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body": "Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections.\n\nAgust\u00edn Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a \u201csmooth landing\u201d from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.\n\nGlobal government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.\n\nEmmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country\u2019s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nPolls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.\n\nCarstens said the BIS was not calling out any \u201cone or two\u201d governments but that the message was clear.\n\n\u201cThey [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a solid foundation to build upon.\u201d\n\nWith interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.\n\n\u201cThey can surprise you with not much notice,\u201d Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain\u2019s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. \u201cYou really want to avoid that.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.\n\nIf it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.\n\nThe turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?",
        "body": "Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you\u2019ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data \u2013 GDP, jobs, etc \u2013 and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nUniform patches\n\nOne known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there\u2019s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s underwear\n\nAsk any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.\n\nLipstick\n\nFor the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.\n\nOverseas freight\n\nWorld shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They\u2019re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.\n\nI\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.\n\nGoofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.",

        "body": "Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.\n\n\u201cMy friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.\u201d\n\nVanessa\u2019s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the \u201cplummeting mental health of young people\u201d, she says. \u201cPut these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.\u201d\n\nHer decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.\n\nThese factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\n\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.\n\nHere we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.\n\nHow the UK is affected\n\nThe total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAs a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the \u201creplacement rate\u201d, often known as the \u201cR-rate\u201d, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.\n\nIt has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.\n\nAnn Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: \u201cThe Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.\u201d\n\nThe trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.\n\nThis figure is not an all-time low because the UK\u2019s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.\n\nBut when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.\n\nAccording to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday \u2013 the first generation for which that is true.\n\nIt\u2019s the economy \u2026\n\nWhen the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.\n\nHannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.\n\nChildcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. \u201cThe family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.\u201d She and her partner are considering moving abroad.\n\nIn the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries \u2013 under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France \u2013 arrested declines over previous decades.\n\nIn the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK \u2019s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.\n\nFor all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cIn other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.\u201d\n\nTo measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fiona Powley, a trainer and facilitator who runs Bristol Childfree Women.\n\nThe consultancy\u2019s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.\n\n\u2026 but also other factors\n\nRecent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.\n\nBerrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty in the answers\u201d. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.\n\nFiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, \u201cthey talk about time and freedom: finances don\u2019t usually feature\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cA common judgment from others asks \u2018who will look after you when you\u2019re old?\u2019, to which most members might say they\u2019ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they\u2019ve not have the financial strain of children.\u201d\n\nSarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\n\n\u201cThese days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and \u2018I\u2019m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down\u2019,\u201d says Harper, who advised the David Cameron\u2019s government on the implications of an ageing society.\n\nPublic services\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.\n\nIn a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, \u201cthe size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,\u201d it said.\n\nAt the moment, the UK population is increasing \u2013 by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years \u2013 but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.\n\nWithout a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.\n\nSchools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to \u00a31bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.\n\nAccording to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.\n\nPrimary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.\n\nPupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.\n\nLooking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.\n\nWhat about ageing?\n\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?\n\nNik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.\n\n\u201cOne way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio \u2013 the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.\u201d\n\nJust as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.\n\nHarper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.\n\n\u201cMen in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,\u201d she says. \u201cMen who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won\u2019t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.\u201d\n\nHarper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.\n\nGiven that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people\u2019s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.\n\nBerrington says the implications for policymaking are \u201cvery significant \u2013 for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. \u201cPolicy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.\u201d\n\nPronatalist policies \u2013 those that attempt to boost the birthrate \u2013 are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.\n\nA report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. \u201cWe do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct \u2018population strategy\u2019 to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,\u201d it said.\n\nBerrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cAnd governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons \u2013 poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children \u2013 have relatively high inactivity rates.\u201d",

More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip \u2013 employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment \u2013 are popular with the public.\n\nRecent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one \u2013 including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.\n\nTwo things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un\u00adable to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic \u00a316 a week higher than in 2010 \u2013 despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d) under successive Conservative governments.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers \u2013 a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the \u00adsupport for public sector strikes last year.\n\nIt is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.\n\nFrom \u201cself-employed\u201d gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people\u2019s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.\n\nIn theory, Labour\u2019s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.\n\nSocial care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of \u201cfair pay agreements\u201d under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.\n\nUnions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership \u2013 something the GMB has only just won at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of \u201cworker\u201d, which comes with more obligations than rights.\n\nAs with so many areas of Labour\u2019s agenda, however, the details will be critical \u2013 as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.\n\nRegulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better\n\nBut Soames\u2019s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers \u2013 with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.\n\nThe necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour\u2019s plan to win Thursday\u2019s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?\n\nRegulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.",

Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.\n\nThe data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.\n\nReal household disposable income \u2013 how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation \u2013 is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.\n\nThe strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.\n\nRishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable income per head \u2013 were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.\n\nDespite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person \u00a3120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.\n\nAdam Corlett, the thinktank\u2019s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.\n\nThe UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.\n\nHowever, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning \u2013 bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years.

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.\n\nI hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",
        "summary": "Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\nBritain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error.\nAnd suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\nBut right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",

        "body": "Labour would rather have stability in the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU\u2019s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.\n\nAddressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been \u201cvery difficult for businesses\u201d because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.\n\nWith less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.\n\nSome business leaders and economists have said Labour\u2019s hopes to grow the economy \u2013 and thereby pay for improved public services \u2013 could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.\n\n\u201cYou could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.\u201d\n\nKemi Badenoch, Reynolds\u2019s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the \u201cpower of business to do good\u201d.\n\nHowever, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on \u201cmy favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics\u201d.\n\nBadenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy \u2013 an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May \u2013 was \u201cmorally repellent\u201d and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to \u201censhrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people\u201d as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.\n\nShevaun Haviland, the BCC\u2019s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d and try to improve the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that \u201cbusinesses don\u2019t want a renegotiation\u201d.\n\nAmanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that \u201can air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy\u201d and that some of the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.\n\nLabour\u2019s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party\u2019s relationship with business was \u201cone of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019\u201d.\n\nHe was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour\u2019s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told by some commentators they don\u2019t think Labour\u2019s campaign is exciting enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, my friends, we\u2019re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we\u2019re not putting on politics as entertainment.\u201d",

        "body": "Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK\u2019s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nOfficials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said.\n\nBut it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.\n\n\u201cPolicy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,\u201d the Bank\u2019s financial stability report said. Questions over a country\u2019s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was \u201crelevant to UK financial stability\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.\n\nThat includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.\n\nIn total, about 3 million \u2013 or 35% \u2013 of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders \u2013 including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level \u2013 could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.\n\nThere are also concerns about the financial system\u2019s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.\n\n\u201cAlthough the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,\u201d the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.\n\nPolicymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK\u2019s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and \u201csevere\u201d economic shocks.\n\nThe first \u2013 a \u201csupply-shock scenario\u201d echoing the ripple effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.\n\nThe second \u201cdemand-shock scenario\u201d \u2013 which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns \u2013 assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.\n\nThis year\u2019s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank of England will not release bank-by-bank results but will issue an aggregate report by the end of the year.",

        "title": "Labour\u2019s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation",
        "body": "As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss\u2019s government and its \u201cdash for growth\u201d in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.\n\nBuoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.\n\nIn short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy\u2019s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.\n\nThere is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.\n\nThe Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.\n\nLabour has indicated it would try to \u201chardwire\u201d many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt \u201crule\u201d as the current Conservative party.\n\nThe challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.\n\nOne must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nAnother, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country\u2019s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM\u2019s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around \u00a3176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world\u2019s biggest coal shipper, is \u201cphasing down\u201d its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. \u2018Largest ever\u2019 NSW coalmine plan will put pressure on state\u2019s net zero target, watchdog says Read more Legal & General says: \u201cLGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.\u201d LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company\u2019s shares.

As flagged this morning, Daniel Kretinsky\u2019s EP Group set out its plans for the future of Royal Mail\u2019s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), in a letter sent to shareholders. In the offer letter, EP Group said it is \u201cexploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business\u201d which could include \u201cprofit-sharing\u201d among all members of staff.

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. Shares in Rivian\u2019s stock have jumped by 30% in early New York trading, from $11.96 to $15.47, following yesterday\u2019s announcement.

Today\u2019s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share\n\n5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says \u201cthe recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected\u201d in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain\u2019s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect \u201crobust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation\u201d, Gruenwald explains. Share\n\n5d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached \u201cthe beginning of the end-game\u201d, as some \u2013 such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank \u2013 have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is \u201cjust the flipside\u201d of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want?

Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to \u201cplunder\u201d the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without \u201cany prospect\u201d of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the \u201copportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could\u201d, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell \u201cshould make the payments\u201d set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include \u00a321.5m for a wrongful trading claim, \u00a317.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least \u00a350m.

The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI\u2019s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj \u2014 CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below \u201caverage\u201d for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).\n\nOrders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: \u201cLast month\u2019s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it\u2019s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it\u2019s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK\u2019s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.\u201d Share\n\n5d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX\u2019s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of \u201cmaterial Scope 3 emissions\u201d that fail to account for its material value chains\u2019 emissions. Today\u2019s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM\u2019s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this \u201cstewardship\u201d of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.\u201d Share",

The company has pledged to pay the living wage to employees.\n\nAn analysis by Universal, produced in line with Treasury guidelines on economic appraisal, estimates the resort would bring in nearly \u00a350bn of economic benefits to the UK.\n\nThe net economic contribution is forecast to be \u00a335.1bn during construction and the first 20 years of operation. It would generate up to \u00a314.1bn in additional tax returns over the same period, the study said.\n\nUniversal is still conducting due diligence and expects to decide on the project by the end of the year.\n\nThe new park, which would take five to six years to build, would be constructed on the site of Kempston Hardwick brickworks, once the world\u2019s largest brickworks, which shut in 2008 and was demolished in September 2021.\n\nThe company said 92% of 6,000 people surveyed during a four-week public engagement period in May supported the theme park. It said it had \u201cbeen delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.\n\nDr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as \u201ca new climate and human health threat\u201d and urged air freight companies to \u201cend their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail\u201d.\n\nAir freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.\n\nThe researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon\u2019s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.\n\nThe researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.\n\nThe report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.\n\nBy 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.\n\nFedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry\u2019s carbon emissions in 2023. It is estimated that 99.8% of aviation fuel is produced from fossil fuels, with the scaling of low carbon replacements a distant prospect.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.\n\nOn one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.\n\nThis increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\n\nAlarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.\n\nAlthough the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThese measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration\u2019s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe new US tariffs could extend beyond China\u2019s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.\n\nTo be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies \u2013 often in the form of cheap credit \u2013 have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.\n\nAdmittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.\n\nWith US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition \u2013 if we were to embrace it.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. He served as a member of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\n\u00a9 Project Syndicate",

        "body": "A human rights group has urged Britain\u2019s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein\u2019s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein\u2019s cotton suppliers in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.\n\nRepresented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that \u201cany attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused\u201d.\n\nThe China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (\u00a352bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein\u2019s potential London listing would be a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: \u201cShein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company\u2019s supply chains.\n\nThe group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK\u2019s convention obligations, it said.\n\n\u201cThe FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: \u201cStop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn\u2019t the place to come for a \u2018no questions asked\u2019 approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange\u2019s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein\u2019s supply chains.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign group\u2019s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the \u201caccuracy of its published modern slavery statement\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnder the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.\n\nBefore a company\u2019s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company\u2019s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA\u2019s role to independently verify the accurate of information.\n\nMichael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: \u201cA firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.\u201d",

The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: \u201cConfidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that\u2019s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.\u201d \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude01Americans are feeling confident!

Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates \u2013 which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals \u2013 appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Not a surprise in the least.

It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around \u00a350bn. This would be London\u2019s biggest ever float. Shein wins Labour support as it prepares \u00a350bn London listing Read more But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. \u201cWhere SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN\u2019s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. \u201cRewarding SHEIN\u2019s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable \u2013 which cheapens us all. \u201cIt is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.\u201d Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. \u2018Worst of the worst\u2019: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show?

In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding.

        "body": "From 24 Jun 2024 09.50 CEST Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules Newsflash: Brussels has accused Apple of restricting competition on its app store. European commissioner Thierry Breton has announced that the EU will take action against Apple under its new digital regulations, the Digital Markets Act. Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\n\n\n\nToday we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore & iOS comply with the DMA. \u201cAct different\u201d should be their new slogan\ud83c\udf4f\n\n\n\nFor too long @Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\n\n\n\nToday we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore & iOS comply with #DMA pic.twitter.com/e741oV9r9l \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) June 24, 2024 The EU are also investigating whether Apple\u2019s developer fees breached the bloc\u2019s rules, the Financial Times reports, adding: As part of the new probe into developer fees, Brussels said it was looking at whether Apple was imposing too many restrictions for users to download and install alternative app stores. Share\n\n7d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. \u201cIt\u2019s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then\u201d, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. \u201cWe don\u2019t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,\u201d Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally\u2026 Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests\u2019 leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is \u201cvery much focused\u201d on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a \u201cquite exceptional\u201d job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month\u2019s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now \u201cterrified\u201d at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was \u201cno better job\u201d than Business and Trade Secretary, which \u201cis a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister\u201d. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats\u2026 would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before\u2026. That doesn\u2019t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid\u2026 and appears to leave the door open for one\u2026. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d situation; she doesn\u2019t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its \u00a315.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK\u2019s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share\n\n7d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer\u2026]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the \u201chighest standards\u201d on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers\u2019 homes, meaning they fall below the \u00a3135 threshold for import duty \u201cThat could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,\u201d Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share\n\n7d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What\u2019s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an \u201cobvious place to look for that\u201d money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and \u2018make the case\u2019 for investing in Britain. \u2018It won\u2019t take as long as people think\u2019: Rachel Reeves on being \u2018scrappy\u2019 \u2013 and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour\u2019s plans come from the \u201creasonable complaints\u201d of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn\u2019t know the country\u2019s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. \u201cWe will look again\u201d at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers \u2013 that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money\u2026. Share\n\n7d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven\u2019t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share\n\n7d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union \u2013 starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that \u2018relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they\u2019re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won\u2019t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don\u2019t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn\u2019t accept it. She insists the UK can\u2019t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share\n\n7d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it\u2019s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. \u201cThose are facts\u201d. Well\u2026.. this thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.\n\nWe'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.\n\nIt's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\nActually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that \"leapfrogging\" notion is wrong.\n\nIf anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.\n\nRaising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?\n\nBrexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.\n\nIf u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.\n\nFilm I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.\n\nEven tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest \"exports\" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.\n\nThe @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.\n\nAnd this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.\n\nAre we still in fourth place?\n\nIn short: no.\n\nLook, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.\n\nIn fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015. Which is consistent with other datapoints. pic.twitter.com/POeOJU04pf \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Share\n\n7d ago 14.53 CEST Reynolds: Need to escape low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop Next issue \u2013 fiscal issues, and the IMF\u2019s warning that both major parties\u2019 manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum\u2026. Kemi Badenoch says she \u201ccompletely disagrees\u201d with IFS\u2019s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS\u2019s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS\u2026. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don\u2019t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says \u2013 and that\u2019s Labour\u2019s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won\u2019t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that\u2019s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government\u2019s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share\n\n7d ago 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour\u2019s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour\u2019s manifesto is \u201ca pro-worker, pro-business\u201d agenda, that \u2013 he says \u2013 has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that \u201cThe floor will rise\u201d, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it\u2019s businesses don\u2019t want these measures. She claims it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour\u2019s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are \u201cterrible regulations\u201d. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn\u2019t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won\u2019t accept this, telling business leaders they should be \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of \u201csurrendering\u201d your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are \u201cfishing in an empty barrel\u201d, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Share Updated at 14.52 CEST\n\n7d ago 14.25 CEST Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change\u2026 \u2026and blames Liz Truss\u2019s \u201cdisastrous mini-budget\u201d for forcing Labour to drop its \u00a328bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak\u2019s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a \u201cshort-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership\u201d, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate. Share",

It added that it would then look to raise a further \u00a3120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.",

        "body": "As the latest reduction in the energy price cap takes effect, households are being warned of a big lift in bills ahead due to higher wholesale gas prices.\n\nThe cap, which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy, fell by 7% overnight in the wake of the latest three-month review by industry regulator Ofgem.\n\nThe reduction meant that typical 12-month bills will be around \u00a3500 cheaper than a year ago.\n\nIt left the average bill at \u00a31,568 - a figure that will apply until the result of the next review takes effect in October.\n\nHowever, a report by the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said on Monday that consumers should brace for an additional hit of up to \u00a3600 over the coming winter, largely due to higher wholesale prices.\n\nIt pointed to a possible \u00a3200 price cap hike from October on the back of some analyst calculations, suggesting it was plausible the total could remain around that level until June.\n\nOne calculation, by experts at Cornwall Insight and released on Friday, predicted a 10% - or \u00a3155 - increase from 1 October to \u00a31,723 a year but said there remained uncertainty on the market path ahead.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:31 Party energy plans compared\n\nConsumer groups say there is an alternative to the price cap, pointing to a growing number of fixed-rate deals on the market following a dearth of competition in recent years.\n\nEuropean wholesale costs are again elevated for the time of year based on pre-energy shock norms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent pressures have included strong competition from Asia, particularly China, for liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\nThat has replaced some of the Russian natural gas volumes that were stripped away in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nA planned extension of the European Union's sanctions regime against Russia will see its LNG exports targeted for the first time - potentially placing further pressure on supply across the continent.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Unions say it's workers' jobs\n\nMuch of the debate has centred on costs but the impact of gas use in particular has fuelled argument too on the UK's climate commitments.\n\nDr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at ECIU, said: \"The UK's high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers \u00a32,000 so far during the gas crisis and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.\n\n\"Common sense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets.\n\n\"North Sea gas output is declining so unless we make the switch we'll be ever more dependent on foreign imports.\n\n\"The maths is clear, when it comes to energy independence, new drilling licences are a side show making a marginal difference compared to the immense quantity of homegrown energy that offshore wind and other renewables can generate.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nEU sanctions on Russian LNG could have gone much further\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nEmily Seymour, the editor of Which?

        "title": "General Election 2024: Five things the main parties aren't talking about this election",
        "body": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says there's a conspiracy of silence at this election - that all of the major political parties aren't being honest enough about their fiscal plans.\n\nAnd it has a point. Most obviously (and this is the main thing the IFS is complaining about) none of the major manifestos - from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative parties - have been clear about how they will fill an impending black hole in the government's spending plans.\n\nNo need to go into all the gritty details, but the overarching point is that all government spending plans include some broad assumptions about how much spending (and for that matter, taxes and economic growth) will grow in the coming years. Economists call this the \"baseline\".\n\nBut there's a problem with this baseline - it assumes quite a slow increase in overall government spending in the next four years, an average of about 1 per cent a year after accounting for inflation. Which doesn't sound too bad - except that we all know from experience that NHS spending always grows more quickly than that, and that 1% needs to accommodate all sorts of other promises, like increasing schools and defence spending and so on.\n\nImage: NHS spending grows more quickly than the 'baseline'\n\nIf all those bits of government are going to consume quite a lot of that extra money (far more than a 1% increase, certainly) then other bits of government won't get as much. In fact, the IFS reckons those other bits of government - from the Home Office to the legal system - will face annual cuts of 3.5 per cent. In other words, it's austerity all over again.\n\nBut here's the genius thing (for the politicians, at least). While they have to set a baseline, to make all their other sums add up, the dysfunctional nature of the way government sets its spending budgets means it only has to fill in the small print about which department gets what when it does a spending review. And that spending review isn't due until after the election.\n\nThe upshot is all the parties can pretend they've signed up to the baseline even when it's patently obvious that more money will be needed for those unprotected departments (or else it's a return to austerity).\n\nSo yes, the IFS is right: the numbers in each manifesto, including Labour's, are massively overshadowed by this other bigger conspiracy of silence.\n\nBut I would argue that actually the conspiracy of silence goes even deeper. Because it's not just fiscal baselines we're not talking about enough. Consider five other issues none of the major parties are confronting (when I say major parties, in this case I'm talking about the Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem manifestos - to some extent the Green and Reform manifestos are somewhat less guilty of these particular sins, even if they commit others).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nTaxes going up\n\nFirst, for all their promises not to raise any of the major tax rates (something Labour, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have all committed to) the reality is taxes are going up. We will all be paying more in taxes by the end of the parliament compared with today.\n\nIndeed, we'll all be paying more income tax. Except that we'll be paying more of it because we'll be paying tax on more of our income - that's the inexorable logic of freezing the thresholds at which you start paying certain rates of tax (which is what this government has done - and none of the other parties say they'll reverse).\n\nSecond, the main parties might say they believe in different things, but they all seem to believe in one particular offbeat religion: the magic tax avoidance money tree. All three of these manifestos assume they will make enormous sums - more, actually, than from any single other money-raising measure - from tightening up tax avoidance rules.\n\nWhile it's perfectly plausible that you could raise at least some money from clamping down on tax avoidance, it's hardly a slam-dunk. That this is the centrepiece of each party's money-raising efforts says a lot. And, another thing that's often glossed over: raising more money this way will also raise the tax burden.\n\nImage: Should the Bank of England be paying large sums in interest to banks? File pic: AP\n\nThird is another thing all the parties agree on and are desperate not to question: the fiscal rules. The government has a set of rules requiring it to keep borrowing and (more importantly given where the numbers are right now) total debt down to a certain level.\n\nBut here's the thing. These rules are not god-given. They are not necessarily even all that good. The debt rule is utterly gameable. It hasn't stopped the Conservatives from raising the national debt to the highest level in decades. And it's not altogether clear the particular measure of debt being used (net debt excluding Bank of England interventions) is even the right one.\n\nWhich raises another micro-conspiracy. Of all the parties at this election, the only one talking about whether the Bank of England should really be paying large sums in interest to banks as it winds up its quantitative easing programme is the Reform Party. This policy, first posited by a left-wing thinktank (the New Economics Foundation), is something many economists are discussing. It's something the Labour Party will quite plausibly carry out to raise some extra money if it gets elected. But no one wants to discuss it. Odd.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBrexit impact\n\nAnyway, the fourth issue everyone seems to have agreed not to discuss is, you've guessed it, Brexit. While the 2019 election was all about Brexit, this one, by contrast, has barely featured the B word. Perhaps you're relieved. For a lot of people we've talked so much about Brexit over the past decade or so that, frankly, we need a bit of a break. That's certainly what the main parties seem to have concluded.\n\nBut while the impact of leaving the European Union is often overstated (no, it's not responsible for every one of our economic problems) it's far from irrelevant to our economic plight. And where we go with our economic neighbours is a non-trivial issue in the future.\n\nAnyway, this brings us to the fifth and final thing no one is talking about. The fact that pretty much all the guff spouted on the campaign trail is completely dwarfed by bigger international issues they seem reluctant or ill-equipped to discuss. Take the example of China and electric cars.\n\nImage: Brexit has barely featured in the election. File pic: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nJust recently, both the US and European Union have announced large tariffs on the import of Chinese EVs. Now, in America's case those tariffs are primarily performative (the country imports only a tiny quantity of Chinese EVs). But in Europe's case, Chinese EVs are a very substantial part of the market - same for the UK.\n\nRaising the question: what is the UK going to do? You could make a strong case for saying Britain should be emulating the EU and US, in an effort to protect the domestic car market. After all, failing to impose tariffs will mean this country will have a tidal wave of cars coming from China (especially since they can no longer go to the rest of the continent without facing tariffs) which will make it even harder for domestic carmakers to compete. And they're already struggling to compete.\n\nBy the same token, imposing tariffs will mean the cost of those cheap Chinese-made cars (think: MGs, most Teslas and all those newfangled BYDs and so on) will go up. A lot. Is this really the right moment to impose those extra costs on consumers?\n\nIn short, this is quite a big issue. Yet it hasn't come up as a big issue in this campaign - which is madness. But then you could say the same thing about, say, the broader race for minerals, about net zero policy more widely and about how we're going to go about tightening up sanctions on Russia to make them more effective.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Enormous gaps. The \"conspiracy of silence\" goes way, way beyond the stuff the IFS has talked about.\n\nBut 'twas ever thus.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy the US is imposing 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars\n\nRapid steps needed for Britain to compete in green revolution\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThink back to the last time a political party actually confronted some long-standing issues no one wanted to talk about in their manifesto. I'm talking about the 2017 Conservative manifesto, which pledged to resolve the mess of social care in this country, once and for all.\n\nIt sought to confront a big social issue, intergenerational inequality, in so doing ensuring younger people wouldn't have to subsidise the elderly.\n\nThe manifesto was an absolute, abject, electoral disaster. It was largely responsible for Theresa May's slide in the polls from a 20-point lead to a hung parliament.\n\nAnd while most people don't talk about that manifesto anymore, make no mistake: today's political strategists won't forget it in a hurry. Hence why this year's campaign and this year's major manifestos are so thin.\n\nElections are rarely won on policy proposals. But they are sometimes lost on them.",

        "body": "It is the first big moment of election night. The exit poll is the moment millions tune in for a first sniff of the eventual result of the general election.\n\nAnd in Election 2024 this poll, with its impressive track record, sometimes down to a margin of only a few seats, will, once again, be a key part of broadcasters' coverage - including here at Sky News - on Thursday night.\n\nThe current model was devised in 2005 by Professor John Curtice and statistician David Firth and it has been consistently reliable, bar 2015 when the seat numbers suggested a hung parliament and David Cameron scraped a thin majority.\n\nBut for the most part, its accuracy has been dependable. In 2010, it correctly predicted the exact number of seats for the Conservatives.\n\nCommissioned by the broadcasters - Sky News, the BBC and ITV News - the fieldwork is carried out by IPSOS UK who will have interviewers at 133 polling stations around the country this year.\n\nPeople who have just voted will be asked to privately fill in a replica ballot paper and place it into a ballot box as they leave their local community centre, church hall or station.\n\nMichael Clemence, from IPSOS UK, says this and the scale are part of what distinguishes the exit poll from the many surveys that have come before it.\n\nImage: Exit pollsters will be at 133 locations this year. Pic: Reuters\n\n\"We're going to be doing over 17,000 interviews on the day. And also we're dealing with people's behaviour. So we're not asking people how they intend to vote.\n\n\"We're talking to electors who just voted. And I'm asking exactly what they just did. So you've cut out the error in prediction polling.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers can only deploy to a fraction of the total constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, so locations are chosen to best reflect the demographics of the country with an urban and rural spread.\n\nHowever, many of the locations will be in marginal seats, where the swing between the main parties will be tracked.\n\nThe same polling stations are targeted year after year so the swing from the last election's exit poll, along with other data at constituency level, can be analysed by those crunching the numbers.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

        "body": "Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.\n\nSky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.\n\nCity sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.\n\nMoney blog: How to split housework fairly\n\nThese are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.\n\nAn outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.\n\nOVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.\n\nUnder Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.\n\nOVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.\n\nImage: Stephen Fitzpatrick launched OVO in 2009. Pic: OVO\n\nIn recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.\n\nIn May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.\n\nMr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.\n\nHe is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nFour major banks hit by glitches\n\nExit from recession stronger than first thought\n\nEx-Fujitsu engineer denies 'protecting the monster'\n\nKey to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.\n\nOVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (\u00a3395m) valuation.\n\nKaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.\n\nOVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.\n\nIn 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of \u00a31.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.\n\nIt said this had \"no cash impact\" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nLast summer, the company announced a \u00a3200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.\n\nOther investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.\n\nMayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.\n\nThis weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.\n\nLike its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.\n\nLast month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of \u00a3122, to \u00a31568.\n\nOther big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over \u00a37bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.\n\nCentrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of \u00a37.3bn.\n\nOVO, whose valuation in any major transaction was unclear this weekend, declined to comment.",

I believe that I told the truth as I understood it at the time.\"\n\n\"You were a Fujitsu man doing what Fujitsu needed you to do to protect the monster,\" Ms Page put to him.\n\nMr Jenkins said: \"I didn't think it was a monster.\"\n\nDuring his evidence, Mr Jenkins has said he was sorry for what happened to Mrs Misra.\n\nShe told Sky News on Tuesday that she would not accept that apology.",

        "title": "DXJ: Benefiting From The Weak Yen, So Far",
        "body": "thitivong\n\nI clearly remember the amount of excitement around the long-awaited rally in Japanese equities at the beginning of the year. However, just a few more months have shown that the Japanese stock market is facing growing challenges.\n\nForeign investors tend to leave the Japanese equities due to concerns around the Japanese economy and currency. With the yen hitting new lows relative to the US dollar, currency-hedged exchange-traded funds like the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:DXJ) have become an especially relevant option.\n\nEven though the DXJ ETF helps to mitigate the risk of the further weakening of the Japanese yen, it is still exposed to structural issues in the Japanese economy. I give the DXJ ETF a \"Hold\" rating and would recommend investors in Japanese equities exercise caution.\n\nDXJ ETF Overview\n\nAccording to the prospectus, the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund ETF is a passively managed ETF that seeks to track the performance of the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index. The DXJ ETF seeks to provide Japanese equity returns while mitigating or \u201chedging\u201d against fluctuations between the value of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. For reference, currency hedging is a strategy designed to manage currency risk through forward contracts or FX options.\n\nThe DXJ ETF holdings structure consists of Japanese dividend-paying companies, primarily exporters. The sector composition is rather diversified, with a primary focus on companies from the industrial, consumer discretionary, and financial sectors.\n\nWidsomTree\n\nCompared to peer Japan ETFs, the DXJ is an absolute winner if we're talking about a time horizon longer than 3-6 months. There's a clear trend that non-hedged ETFs like the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) demonstrate radically inferior returns.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe long-term performance of the DXJ ETF, amid a continuously declining Japanese yen relative to the US dollar, emphasizes how useful currency-hedged ETFs can be for investors.\n\nWhat's The Bull Case For Japanese Equities?\n\nThe overview of the Japanese stock market made by abrdn investment company is probably one of the most concise and informative pieces on the topic. Let me summarize the key bullish points related to Japanese equities:\n\nJapanese stock market is large but still hugely underanalyzed, offering the potential for hidden value;\n\nPlenty of Japanese companies have strong fundamentals, balance sheets, and cash flows;\n\nJapan's still moderate inflation positions Japanese businesses well compared to other major economies;\n\nLong-term structural themes like robotics, energy transition, and digitization may support the growth of Japanese equities in the future;\n\nAll of these points sound pretty good, at least as long as we don't dive too deep into macroeconomics surrounding the Japanese equities. Macro is the place where things get really complicated for Japan.\n\nBank of Japan Is Locked In A Tricky Macro Landscape\n\nOver the last several decades of economic stagnation, Japan has accumulated a lot of debt. In the G7, Japan is the most indebted country of the group, with the percentage of government debt to GDP exceeding 260%, by some estimates.\n\nNikkei Asia\n\nJapan's economy is heavily dependent on rising debt that helps the government to temporarily mask the structural issues (like the aging population) and the lack of long-term economic drivers.\n\nThe debt \"elephant in the room\" can't be ignored because of the several reasons:\n\nDue to the extremely high government debt load, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is very limited in its ability to raise interest rates. The current interest rate in Japan is 0-0.1%, which is nowhere near the US Fed Funds rate of 5.25-5.50%. Such a huge difference between rates puts the BoJ in a vulnerable position in terms of monetary flexibility. If the BoJ raises rates, the government's budget will face a dramatic increase in interest payments to maintain debt, and Japan will be at risk of slipping into a deflation spiral again. At the same time, the inability to raise interest rates is especially important amid the steadily weakening Japanese yen and the BoJ has few monetary tools to stop the excessive decline of the yen. When the yen weakens too much, the BoJ has to resort to direct FX interventions that demonstrate diminishing efficiency over time.\n\nFor me, such a macroeconomic setup is very far from being a sustainable one over the long term. Some may argue that the United States themselves are on the same debt trajectory. Nonetheless, the US, as well as the EU countries, are noticeably far from the same level of debt Japan currently has.\n\nUp until recently, the weak yen has been a boon for Nikkei 225, the main Japanese stock index. However, in June, the correlation between Japanese equities and the yen turned negative.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWeekly net flows show a continuous outflow for the fifth straight week, though the magnitude of outflows is much smaller than it was, for example, in March 2023.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe thing is, the yen exchange rate climbed back above 160 per the US dollar, which is a sign of the uncomfortable weakness of the Japanese currency. The FX market completely absorbed the $62 billion intervention from the Bank of Japan just in a couple of months, when the USD/JPY rate was temporarily brought down from 160 to 152.\n\nPrevious interventions of comparable volume were effective for around a year, and the Powell's \"pivot\" in the end of 2023 really helped the Japanese currency. Now, given that the Fed sticks to the \"higher for longer\" approach, the yen lacks tailwinds that could help it to stay afloat without falling too much.\n\nEven worse, revised data showed that Japan's GDP declined by 1.8% in Q1 2024, with weak consumption as a key source of concern.\n\nBloomberg\n\nTo be completely fair, Bloomberg specifies that the Q1 GDP was affected by one-off factors: a New Year\u2019s Day earthquake northwest of Tokyo and an auto production halt due to a certification scandal. The Q2 GDP numbers are expected to be much better and will be published in August, which may be a local turning point for Japanese equities.\n\nIn the following weeks, I expect the Nikkei to continue lagging behind its peer stock indexes because of the weakening of the yen and sluggish economic growth.\n\nBloomberg\n\nTo sum up, the current BoJ's approach to monetary policy can be described as \"spray with liquidity and pray the Fed turns dovish soon enough to avoid rate hikes\". Given that we may be probably on the brink of the second inflation wave in the mid-2020s, any rate cuts from the Fed in the foreseeable future may not stay for long. Therefore, the longer-term macroeconomic landscape for Japan looks unfavorable, with the Bank of Japan basically being at the mercy of the US Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI prefer to hold a constructive and unbiased view of Japanese equities. If the Fed somehow manages to successfully execute a widely anticipated \"soft landing\" of the US economy, then rate cuts in the US can lead to another wave of growth in Japanese equities, in my view.\n\nThe DXJ ETF does a spectacular job of insulating investors from currency-related risks, effectively benefiting from the collapsing yen. However, the excessively weak yen combined with weak economic data may still weigh down on investors' sentiment. Thus, I'd personally avoid investing in Japanese stocks, at least until the economic outlook improves.",

(00:24) Boeing (BA) agrees to Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) takeover for $37.25 a share. (01:05) EU to charge Meta over \u2018pay or consent\u2019 model - report. (02:04)\n\nThis is an abridged transcript of the podcast.\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said Sunday night it has agreed to acquire U.K. private markets data provider Preqin for \u00a32.55B (~$3.2B) in cash.\n\nBlackRock says this will add a highly complementary data business to its investment technology.\n\nIn 2024, Preqin is expected to generate ~$240M of highly recurring revenue and has grown ~20% annually in the last three years.\n\nThe deal is BlackRock's (BLK) second major acquisition this year to expand into the fast-growing world of private markets investing.\n\nIn January, BlackRock said it would buy Global Infrastructure Partners for ~$12.5B.\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) has agreed to acquire Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) for $37.25 a share in an all-stock deal.\n\nThe two companies shared the news shortly after midnight in separate news releases.\n\nThe deal values Spirit at more than ~$4.7B billion, Boeing said. Including debt, the total transaction value is ~$8.3B.\n\nSpirit said that it entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE (OTCPK:EADSF) that calls for the companies to enter into agreements for Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) to acquire some Spirit assets that support Airbus programs, along with the closing of its acquisition by Boeing.\n\nThe acquisition would effectively reverse Boeing's spinoff of Spirit in 2005 as a separate publicly traded company. At that time, Boeing (BA) had sought to cut costs by outsourcing the assembly of fuselages and other parts.\n\nThe EU is set to charge Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with violating the Digital Markets Act.\n\nIn March, the European Commission launched a non-compliance investigation against Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google and Meta Platforms (META) for potential violations under the Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe Financial Times is reporting, citing three people with direct knowledge of the matter, that in preliminary findings to be issued this week, regulators will say that they are worried about Meta's \"pay or consent\" model.\n\nMeta (META) introduced a no-ads subscription service for Facebook and Instagram in Europe late last year to comply with the evolving European regulations, enabling users to opt out of the company\u2019s data tracking for advertising purposes. Meanwhile, users who consent to be tracked get a free service.\n\nAccording to the FT report, the regulators are expected to say that the choice presented by Meta\u2019s model risks giving consumers a false alternative, with the financial barrier potentially forcing them to consent to their personal data being tracked for advertising purposes.\n\nThe report concluded that if found in breach of the act, Meta (META) faces hefty penalties of up to 10% of its global turnover, and up to 20% for any repeat offense.\n\nThe report comes after EU antitrust regulators last week pressed a similar case against Apple (AAPL). The European Commission said that Apple's App Store rules breach the DMA as they prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.\n\nMore articles on Seeking Alpha:\n\nSurveillance network: FedEx, retailers said to be sharing AI camera feeds with cops\n\nRising drug costs force a third of Americans to leave prescriptions unfilled: report\n\nA second Trump administration may be more lenient towards antitrust enforcement - JPMorgan\n\nCatalyst watch:\n\nThe FTC will hold a closed door meeting. There is some chatter that the topic could be the planned Tempur Sealy (TPX)-Mattress Firm (MFRM) merger.\n\nKORE Group (KORE) will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis following the company's 1-for-5 reverse stock split.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the markets as of 6 am. Ahead of the opening bell today, Dow, S&P and Nasdaq futures are in mixed territory. Crude oil is up 0.4% at $81 per barrel. Bitcoin is up 2.3% at $62,000.\n\nIn the world markets, the FTSE 100 is up 0.2% and the DAX is up 0.2%. The markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.\n\nThe biggest movers for the day premarket: Li Auto's (NASDAQ:LI) shares rose more than 3% after announcing the delivery of 47,774 vehicles in June, a 46.7% increase Y/Y and 36.4% M/M.\n\nOn today\u2019s economic calendar:",

        "body": "sankai/E+ via Getty Images\n\nIn our previous analysis of United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC), we analyzed the company\u2019s revenue growth outlook based on demand (end-markets) and supply (wafer production and ASP), anticipating single-digit revenue growth of around 9% through 2023 driven by its automotive segment growth.\n\nSince our previous analysis, the company\u2019s revenue declined by 20% in 2023 which was well below our previous expectations. We reexamined the company to determine whether the company is on track to return to positive growth in 2024 and beyond, as analyst consensuses for this year at 1.5% and rising to 15% in 2025. For our analysis, we analyzed factors such as the company\u2019s competitive positioning in the foundry market, its 12nm process technology advancements, and new capacity expansions to determine whether these could support its growth recovery. Based on this, we then revised our revenue projections and valuation of the company.\n\nAnticipated Market Recovery\n\nFirstly, we analyzed the impact of its exposure to the overall foundry market and each of its customers\u2019 end market breakdown on its growth outlook. We analyzed the company\u2019s market share in the foundry market below.\n\nTrendForce, Company Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nIn 2023, the company\u2019s total revenue declined by 20%. However, its market share remained fairly stable compared to 2022 at 6.1%. Therefore, this indicates the company\u2019s performance was affected primarily by external factors rather than internal factors. This is as the foundry market declined by 15% in 2023. In our previous analysis, we highlighted the foundry market attributable to end market weaknesses as the PC, smartphone, automotive and server end markets contracted. We further examined its revenue breakdown by end markets below to analyze its performance by end market from its annual reports.\n\nFoundry Segment Sales by Application ($ mln) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Average Computer 527 592 653 791 693 880 1,306 1,360 797 Growth % -25.3% 12.4% 10.3% 21.0% -12.3% 27.1% 48.3% 4.2% -41.4% 4.9% Communication 2,372 2,414 2,462 2,224 2,574 3,270 3,533 4,080 3,262 Growth % 5.4% 1.8% 2.0% -9.7% 15.8% 27.1% 8.0% 15.5% -20.0% 5.1% Consumer 1,230 1,230 1,457 1,433 1,287 1,509 2,074 2,357 1,740 Growth % -3.9% 0.0% 18.5% -1.7% -10.2% 17.3% 37.4% 13.7% -26.2% 5.0% Others 264 319 452 494 396 629 768 1,269 1,450 Growth % 49.4% 21.0% 41.8% 9.3% -19.9% 58.8% 22.1% 65.3% 14.2% 29.1% Total 4,392 4,555 5,025 4,941 4,950 6,289 7,680 9,066 7,249 Growth % -0.4% 3.7% 10.3% -1.7% 0.2% 27.1% 22.1% 18.1% -20.0% 6.6% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nFrom the table above, we can see that the company\u2019s 3 main segments experienced declines in revenues in 2023. Communications remained its largest segment (45% of revenues) but declined by 20% in 2023, followed by Consumer and Computer which declined by 26.2% and 41.4% respectively. Overall, all 3 of its main segments had the worst performance in 2023 over the period. However, its Others segment revenue had positive growth during the year which includes its automotive business following its new agreement with DENSO (OTCPK:DNZOF) for power semiconductors.\n\nNotwithstanding, we expect the company\u2019s end market demand could improve this year amid the recovery in end markets. Furthermore, in its latest earnings briefing, management mentioned they \u201cexpect to see an increase in wafer shipments as the inventory situation in the computing, consumer, and communication segment improves to a healthier level\u201d.\n\nOverall, we attribute the company\u2019s growth performance in 2023 to the overall foundry market weakness. However, we expect the company to capitalize on a potential end market recovery in the Computer segment with the ongoing recovery in the PC market, Communications with new 5G technologies, and stabilizing demand in its Consumer segment while automotive could continue to pose headwinds in 2024 amid the elevated automaker chip inventories. In our previous analysis, we highlighted our projection for the PC market shipments to rebound by 11.5% in 2023 as we estimate excess shipments to be absorbed. Furthermore, we believe the smartphone market continues to mature and projected a forecast growth rate of -2.7%. However, we expect 5G could be a driver as it recently launched its new \u201c3D IC solution for RFSOI\u201d for RF 5G technologies. In Consumer, the company expects shipments to continue improving in the next quarter after its improving Q1 performance which indicates signs of recovery, which may bode well for the company as the consumer electronics market has a forecast CAGR of 3%. Additionally, while Others which includes automotive grew positively in 2023, we expect its performance in the near term in 2024 to remain challenging as we highlighted the excess chip inventory levels of automakers and only expect the situation to improve in the H2 2024.\n\nRanking TSMC (TSM) SMIC Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) GlobalFoundries (GFS) UMC (UMC) Process Technology 1 3 2 4 5 Customer Partnerships 1 4 2 5 3 AI Factor 1 5 2 3 5 Average 1.00 4.00 2.00 4.00 4.33 Factor Score 1.50 0.75 1.25 0.75 0.67 Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Khaveen Investments\n\nIn our previous analysis of TSMC, we derived a competitive factor score of 0.67x for UMC as it trails behind competitors such as TSMC, SMIC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries in analyzed metrics such as Process Technology, Customer Partnerships and AI Factor as we determined the company faced stronger competition in advanced process technology and AI partnerships. We factored this (0.67x) with our expected long-term foundry market growth rate of 12.3% and projected UMC\u2019s demand growth of 8.2%. Historically, UMC also underperformed the foundry market growth rate and gradually saw its market share decrease as seen in the chart above, thus we believe our projections are in line with its historical performance.\n\nUMC Demand Projections ($ mln) 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F 2028F Revenue (Demand) 7,249 7,846 8,493 9,193 9,951 10,771 Growth % 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% Foundry Market Growth 117,409 131,851 148,068 166,281 186,733 209,702 Growth % -16.7% 12.30% 12.30% 12.30% 12.30% 12.30% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Khaveen Investments\n\nProcess Technology Advancement\n\nIn 2024, the company announced a partnership with Intel for collaboration in the development of 12nm process technologies. As part of the partnership, the company plans to introduce its 12nm process technology in 2027 leveraging Intel\u2019s manufacturing facilities in the US. Thus, we examine the drivers behind the shift of the semicon industry to the 12nm process technology advancement and the rate of its adoption.\n\nCompany Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the company\u2019s most advanced process technology tops out at 14nm, with the 14nm to 28nm category accounting for 33% of its revenue in Q1 2024. Therefore, the development of 12nm would represent a further advancement in the company\u2019s current process technology capabilities. However, UMC would still trail behind top foundry competitors which has advanced process nodes (generally 7nm and below), thus UMC would still lag behind competitors.\n\nCompany Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nTSMC Revenue by Process Nodes 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Average TSMC Mature Total 90% 80% 70% 59% 50% 47% 42% 12/16nm share of Mature 24% 26% 29% 29% 28% 28% 24% 28% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nReferring to the revenue breakdown of TSMC by process technology, TSMC\u2019s 12nm is included as a part of its 16nm family (16/12nm Technology). Its revenue figures are highly stable over the period, as the decrease in the share is mainly due to the rise in the revenue contribution of its advanced nodes below 7nm. We calculated its 12nm/16nm share of total mature % which shows a 7-year average of 28%, which we assume as our proxy as the maximum share of mix for 12nm for UMC. UMC\u2019s 14nm was introduced in 2017, thus the gap between that and its planned introduction of 12nm is 11 years, which we assume will take UMC to reach our proxy share mix estimate of 28% (2037).\n\nMacro Hive\n\nIn our previous analysis of UMC, we highlighted IC Insights forecast of monthly capacity share of 10nm to 20nm to decrease through 2024 (38.8% to 26.2%) as the share of advanced node capacity increases. We also highlighted that 10 to 22nm process nodes are utilized by Logic and Memory submarkets with a share breakdown of 21% and 79% respectively, indicating the usage primarily among memory and logic chips. Memory chips such as DRAM with DDR5 \u201care generally manufactured using technology sizes of 10nm or 12nm\u201d, rather than advanced nodes which we believe could be due to the higher cost sensitivity of memory chipmakers as it is a commoditized market and had a slower adoption of EUV compared to logic chipmakers. In logic chips, 12nm is still used for chips including CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, AI accelerators and ASICs but these chips also utilize the most advanced nodes such as 5nm for enhanced performance as seen in the chart above. However, 12nm is also used in IoT applications where the chips desired are low-powered MCUs and connectivity ICs as well as sensors. Therefore, we believe UMC\u2019s demand for 12nm would be dependent on logic and memory chipmakers. We estimated based on SEMI\u2019s breakdown of process nodes by Logic, Memory and DAO with UMC\u2019s revenue breakdown by process node in 2024 Q1, with Logic and Memory accounting for the largest % of the company\u2019s revenue. Our estimated breakdown shows UMC\u2019s Logic and Memory market segments as the two highest accounting for a total of 78%, which we believe bodes well for its 12nm outlook as we highlighted its primary adoption in low-powered logic and memory semiconductors.\n\nMarket Breakdown Logic Memory DAO UMC 33.8% 44.0% 22.0% Market Breakdown 39% 32% 29% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: SEMI, Khaveen Investments\n\nOverall, we believe UMC\u2019s expansion into 12nm with its partnership could support a growth outlook. However, it is only expected to have an impact on its revenue mix in the long term as it will only be introduced in 2027. That said, we believe 12nm process technology could remain a positive prospect for the company as it is still utilized in memory chips and several logic chips for low-powered IoT applications. For example, the company has highlighted in its earnings briefing that it is focusing on 12nm development and pointed out \u201ca high-level of interest\u201d from customers including working with customers for RAM. Furthermore, we estimated that memory accounts for the largest segment of the company, which bodes well for the shift to 12nm. Additionally, UMC was reported to be discussing long-term partnerships with Texas Instruments (TXN) and Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNY), two key players in the MCU market.\n\nCapacity Expansion and Utilization\n\nFinally, we examined the company\u2019s expansion plans and determined how its future capacity expansion plans could support its supply growth to meet demand growth. Based on its latest earnings briefing, management guided its capex for this year to be $3.3 bln. The company also recently highlighted its Singapore expansion plans which we covered previously valued at $5 bln remaining on track as its \u201cphase 3 expansion at its Fab12i in Singapore\u201d received new equipment tools in May 2024. Despite that, beyond 2024, management cited in the earnings briefing that it expects capex to peak in 2024, which indicates potential lower capex next year.\n\nAnnual Capacity 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Average Yearly Utilization Rate 89% 88% 94% 93% 88% 97% 104% 99% 68% Total Annual Capacity (12K equiv) 2,941 3,104 3,246 3,410 3,621 4,083 4,201 4,458 4,674 Growth % 4.6% 5.5% 4.6% 5.1% 6.2% 12.7% 2.9% 6.1% 4.8% Wafer Shipments 2,608 2,743 3,038 3,160 3,195 3,961 4,383 4,420 3,195 Growth % 5.2% 5.2% 10.8% 4.0% 1.1% 24.0% 10.7% 0.9% -27.7% Wafer ASP 1,684 1,661 1,654 1,564 1,549 1,588 1,752 2,051 2,269 Growth % -5.4% -1.4% -0.4% -5.4% -0.9% 2.5% 10.4% 17.1% 10.6% Revenue 4,392 4,555 5,025 4,941 4,950 6,289 7,680 9,066 7,249 Growth % -0.4% 3.7% 10.3% -1.7% 0.2% 27.1% 22.1% 18.1% -20.0% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nHowever, when we further examined the company\u2019s wafer capacity and shipment growth along with its capacity utilization, we found that the company\u2019s utilization rate had fallen sharply in 2023 to 68% compared to almost full utilization in 2022. Wafer shipments declined by 27.7% during the year while the company guided 2024 wafer shipments to increase by a \u201clow single-digit percentage\u201d and utilization rate of 60%.\n\nAdditionally, wafer shipments declined by 27.7% in 2023 but the company\u2019s ASPs increased by 10.6%. This is despite reports of the company offering discounts in 2023. Instead, one factor for the pricing increase could be due to the change in its revenue mix as revenue share for 14nm to 28nm, its current most advanced process technology category had increased to 31% from 24% in the prior year.\n\nSupply Forecasts 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026 2027F 2028F Capex ($ mln) 1,732 2,607 2,980 3,300 3,300 3,300 3,300 3,572 Growth % 84.8% 50.5% 14.3% 10.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Capacity Increase 118 257 216 263.1 263.1 263.1 263.1 284.8 Capacity Increase Per Capex 0.068 0.099 0.072 0.080 0.080 0.080 0.080 0.080 Total Annual Capacity (12K equiv) 4,201 4,458 4,674 4,937 5,200 5,463 5,727 6,011 Growth % 2.9% 6.1% 4.8% 5.6% 5.3% 5.1% 4.8% 5.0% Average Yearly Utilization Rate 104% 99% 68% 65% 71% 78% 84% 91% Wafer Shipments 4,383 4,420 3,195 3,209 3,716 4,258 4,833 5,462 Growth % 10.7% 0.9% -27.7% 0.4% 15.8% 14.6% 13.5% 13.0% Wafer ASP 1,752 2,051 2,269 2,269 2,269 2,269 2,312 2,397 Growth % 10.4% 17.1% 10.6% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.9% 3.7% Revenue (Supply) ($ mln) 7,680 9,066 7,249 7,281 8,432 9,660 11,176 13,094 Growth % 22.1% 18.1% -20.0% 0.4% 15.8% 14.6% 15.7% 17.2% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments\n\nBased on its historical 3-year average capacity increase per capex, and total capex guidance of $3.3 bln in 2024 and a flattish assumption of 0% in the forward years, we derived the capacity forecasts total through 2028. However, capacity utilization is well below its historical average, management also guided mid-60 % for 2024. Assuming it reaches it recovers to its utilization by 2028 as demand improves, we forecast its wafer shipment growth to still increase by 11.5% on average despite flattish capex.\n\nFor pricing, we assumed its pricing remained flattish based on management guidance as it stated that it is now focusing on its 12nm development rather than 14nm thus could see less growth for ASPs going forward. In 2027, as it plans to introduce 12nm that year, we estimated a 2% mix based on TSMC breakdown as a proxy and TSMC 12 nm wafer pricing of $3,984, which is 76% higher than UMC\u2019s ASPs. Overall, we forecast an average supply growth of 12.7%.\n\nOverall, we expect the company\u2019s supply growth to be flattish in 2024 due to the poor guidance for utilization at 65%, consistent with the previous year\u2019s level of 68% and the primary driver of growth due to capacity incremental based on a higher capex of $3.3 bln in 2024. From 2025 onwards, we assumed its growth for capex to be flattish and the primary driver of growth due to the increase in utilization rate. In 2026, our forecast shows lower growth compared to the previous year due to a lower growth rate in utilization rate. In 2027, our forecasts show a higher growth as we see accounted for growth upside from the introduction of its 12nm process, boosting its ASP growth. In 2028, we continue to forecast its growth increasing due to our forecast accounting for a gradual increase in the 23nm mix, leading to higher ASP growth.\n\nRevenue Projection ($ mln) 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F 2028F Demand 7,249 7,846 8,493 9,193 9,951 10,771 Growth 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% Supply 7,249 7,281 8,432 9,660 11,176 13,094 Growth 0.4% 15.8% 14.6% 15.7% 17.2% Revenue 7,249 7,281 8,432 9,193 9,951 10,771 Growth 0.4% 15.8% 9.0% 8.2% 8.2% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Khaveen Investments\n\nCompared with our supply and demand growth, we see its revenue growth constrained by demand growth instead of supply beyond 2025. Therefore, we believe the company\u2019s management guidance of capex peaking might be true and could see lower capex beyond 2024 as its capacity utilization remains well off its historical levels.\n\nRisk: Sluggish Demand Recovery\n\nThe company guided its utilization rate to remain in the mid-60s, which would not represent a significant recovery compared to 2023 levels which was 68%. Therefore, we believe this indicates demand headwinds for the company persisting this year as several end markets such as the automotive end continue to remain impacted by an oversupply of inventory as mentioned previously.\n\nVerdict\n\nAll in all, we attribute UMC\u2019s growth in 2023 to the overall weakness in the foundry market. However, we expect the company to benefit from a recovery in the PC market, new 5G technologies, and stabilizing consumer demand, despite potential headwinds in the automotive sector due to high chip inventories. We project UMC\u2019s demand growth at 8.2%, aligning with its historical performance.\n\nFurthermore, we believe UMC's expansion into 12nm technology through partnerships is promising but will impact revenue only in the long term as it plans to introduce it in 2027. We expect UMC's supply growth to remain flat in 2024 due to weak management guidance with a utilization rate of 65%. Beyond 2024, we expect growth will be driven by a recovery in utilization rates and the introduction of the 12nm process to provide a boost in ASPs. Furthermore, we expect revenue growth will be constrained by demand rather than supply, supporting management's guidance on capex peaking.\n\nKhaveen Investments\n\nBased on a discount rate of 5.4% (Company\u2019s WACC), and the company\u2019s average EV/EBITDA of 5.22x, our model shows a limited upside of 4.4% for the company, thus we rate it as a Hold with a price target of $9.09 which we believe is an appropriate rating as we continue to expect the company to face tough growth headwinds this year and intense competition from stronger competitors in the foundry market such as TSMC.",
        "summary": "Since our previous analysis, the company\u2019s revenue declined by 20% in 2023 which was well below our previous expectations.\nWe analyzed the company\u2019s market share in the foundry market below.\nNotwithstanding, we expect the company\u2019s end market demand could improve this year amid the recovery in end markets.\nWe factored this (0.67x) with our expected long-term foundry market growth rate of 12.3% and projected UMC\u2019s demand growth of 8.2%.\nThus, we examine the drivers behind the shift of the semicon industry to the 12nm process technology advancement and the rate of its adoption.",

        "title": "iLearningEngines: Strong Growth Beckoning (NASDAQ:AILE)",
        "body": "BlackJack3D\n\nIntro\n\niLearningEngines, Inc. (NASDAQ:AILE) came across our desk as a fast-growing artificial intelligence-derived company for corporate & educational use with plenty of potential. The company's mission is to revolutionize how companies approach learning, information intelligence & work automation at scale. If this can be achieved, one is looking at developing a preeminent AI ecosystem that could add serious value concerning how companies reimagine themselves going forward. Furthermore, the fact that the software can drive internal mission-critical outcomes is a major selling point and one that will not go unnoticed by companies & investors alike.\n\nAILE Can Drive Mission Critical Outcomes (Investor Presentation (May-2024))\n\nManagement compares the boom in AI-derived software services to the initial stages of the SAAS boom of yesteryear. We believe there is truth in this premise. It is a telling comparison, as companies know they have to improve everything in-house at breakneck speeds just to remain competitive. This is where sophisticated AI-driven platforms come into play, where the very best technology is set to attract interest from paying companies on mass.\n\nThe potential of the company has been evident in recent months, particularly from the standpoint when iLearningEngines became a public company back in April (through the business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp). Encouragingly, additional funding from East West Bank quickly followed the completed business combination. Then an impressive set of first-quarter numbers followed by multiple AI-driven partnerships finally turned the share price up earlier this month resulting in the stock currently trading at approximately $8.70 a share.\n\nTechnicals Improving But More Confirmation Required\n\nIn stating the above, investing in growth stocks such as AILE is all about being on the right side of the trend. As we see below on the technical chart, although shares have had an excellent June thus far, there has been little movement in the popular ADX trend-following technical indicator. Suffice it to say, a breakout above overhead resistance & and an upturn in the ADX reading (preferably above 25) would present an excellent technical setup to potentially start putting capital to work in AILE on the long side. The strength of iLearningEngines' fundamentals is in plain sight as we learn below with the company's growth of its Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) being the cornerstone of how prospective investors will view this play.\n\nAILE Technical Chart (Stockcharts.com)\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Results\n\nIn iLearningEngines' first quarter, 33% revenue growth ($125 million) resulted in Annual Recurring Revenue growth of 34% ($479 million). Licensed users grew by approximately 300k to reach 4.7 million users in the quarter. Furthermore, gross profit & adjusted EBITDA expanded and the company's net GAAP loss of $25.9 million would have actually been in positive territory but for temporary changes in fair values of both warrants & convertible notes.\n\nTherefore, not only is the company literally profitable from a bottom-line GAAP standpoint but every uptick in revenue is also going to favorably increase that key ARR metric. Moreover, any uptick in top-line growth, should over time benefit bottom-line earnings growth & the share price accordingly, which is what the market invariably wants to see. The CEO stated the following concerning iLearningEngines' bullish trends in the first quarter.\n\nAILE First Quarter Earnings Numbers (Company Website)\n\nThe first quarter was a strong start to 2024,\u201d said Harish Chidambaran, Chief Executive Officer of iLearningEngines. \u201cWe achieved 33% revenue growth year-over-year and grew annual recurring revenue1 by 34% year-over-year to $479 million. With our business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. and related financing now complete, we believe we are well positioned to invest in continued platform growth, helping more and more customers harness AI to improve their business outcomes\n\nGrowing Market Opportunity\n\nConsensus expects the company to grow its sales by strong double-digit percentages over the next two to three years. Furthermore, forward-looking sales revisions have been positive over the past 30 days, demonstrating underlying strength in AILE & its value proposition. This should not be surprising when we see the multiple verticals (similar to the SAAS boom) that iLearningEngines' verticals can be used across. To this point, although education, healthcare, insurance, & corporate upskilling may be the most obvious destinations for iLearningEngines' software, iLearningEngines' vertical coverage continues to grow. Meaningful value can be also added to the likes of automobile & retail verticals, etc concerning learnings & automation initiatives.\n\nAbove-Average Gross Profit Margin\n\nGross profit margin surpassed 69% in the first quarter, which means the trailing comparable comes in at approximately 69.15%. As we witnessed recently in the SAAS boom when functionality was swiftly migrated to the cloud, tech stocks quickly jumped on the huge spending tailwind to take advantage of the significantly increased spending by companies in this area.\n\nWell, iLearningEngines is starting well ahead of the eightball here concerning its profitability, as the sector median at present comes in at 49.43%. Why is this important? Well, if inflation were to rise from its present level (putting pressure on costs over time), AI software companies with stronger gross margins would be able to compensate for these costs all things remaining equal. This is important because a profitable iLearningEngines (as opposed to unprofitable competitors) would continue to have the wherewithal to invest in its AI ecosystem, thus potentially widening the gap between itself and the competition.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, we like what we see in iLearningEngines, especially concerning the growth in its 'Annual Recurring Revenue' and the vast number of verticals the company's software can serve. As long as there are no macro surprises over the near term (such as a strong recession or a spike in inflation, etc), current trends demonstrate growth for iLearningEngines. Remember, the risk here is that forward-looking growth rates disappoint the market, which is why we await technical confirmation where two to three weeks of more gains (higher highs) should push the needle forward. We look forward to continued coverage.",

        "title": "Nvidia: Swimming In Catalysts (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "body": "higyou/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction and Investment thesis\n\nSince my first article on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) here on SA at the beginning of this year (Nvidia: Diving Deep Into Its Technological Supremacy) the company and its stock have gone through several changes. First, the company proved to investors that demand for its AI accelerators is real and lasting, which resulted in a significantly increasing valuation multiple. That time I stated that a 100% increase in share price is my base case scenario for 2024, now we\u2019re already at +142%.\n\nIn my next article (Nvidia Q4: This is just the beginning) on the company covering FY24 Q4 earnings I\u2019ve made the following conclusion: \u201cThe recent earnings print and some other important developments since then have confirmed my thesis, with my bull-case valuation scenario slowly turning into my base-case one.\u201d My bull case at the beginning of 2024 called for a share price of $198, which is still 60% from current levels, but I am increasingly convinced that it is coming within reach. Based on my current analysis, my base-case scenario calls for a $170 share price for the end of 2024 with risks skewed to the upside.\n\nIn the following analysis, I want to present my main arguments for this, which include:\n\nThe ramp of Blackwell GPUs, especially the GB200 NVL72 rack-scale architecture in H2 delivering significant performance increase in inferencing workloads.\n\nRamping of Spectrum-X, which opens the door for Nvidia towards the $18 billion datacenter Ethernet switching market, where revenues rose almost 70% yoy in the 200/400 GbE segment, typically used in AI datacenter networking.\n\nReaccelerating revenues in China with the H20, L20 and L2 product lineup\n\nIncreasing importance of sovereign AI, where nations utilize their own infrastructure and data more efficiently with the help of generative AI.\n\nGradually increasing software revenues\n\nTaking all things together I believe there is still significant upside for fundamentals compared to current analyst estimates, which could support further increase in the share price in the second half of the year. However, this could happen at a more moderate pace than in the first half as the valuation of shares has gotten a bit ahead of itself in my opinion.\n\nAnother record quarter as new growth drivers line up\n\nNvidia continued to deliver record quarterly revenues in the FY25 Q1 quarter, driven by continued strong demand for its Hopper GPU platform. Datacenter revenues made up 86.6% of total sales in the quarter, dominating other segments to an even greater extent. Total sales came in at $26 billion, beating the company\u2019s previously set guidance by $2 billion. Analysts\u2019 estimates are usually anchored by the outlook of management, which resulted this time in a revenue consensus of $24.6 billion. This has been surpassed by little more than 5%, which shows that topline growth figures are becoming more and more predictable:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nIn my experience, management of high growth companies usually tries to leave a ~5% safety buffer when announcing guidance for the next quarter to leave comfortable room for a beat. I believe this applies to Nvidia as well, as the past two quarters tend to resemble this tendency. So, I think the best possible guess for next quarter\u2019s (FY25 Q2) revenues should be adding 5% to the recently announced guidance of $28 billion, which would result in revenues of $29.4 billion. This shows that topline growth could continue at the ~$4 billion quarterly rate in FY25 Q2 meaning that fears of reaching peak revenues are overblown.\n\nIn addition, as long as supply constraints exist, it will be much harder forecasting revenues on the short run as these bottlenecks distort the true revenue generating ability of the company. However, I believe this will have a beneficial effect over the medium term, because if demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs is met only gradually there is a lower chance for revenues suddenly felling off a cliff. This way it will be easier to detect possible turning points in the market without being too late.\n\nCurrently, the main question regarding fundamentals is how long this explosive growth could last, and what will happen to sales afterwards. Besides Jensen Huang saying that demand for H200 and the upcoming Blackwell architectures will exceed supply well into calendar year 2025 there are many other indications in my opinion that the strong topline growth dynamic won\u2019t falter over the upcoming quarters.\n\nIntroducing the Blackwell ecosystem\n\nNvidia officially announced its new Blackwell platform on its 2024 GTC conference back in March. The company claimed that the new generation of its GPUs will have significant performance advantages compared to its previous architectures, especially in the case of inferencing workloads (30x performance compared to H100 GPU-equivalent). For the first sight, I found this quite surprising as there has been no improvement in process nodes, the company based its Blackwell chips on the same 4nm TSMC manufacturing technology.\n\nA detailed piece from semianalysis confirmed that performance improvements of the new Blackwell GPUs have been mostly the result of increased silicon area rather than performance improvements on a single chip. There are 208 billion transistors in the new Blackwell GPU as it is made of two distinct dies connected to each other compared to the single-die solution of the Hopper chip family. So, increasing the computational capacity by increasing the size of the hardware doesn\u2019t seem a great improvement for the first sight.\n\nHowever, there were some other key aspects, which Nvidia\u2019s engineers managed to tweak successfully, which resulted in the new industry-leading benchmark for AI training and inference. The most important one has been the utilization of parallelism at a much higher levels than before, which could be the key success factor for the Nvidia GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system. The system, which is actually one giant GPU and could cost around $3 million consists of 36 Grace Blackwell Superchips (2 Blackwell GPUs and 1 Grace CPU each). These are connected through the NVLink-Chip-to-Chip interface, which provides applications coherent access to a unified memory speeding up computational tasks to a significant extent. Compared to the previous NVLink network in the case of H100 and H200 chips, which connected 8 GPUs, this is a significantly larger ecosystem enabling better performance. So, the real trick this time has been the connection between GPUs and not the GPU itself. The latter one will come with the introduction of the Rubin GPU family, which will feature TSMC\u2019s 3nm technology.\n\nFinally, another little trick that Nvidia used to increase the performance of its new chip family has been the introduction of FP4 precision for its Blackwell GPUs, a new generation of Tensor Cores. Tensor Cores enable mixed precision computing, where developers can use lower computational performance for lower precision tasks, thereby sparing capacity for other tasks. In practice, this can significantly reduce the time needed for developing a deep learning model.\n\nIn case of the Hopper GPU family, Nvidia introduced support for the FP8 datatype, which has been extended to the lower-precision FP4 datatype for the new Blackwell GPU family. This kind of micro-scaling enables for groups of elements within tensors to have different scaling factors, which leads to much higher throughput supporting the 4x training and 30x inference performance Nvidia has claimed for its new chip family. AMD will use the FP4 and FP6 datatypes first in its MI350 Series products, which will enter the market in 2025, so Nvidia has the first mover advantage on this front as well.\n\nI believe these features will grant a strong start for Nvidia\u2019s GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system ramping in Q3 and ensure continued strong demand for the company\u2019s AI accelerators for the upcoming quarters. As AI workloads gradually shift from training to inferencing and AI models become increasingly complex, systems that can handle computation intensive real-time inference will become increasingly valuable. The GB200 NVL72 is currently the leading example for this.\n\nNetworking revenue nearing second inflection point\n\nNvidia had a perfectly timed acquisition in 2019, where it acquired Mellanox for $6.9 billion. The company has been the main supplier of InfiniBand based networking equipment, which has been designed to connect server, storage, and networking devices in high-performance computing environments. Currently, this technology is the leading solution for connecting AI servers and serves as the basis of Nvidia\u2019s networking revenue. Despite q/q stagnation resulting from supply chain bottlenecks networking revenues reached $3.2 billion in the most recent quarter, making up 14% of datacenter revenues. Based on the company\u2019s earnings call, these bottlenecks will ease over the Q2 quarter, resulting in further growing InfiniBand revenues.\n\nHowever, the real game changer on this front has been the introduction of the Spectrum-X ethernet networking platform, which caters to ethernet-only datacenters where the InfiniBand standard doesn\u2019t get adapted. This opens a previously untapped market for Nvidia. The Ethernet switch market had a size of $44 billion in 2023, with the datacenter segment making up 41.5% of it. The segment of the highest performance switches (200/400GbE) typically used in high-performance computing environments grew almost 70% yoy making up the half of the total datacenter Ethernet switching market. This is the segment Nvidia targets with a size of roughly $9 billion in annual sales in 2023 growing 70% yoy. Based on the strong demand for AI accelerators, this dynamic should continue into 2024 and beyond, resulting in a new growth driver for Nvidia\u2019s networking business.\n\nThe recently introduced Quantum-X800 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X800 switches with 800Gb/s throughput bring AI datacenter networking to the next level, making Nvidia is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of the networking market.\n\nChinese market recovering amid strong competition\n\nAnother catalyst for Nvidia\u2019s topline growth over the upcoming quarters will be the recovering of its Chinese market. Traditionally, it has accounted for ~20% of total sales until the U.S. introduced restrictions on chip exports to the country. Nvidia came up with a solution and tweaked its GPUs to satisfy government criteria resulting in the H20, L20, and L2 GPU line up. These GPUs began to ramp recently, which is visible in the company\u2019s sales figures for the region:\n\nCreated by author based on company filings\n\nRevenues from China reached $2.5 billion for the FY25 Q1 quarter, which has been a +28% qoq improvement after the steep fall just a quarter before. This shows that Nvidia\u2019s datacenter GPUs for the Chinese market began to gain traction. However, it\u2019s important to note at this point that the Chinese market is characterized by stiff competition. Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B chips, which aren\u2019t influenced by government performance restrictions are a popular choice among Chinese customers, especially that using homemade chips is strongly encouraged by the Chinese government. However, it seems Huawei faces production bottlenecks partly resulting from U.S. restrictions on exporting chip making equipment to China. This could favor Nvidia on the short run.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Nvidia had to cut the prices of its China-specific chips recently and is selling them now for approximately the same price as Huawei its chips. This ranges somewhere between $12-$15k, which is approximately half the price of H100 GPUs the company sells in other countries. As production costs of Nvidia\u2019s China-specific GPUs could be even higher than of the H100 GPUs due to higher memory capacity, this will lead to decreasing margins overall. So, on the one hand, Nvidia could add several billions in revenues from recovering its sales in China, but on the other hand, this will result in more muted growth in additional earnings. All in all, I believe increasing China sales could extend the streak of massive topline beats, meanwhile dampening gross margins to some extent. This could be one reason that Nvidia guided for gross margin of 74.8% for the upcoming quarter after printing 78.4% in the most recent one.\n\nOther growth drivers\n\nBeside the growth drivers mentioned above, there are other important ones as well, which will have an important impact on Nvidia\u2019s growth. First, there is the opportunity resulting from sovereign AI, which encompasses a nation\u2019s ability to utilize AI technologies. There are several countries who already began to build their own supercomputers enabling them to utilize their national data more efficiently. This could be a market worth tens of billions of dollars in the close future, in my opinion.\n\nSecond, Nvidia tries to diversify its revenue stream from purely hardware to hardware and software. Software revenues consist mostly of the DGX Cloud platform and the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform, and reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in the FY24 quarter. Although this doesn\u2019t seem significant for the first sight, these are recurring revenues for the long run less affected by competitive forces.\n\nThird, it\u2019s the million-dollar question what portion of datacenter CPUs will be displaced by GPUs over the upcoming years to utilize the energy efficiency provided by accelerated computing. Hyperscalers seem to extend the useful lives of their CPUs recently, but this can\u2019t go on forever. The decisions must be made whether to make a substantial change in server equipment. Any comments, or trends that point into this direction could be a further catalyst for Nvidia, and bad news for AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\n\nBased on the above, I believe that Nvidia is only at the beginning of its major AI growth wave as there are several new fronts where sales are starting to ramp only in the second half of this year. Further positive surprises to top and bottom-line estimates should decrease richer valuation multiples in my opinion making shares investable at current levels.\n\nRisk factors\n\nBefore going on to valuation, it\u2019s important to look at key risk factors, which are worth following when investing in Nvidia shares. Increasing competitive threats should be monitored closely like Huawei in China, AMD and Intel in other parts of the world, or the self-developed chips from hyperscalers. As long as the market for datacenter GPUs is characterized by supply chain bottlenecks, there is not much to worry about, these competitive threats will gain more importance afterwards. I believe Nvidia\u2019s proprietary programming model for its GPUs, CUDA is an important tool to fend off these threats, but even in this case it will be hard to maintain double the price tag of competing products.\n\nAnother important risk factor worth monitoring closely is the political situation between China and Taiwan. If there would be an escalation in tensions between the two countries, which would impact semiconductor production in Taiwan, it could significantly disrupt the supply to China of Nvidia. TSMC, Taiwan\u2019s key chip supplier for Nvidia, is working on opening new factories elsewhere in the world, but this will take several years.\n\nFinally, another risk factor for Nvidia is further potential restrictions on chip exports to other countries, especially China. It seems that the H20, L20 and L2 GPU product lineup began to ship successfully, but the risk remains that tensions between the U.S. and China escalate further.\n\nValuation suggests more upside\n\nI have updated my valuation framework compared to my latest article on the company, which is presented below:\n\nCreated by author based on own estimates\n\nIn this framework, I accept the estimate of AMD\u2019s Lisa Su, that the datacenter accelerator market will reach a size of ~$400 billion for 2027. Looking at Nvidia\u2019s datacenter revenues in recent quarters, the accelerator market is on its way to easily exceed the $100 billion threshold this year, so current trends are convincing. In my framework, I calculate with a gradually decreasing market share for Nvidia (80% market share for 2027) as competing products gain traction, which will also pressure margins to some extent in my opinion. For simplicity, in case of other revenues, I calculate with a 10% CAGR over the forecast horizon. Finally, for the end of 2024 I assume a forward P/E ratio of 40, which is below the current level 45.7, but still elevated compared to the market in general. I believe Nvidia\u2019s strong growth prospects justify this multiple, which I assume will gradually decrease over the forecast horizon.\n\nBased on my estimates, I set the 2024 year-end price target for Nvidia at $170 per share resulting from the combination of 2025 expected EPS of $4.24 and a forward P/E multiple of 40 for the end of 2024. Current analyst estimates call for an EPS of 3.58 for 2025 (FY 2026), so I am more optimistic on this front. Compared to the actual share price, my target of $170 would result in a 37% increase in the second half of the year.\n\nBased on this, I believe that it\u2019s worth to hold on to Nvidia shares for the time being or accumulate new ones when there is a slight pullback. As earnings growth gradually decreases and the multiple attached to Nvidia\u2019s share price compresses over the years, I expect gains to be more muted than in 2023 or 2024. However, based on the number of positive catalysts, it can\u2019t be ruled out that fundamentals will experience material upward revisions, which could lead to outsized gains once again. However, this should be balanced by the risk factors mentioned in the previous section.",
        "summary": "Datacenter revenues made up 86.6% of total sales in the quarter, dominating other segments to an even greater extent.\nI believe this applies to Nvidia as well, as the past two quarters tend to resemble this tendency.\nDespite q/q stagnation resulting from supply chain bottlenecks networking revenues reached $3.2 billion in the most recent quarter, making up 14% of datacenter revenues.\nThis shows that Nvidia\u2019s datacenter GPUs for the Chinese market began to gain traction.\nOther growth driversBeside the growth drivers mentioned above, there are other important ones as well, which will have an important impact on Nvidia\u2019s growth.",

        "title": "Inogen: Improving, But Still Struggling For Air (NASDAQ:INGN)",
        "body": "JadeThaiCatwalk/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIn the fall of 2022, I believed that there was little breathing room for investors in Inogen (NASDAQ:INGN). I considered shares to be a long-term growth story, facing real execution issues, leaving few green shoots to ignite optimism.\n\nAfter a few years of stagnating sales and big losses, operating momentum is improving in recent times, driven by the exit of competitor Philips in these markets and a new management team making some right moves.\n\nAll this makes me upbeat, although any position here would still be highly speculative, with much more work to be done.\n\nCOPD Play\n\nInogen aims to help tens of millions of Americans as well as overseas patients which suffer from COPD. In fact, across the globe some 300 million people suffer from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, caused by smoking, indirect smoking, pollution, among others.\n\nThe idea is that the company provides better quality of care to these patients through portable and stationary oxygen delivery machines. This can prevent many and expensive hospitalizations. While there are other portable oxygen cylinders on the market, the solutions offered by Inogen have less weight and have ease of transport.\n\nIn the decade leading up to 2022, the company has grown sales from about $10 million to over $300 million, as this growth sparked imagination among investors as well. A $15 stock in 2014 peaked at $300 in 2018, with the business commanding a >$6 billion valuation at the time. At the peak, the company generated over $360 million in sales, but operating profits were stuck in the mid-single digits.\n\nShares were down below the $100 mark pre-pandemic and recovered a bit during 2020 as there were hopes that Inogen could play a role in tackling the pandemic crisis as well.\n\nBack to 2022\n\nAmidst the impact of the pandemic, the company posted a 15% fall in 2020 sales to $308 million as the company posted a small operating loss of $12 million. Revenues recovered by 16% in 2021, with revenues of $358 million being largely at par compared to 2019. On the bottom line, the company managed to squeeze out a $9 million operating profit for the year.\n\nWith 22 million shares trading at $27 in the fall of 2022, a market value of over $600 million included a near quarter of a billion net cash position, implying that expectations were low with operating asset trading just over $350 million, equal to about reported sales.\n\nThe company posted rather flattish sales in the first half of 2022, with declines seen on the margin front. The reality is that it as rather tricky for the company to deliver on its promises, as revenues were flattish in the $300 millions for a long period of time, with margins being rather non-existing.\n\nComing Down Further\n\nThrough the fall of last year, shares of Inogen had fallen to the $5 mark, having traded in a $6-$10 range so far this year. The reason for the continued fall in the shares is easily understood.\n\nAfter revenues peaked at $377 million in 2022, revenues fell by 16% to $315 million in 2023. The problem is not just that sales are down, but the cost structure is the real issue, as operating losses of $109 million are huge, even if we factor in a $33 million impairment charge.\n\nWith 23 million shares trading in mid-single digits, and the company holding a net cash position of $128 million, that implies that operating assets were valued close to nothing, as investors were fearful that continued losses would simply eat into the net cash position.\n\nFor the final quarter of 2023, the company posted a 14% fall in quarterly sales to nearly $76 million, running at a run rate just in excess of $300 million, as quarterly operating losses of $29 million were still very substantial. While the first quarter guidance, calling for sales between $73-$74 million, looked soft, it would mark 1-3% growth on an annual basis.\n\nIn May, the company issued some upbeat comments, with first quarter sales reported up 8% to $78.0 million, comfortably coming in ahead of the guidance. On top of the sales growth, the company managed to grow gross margins a bit, while cutting operating expenses. The mix of all this meant that operating losses narrowed, although a $16.3 million loss remained substantial. This is key as the company has seen net cash holdings come down to $120 million.\n\nIn this sense, it is comforting that the company sees second quarter sales coming in at $81-$84 million, marking decent sequential growth. Unfortunately, no margin guidance has been provided, although in all likelihood is that losses likely come down a bit.\n\nWhat Now?\n\nThe truth is that shares of Inogen have come under incredible pressure in recent years, amidst a lack of operating performance. Even at $8, operating assets of the business carry a less than $100 million operating asset valuation, a fraction of reported revenues.\n\nWhile the results from the past couple of years do not give any reasons to be upbeat from a fundamental point of view, I am encouraged by the recent revenue growth, cost cuts, and narrowing losses.\n\nPart of the increased momentum is driven by the exit of Philips from the portable oxygen concentrator market, but certainly the new management team in place has been a great contributor as well. The company has seen an acceleration as the new team unleashed some operating momentum. For the second quarter, I am keen to learn the progress being made on the bottom line.\n\nRight now, the valuations are low enough that a speculative position might be contemplated, although this would be highly speculative. Before willing to consider the shares here, I am keen to learn more about the progress in the second quarter (and beyond), as I am anxiously awaiting second quarter results before making up this neutral stance.",

        "title": "Why Nike Shares Plummeted Following Earnings (NYSE:NKE)",
        "body": "sportpoint/iStock via Getty Images\n\nI last reported on Nike (NYSE:NKE) at the end of March. In that article, I rated the stock as a Hold. The basis for my rating was largely related to the share valuation, but I voiced additional concerns regarding the company\u2019s long-term prospects. While there are many pros to consider when one evaluates Nike as a prospective investment, I questioned whether the company could continue its historic 10% sales growth, and I also contended that Nike\u2019s moat is more vulnerable than others claim.\n\nOn Thursday, Nike (NKE) provided Q4 earnings, and the stock plummeted 20% after earnings debuted. That marked the worst single day drop in the company's history.\n\nSales were up an anemic 1% for the fiscal year. Excluding the years marked by COVID and the 2008 financial crisis, fiscal year 2024 marked the worst sales growth for Nike in over two decades.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem a bit puzzling that the stock took such a swoon following earnings. After all, Nike beat the Wall Street EPS estimate by a wide margin and came close to matching consensus for revenue. However, management\u2019s commentary coupled with guidance for the coming fiscal year spoke volumes.\n\nWhat Earnings Tell Us\n\nNike\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 was well above analysts\u2019 $0.83 estimate. However,\n\n$12.6 billion in reported revenue missed consensus by $250 million.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Nike reported revenue of $51.4 billion. Although this was short of the $51.6 consensus, non-GAAP EPS of $3.95 beat analysts\u2019 $3.70 estimate.\n\nReviewing results by category, NIKE Brand sales fell 1% to $12.1 billion, and NIKE Direct sales slumped by 8% to $5.1 billion from lower sales in NIKE owned stores as well as a drop in digital sales.\n\nWholesale revenues increased by 5% to $7.1 billion for the quarter.\n\nWholesale sales dropped by 5%, and sales of the Converse line fell a whopping 18% .\n\nBy region, North America footwear sales fell 6%, but apparel climbed 4%, and equipment sales increased by 47%.\n\nIn toto, North American sales were down 1% to $5.28 billion.\n\nSales of footwear in China increased 2% while apparel sales were up 5%. As in North America, equipment sales surged, jumping 28%.\n\nAdjusted for currency, Nike recorded a 3% sales increase in China.\n\nAlthough NIKE Direct sales fell 8%, total revenue in EMEA increased 1%. Sales in NIKE stores grew 1% but NIKE Digital declined 14%. Wholesale sales were up 7%.\n\nWorldwide, sales of footwear declined by 4%, apparel sales were up 3%, and equipment sales increased by 34%. Across all categories, total sales were down by 1%.\n\nIt should be noted that while less than 5% of total sales are generated by equipment, footwear generates just over two thirds of Nike\u2019s revenue.\n\nOn a positive note, management touted lower logistics costs that resulted in a 110-basis point increase in gross margin to 44.7%.\n\nSince analysts were not forecasting a big surge in revenue, the 1% drop in sales and the modest revenue miss can\u2019t explain the dramatic drop in the share price since earnings debuted.\n\nI\u2019ll opine that management\u2019s guidance for a 10% decline in revenue in Q1 and a mid-single-digit percentage sales decline for FY 2025 is the primary cause of the stock\u2019s drop.\n\nThe Pros And Cons Of An Investment In Nike\n\nA year\u2019s results do not an investment make, let alone those of a single quarter. One can easily argue that the firm is simply going through a rough spot, and in time it will provide investors with market-beating returns.\n\nThe company absolutely dominates the competition. As I reported in my most recent Nike article, Interbrand estimates Nike's brand is worth $53.77 billion, and a study by Piper Sandler revealed that over a third of US teens rank Nike as their top apparel brand, and almost two-thirds of those rank Nike as their favorite footwear.\n\nFurthermore, one should not underestimate the ubiquity of Nike\u2019s brand when assessing the threat posed by smaller competitors. Nike has over 1,000 company stores plus another 6,000 locations operated by franchisees.\n\nBear with me as I insert some hopefully useful anecdotal information. A once avid runner, after a multiyear pause, I\u2019ve worked myself back into racing condition. As I have several old injuries that can resurface, I researched the best training and racing shoes to fit my needs.\n\nI then bought a pair of Hoka Mach 5s over the internet. Good shoe, but to my chagrin, a size 13 in this brand doesn\u2019t quite fit me.\n\nI then searched high and low for a retailer that carries ASIC Novablasts (the closest store carrying ASIC is about 35 miles away). I bought a pair, and I find Novablast to be a great shoe. I record faster times with the ASIC, and my old injuries don\u2019t flare up. Furthermore, they are extraordinarily comfortable for everyday wear.\n\nHowever, there is a downside to this story. That distant store only carries a couple of size thirteens, and that means I must settle for whatever color and/or style is available (uhm, one color, one style). Unfortunately, the shoes draw quite a bit of unwanted attention and comments. Let\u2019s just say, \u201cthey have flare?\u201d\n\nMy point being that many of Nike\u2019s competitors have a steep hurdle to conquer to simply make their products available at the same scale as that of Nike\u2019s.\n\nNow consider that Morningstar reports that Nike\u2019s revenue is more than double that of the second largest sportswear retailer, adidas (OTCQX:ADDDF), and that in 2023, Nike footwear sales were greater than Adidas, Under Armour (UAA) and Puma combined.\n\nVeteran investors understand that scale provides advantages on several levels, lowering costs in advertising, from suppliers, and oftentimes for logistics.\n\nHowever, Nike\u2019s success also creates a problem of sorts. Nike is huge, and that makes it difficult for the company to continue to grow at a robust pace.\n\nAnother negative is that several brands are gaining traction. Smaller competitors are eroding Nike\u2019s market share, and I would argue that along with the aforementioned need to grow at an ever-higher pace, these are the top problems for investors in the stock.\n\nIt\u2019s still the undoubted leader in market share terms, but in terms of the growth profile, Nike\u2019s performance can best be described as \u2018lackluster. Neil Saunders with GlobalData.\n\nYipiData\n\nIn addition to the fierce competition in the space, Nike is looking to China to spur growth, and success there is far from assured.\n\nChina should remain volatile with risk of share loss to local brands, and promo posture could increase ahead, dampening margins. Jefferies analysts\n\nFurthermore, the footwear market is projected to grow at a moderate pace over the next few years. Statista estimates a CAGR of 3.43% for the global footwear market through 2028.\n\nThe forecast by GRAND VIEW RESEARCH is a bit more sanguine. That firm projects the global footwear market will record a CAGR of 4.3% through 2030.\n\nDebt, Dividend, And Valuation\n\nInvestors need not worry over Nike\u2019s financial foundation. The company\u2019s debt is rated AA-, a high grade/investment grade rating. Cash and equivalents and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $11.6 billion, up $0.9 billion from last year.\n\nNike currently yields 1.55%. With a payout ratio just below 40% and the 5-year dividend growth rate of roughly 11%, the dividend is safe and will likely grow at a robust pace for the foreseeable future.\n\nNike currently trades for $76.32 per share.\n\nAfter the earnings report, nearly a dozen analysts lowered their price target on the stock, with J.P. Morgan downgrading Nike to a Neutral rating from Overweight and Stifel lowering the stock from a prior Buy rating to a Hold rating. Stifel also dropped its price target to $88 from $117.\n\nMorgan Stanley dropped Nike from Overweight to Equal weight, while UBS provides a Hold rating on the stock.\n\nCommentary from the last two rating agencies speaks volumes, with Alex Stratton of Morgan Stanley stating, \u201crecent performance has been riddled with quarterly misses & guidance cuts\u201d and that \u201cNKE\u2019s long-term growth & profitability trajectory is subsequently both unclear & lower than our prior assumption.\u201d\n\nJay Sole of UBS also noted that Nike\u2019s \u201c...fundamental trends are much worse than we realized. Our key conclusion is there will be no quick rebound for Nike\u2019s earnings.\".\n\nNKE has a forward P/E of 26.15x, well below the average P/E for the stock over the last 5 years of 35.60x. The 5-year PEG ratio of 2.06x is also well below the 5-year average for that metric of 2.62x.\n\nIs Nike A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?\n\nThere is no doubt that Nike has one of the most powerful brands in the world. The company ranks as the largest athletic footwear brand in every major category and every major market.\n\nHowever, competition in this space is fierce, and sales growth for Nike is far from assured. As noted above, during the earnings call, management guided for a 10% decline in sales for the coming quarter, and a mid-single-digit percentage sales decline for this fiscal year.\n\nI\u2019ve made the point that one advantage Nike has over smaller competitors is the vast geographic scale in terms of the company\u2019s brick and mortar presence. However, Nike\u2019s share of l the digital market fell to 32.5%, versus a 34.1% share in the comparable quarter.\n\nI\u2019ll also use Hoka (DECK) to contrast Nike\u2019s recent results with that of smaller competitors. While Nike\u2019s North American footwear revenue dropped by 6% this quarter compared to Q4 of 2023, Hoka\u2019s sales surged 34% in that same time frame.\n\nIf you take a look at Nike\u2019s investor relations website, the first thing you\u2019ll see, in big, bold capital letters, is \u201cNIKE, INC. IS A GROWTH COMPANY.\u201d\n\nHowever, therein lies a problem. Arguably the greatest potential downside for investors is that Nike\u2019s success means it takes more growth to drive the stock higher.\n\nWhile I\u2019ll readily concede that Nike is a quality company that dominates its market, I question whether it can sustain the growth rates we\u2019ve witnessed over the past years.\n\nI rate Nike as a HOLD.\n\nI will add that I would not be surprised if the share price increases markedly by year\u2019s end. However, I am largely a buy and hold investor, and I invest seeking safe, long-term results. Therefore, I don\u2019t hold a position in NKE, and I have no intention to initiate an investment in the company for the foreseeable future.",

        "title": "Riding The GenAI Wave: Omnicom's Double-Edged Sword (NYSE:OMC)",
        "body": "andresr\n\nIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, not the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin\n\nWhile there is some debate about whether the quote above was really from Charles Darwin or just a paraphrase of his ideas, there is a lot of truth to the value of adaptability. Perhaps no other economist explained the value of \"waves of creative destruction\" better than Joseph Schumpeter, which gives companies a significant incentive to disrupt themselves before a competitor does, and for this, continuous innovation is a must.\n\nRight now one of the biggest disruption risks for many companies, including Omnicom (NYSE:OMC), is being delivered by generative AI. Fortune recently reported there has been a massive increase in GenAI discussions during earnings calls with managements expecting a massive technological shift. Omnicom is among those companies talking about generative AI, as it is clear it will have an oversized impact on its industry. The company is taking a positive view, seeing the technology providing more benefits than risk of substitution, but we are not fully convinced. In any case, we are going to update our thesis with the most recent financial results and Omnicom's GenAI strategy. We last wrote about the company a little over a year ago, downgrading it to a \"Hold\" rating, as we saw shares fully valued. It appears to have been the right call, as shares have delivered a total return of only about 1.4%, massively underperforming the S&P 500 index (SPY), which has since delivered a total return over 32%.\n\nFlywheel Acquisition\n\nOne easy tactic to avoid disruption is to buyout one of the innovative startups posing a challenge. This worked well for Meta (META) when it realized that Instagram was growing at warp speed and could eventually be a threat. Similarly, Google (GOOGL) realized video was going to become increasingly important on the Internet. While they first attempted a \"build it\" strategy with Google Videos, eventually they realized it would be easier to buyout YouTube. Even Blockbuster had the opportunity to purchase Netflix (NFLX), but they passed with disastrous consequences for the company.\n\nFor Omnicom, startups addressing e-commerce and digital media marketing are an increasing threat. To its credit, the company made what looks like a smart acquisition with the Flywheel purchase. While the $835 million net cash purchase price looks relatively expensive, it still makes strategic sense for the company. For perspective, Omnicom is currently trading with a Price/Sales ratio of about 1.2x, while the acquisition was closer to a 3x multiple. CEO John Wren explained the thinking behind the acquisition in a press release in which he stated, \u201cE-commerce sales worldwide are set to increase by 50%, reaching about $7 trillion dollars by 2025. The acquisition of Flywheel significantly broadens our reach and influence in the rapidly expanding digital commerce and retail media sectors, two of the fastest-growing parts of the industry\".\n\nFlywheel is therefore expected to enhance Omnicom's growth profile, and the company is guiding for the acquisition to be accretive to diluted EPS by Q4 2024 and thereafter. It helps that most of the acquisition is being financed at a relatively low interest rate in Euros. Some synergies are also expected from the combination of Flywheel with Omnicom's existing audience & behavioral data platform. This enhanced business should enable brands to sell more goods, more efficiently, across leading global digital marketplaces such as Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Kroger (KR), and Alibaba (BABA). It will allow clients to automate, optimize, and measure their digital media spend across these marketplaces.\n\nOmnicom Investor Presentation\n\nThe GenAI Challenge\n\nIn our opinion the most interesting part of the most recent earnings call came during the Q&A session of the call when an analyst asked whether generative AI would help or hurt the company. While it is clear that it can automate some of the tasks that Omnicom's employees used to do manually, many fear that it is getting so good that at some point their customers could bypass the company and use it directly themselves.\n\nCEO John Wren has a good point that if everyone asks the large-language model the same question, eventually all marketing campaigns will look and feel the same. He argues that a talented creative is still needed to guide the tool, using it to perhaps brainstorm or iterate over ideas more quickly, but retaining creative control of the final deliverable. While that is probably true at the moment, we are not fully convinced it will not change in a few years. Another weakness we see is that the company is currently partnering with companies like Alphabet and Shutterstock (SSTK) to use their generative AI tools in Omnicom's workflow. While this is considerably less expensive than developing specialized large language models (LLMs) in-house, it means the company has little differentiation compared to competitors and even its own customers testing the technology. In any case, below we include the CEO's response to the benefits and risks that generative AI presents:\n\n[...] The single largest benefit of generative AI as we're using it is it makes it simpler for highly creative people to come up with different executions, different applications of their ideas across many different mediums and using the specific Omni data that we have and Flywheel commerce data to help understand where the consumer is and the messaging that we have to create in order to reach that consumer. So as this goes forward, automation affects every single part of the business, AI will affect every single part of the business and the programs and the things that we're doing are to take that on board to evaluate and shift up as a market leader and even in advance of testing things that are available or hopefully will become commercially available at some point in the future. I guess if there's a downside to it, it's a lot of the things that in the past might have been done manually and somebody got paid to do that execution work, which was typically pretty boring and repetitive, that gets eliminated. So you're not seeking to hire those level people to do that level of job and therefore get reimbursed at a profit for them. But what you are doing is, you're able to come up with better, cleaner, sharper ideas, which can either succeed fast or fail fast. And all that at the end of the day, benefits the client and makes the ROI on a marketing dollar spent greater. And that's where I think the contribution of generative AI is going to come in. And it's been my experience over my career, the more clarity I can bring to a client and explaining what the ROI is on the next dollar of marketing he's going to spend or she's going to spend means that we probably are going to benefit from that in servicing in some fashion. So philosophically, and there's a lot of moving pieces that are going on all the time and have been for quite a while now. But pretty intensely, adjusting to and exploiting where we can, those the things that generative AI does. But Paolo, who we've met before in previous calls, I think is really the guy that I depend upon, among others on this, and he works very closely with all of our suppliers and vendors. Paolo? Paolo Yuvienco Yeah. Sure. Hi, Michael. So look, I think you've heard us talk about this in the past that we really believe that generative AI strictly is going to empower our people and really give them super powers for the skills that they already have. I think we look at it through the lens of a maturity model with respect to how they are executing their tasks. In the recent past, generative AI has really just been a tool. Today, it's more of an assistant or co-pilot, if you will. And really, tomorrow, it becomes a true partner, whether it be a creative partner, a strategic partner, planning partner for every one of our employees. So that is effectively how we're approaching it and how we're building it into Omni to provide that partner for everyone.\n\nFinancials\n\nWe liked Omnicom better when it was priced like a \"melting ice-cube\" investment, as we thought the company had potential to keep growing even if at a modest rate. As the company has demonstrated that mid-single digit revenue growth is possible, shares have re-rated higher and motivated us to move to a \"Hold\" rating.\n\nDespite a challenging environment, Omnicom managed to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter, with particularly strong growth in advertising and media. Other business segments showed negative performance, including Public Relations and Branding & Retail Commerce.\n\nOmnicom Investor Presentation\n\nWhile the Flywheel acquisition was not cheap, at least it was financed at attractive rates given the current environment. The company managed to raise \u20ac600 million maturing in March 2032 at a 3.7% interest rate. This increased the total outstanding debt to roughly $6.3 billion, although net debt is significantly lower thanks to cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $3.2 billion. The company has managed to maintain a strong operating margin, and mentioned some initiatives like real estate rationalization during the last earnings call. Small improvements to the operating margin, combined with significant share repurchases, have resulted in meaningful earnings per share growth.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPeers\n\nOmnicom and its competitor Publicis Groupe SA (OTCQX:PGPEF) are trading with similar forward EV/EBITDA ratios, while WPP plc (WPP) and the Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) have meaningfully lower multiples.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWe believe the premium is warranted, as Omnicom and Publicis are expected to deliver higher revenue growth and better free cash flow margins.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nEven after paying for the Flywheel acquisition, Omnicom's balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Its net debt to EBITDA ratio is only 1.3x, it has a well-laddered maturity schedule, and it managed to issue debt at remarkably low rates. For example, its senior notes maturing in July 2027, which are denominated in Euros, carry an interest rate of less than 1%. More recently, it managed to issue \u20ac600 million at a rate below 4% to finance the Flywheel acquisition.\n\nOmnicom Investor Presentation\n\nShareholder Returns\n\nOmnicom can be interesting to dividend investors, as it currently has a yield above 3%. We were more interested when it was above 4% and Treasuries were lower compared to current rates. Still, if share repurchases are considered, total shareholder returns are not insignificant, and typically above 6%. The company has been aggressively buying back shares, even if recently moderated repurchases due to the Flywheel acquisition.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nOver time this has resulted in an impressive reduction in shares outstanding, which has significantly contributed to earnings per share growth.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe company is guiding for fiscal year 2024 EBITDA margin to be close to flat with 2023. As a result earnings per share are probably going to depend on revenue growth and repurchases. Assuming a mid-single-digit revenue growth for the year, and a buyback yield of 2% to 3%, we think the best case the company deliver high-single-digit EPS growth.\n\nNow, looking further ahead it becomes considerably more difficult to assess the future potential of the business. We do worry that while generative AI will probably reduce costs for the company and generate efficiencies, longer-term it could improve to the point that customers can use the tools themselves to create their marketing and advertising assets. We see a lot of promise with the Flywheel acquisition, and it should benefit from network effects and continued e-commerce growth. Still, putting everything together we do believe risks and uncertainty have increased.\n\nValuation\n\nMost valuation metrics are very close to their ten-year averages, including its EV/EBITDA multiple which is almost identical to the historical average. The Price/Sales multiple is slightly higher, but the Price/Earnings ratio is actually lower as margins have improved. Overall we do not think shares are expensive, but neither do we think they are currently a very attractive opportunity. Especially when taking into consideration the risk that generative AI poses to the future of the business.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nRisks\n\nEven though the valuation appears reasonable, advertising and marketing companies have a history of significant draw-downs in their share prices during recessions, as customers preferable cutting these expenses before laying off employees or other more painful measures. As can be seen in the graph below, Omnicom has had bigger draw-downs compared to the S&P 500 index during most recessions, with the exception of the global financial crisis where it was almost identical. With the economy showing signs of weakening, this is probably not the best time to start a position. In any case, we are even more worried about the potential disruption generative AI could bring in a few years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter reviewing the most recent financial results and studying the Flywheel acquisition, we are maintaining our \"Hold\" rating. Shares currently appear reasonably valued, even if we see increased risks down the road from potential disruption from generative AI. For the time being the company reports generative AI helping more than hindering its business, but if the technology continues its rapid advance this balance could quickly change to the company's detriment. Still, there are some reasons for cautious optimism, including the Flywheel acquisition. It was certainly not cheap, but at least it was financed at attractive rates and positions the company well to meaningfully profit from e-commerce's growth.",

        "title": "American Express: A Fintech Powerhouse With Growth Momentum, Buy (NYSE:AXP)",
        "body": "RealPeopleGroup/E+ via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a financial services company that's been experiencing strong growth. Their revenue grew 11% YoY in Q1 2024 with EPS soaring 39%. The company itself projects full year revenue growth of 9% to 11% and EPS growth of 13% to 17%. This positive performance is backed by strong credit quality with delinquency rates remaining low.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nI originally started this article to analyze if AXP was a good candidate for my \"value with potential portfolio\" and I found that an attractive feature of AXP is its reasonable valuation compared to its growth prospects. This stands out to me in a market where valuations are getting higher. Another positive feature is its dividend income, which, although I consider it low in the industry, was increased by 17% and the company has positive ratings for growth, consistency, and Safety on Seeking Alpha. AXP low payout ratio suggests there's room for even more dividend growth in the future.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWhile American Express appears to be a good long-term investment, there are some risks to consider. Their business model is sensitive to economic downturns that could impact consumer spending. I also consider AXP to be part of the Global Fintech industry, which despite the slowdown in 2023, is expected to grow from the current $245 Billion industry today to $1.5 Trillion by 2030 and take a 7% share of the financial industry from the current 2% according to Boston Consulting Group.\n\nIn this article, I aim to find if AXP is a solid candidate for my value with potential portfolio. To accomplish this, I will explore various factors like Management effectiveness, corporate strategy, and valuation to determine if AXP aligns with this investment style. As you will find out at the end, I have decided to start my coverage of AXP with a Buy rating given its potential for growth, market position and macro factors that impact style rotation.\n\nManagement Evaluation\n\nAmerican Express is thriving under CEO Stephen Squeri's leadership. His 38-year tenure and high approval rating indicate a deep understanding and commitment to the company's success. While his total compensation, including stock awards, is high, it reflects his long-term career with the company. I believe this has \"high alignment ratio\" with the company's success.\n\nSalary.com\n\nDuring the last earnings call, Squeri discussed American Express impressive growth, exceeding expectations in Q1 2024. They're confident in their full-year guidance thanks to strong spending, a focus on premium cards, and attracting younger demographics. He insisted that customer satisfaction is a priority, achieved through frequent updates to their value proposition. Their strategy resonates with younger generations, and they're gaining market share despite a slowdown in small business spending. International markets are a significant growth engine, and they view competition from fintechs as a potential learning and partnership opportunity.\n\nGlassdoor\n\nAmerican Express also thrives under Christopher Le Caillec's, the company's CFO, 25-year leadership. His experience and team-building skills fuel the company financial success. Q1 results surpassed expectations with 11% revenue growth. They maintain industry-leading profitability and prioritize customer engagement through premium card offerings and rewards programs.\n\nLe Caillec took the CFO role at the end of last year and is expected that he builds on the successful steps of the prior CFO, Jeffrey C. Campbell, who retired. American Express has an industry leading ROA ratio of 3.34% vs 1.07% and ROE of 32.85% vs 10.61%. He is also expected to keep growing dividend payments, last quarter the dividend increase was 17% with a 20% payout ratio.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nOverall, I find that American Express leadership delivered a positive message on the last earnings call. Specifically, Squeri seems to be managing the current high interest rate environment successfully with revenue and assets growth. Financially, I am expecting Le Caillec to build on the long-term career at the company and continue the success of his predecessor. Given all these factors, I am rating AXP management a \"Meets expectations\".\n\nCorporate Strategy\n\nAmerican Express prioritizes growth in premium cards, attracting younger demographics like Millennials and Gen Z through partnerships and benefits. They achieve this through frequent value proposition updates and a focus on customer satisfaction. International markets are another key area of expansion. I find that despite maintaining a lower net income margin compared to some competitors, their high-quality customer base allows them to excel in profitability metrics like ROA and ROE. It seems to me that they are committed to returning capital to shareholders by growing their dividend for two years in a row but also maintaining a strong balance sheet, keeping a low dividend payout ratio.\n\nHere is a table I created with key differentiators between AXP and some companies in the industry offering similar services:\n\nAmerican Express Capital One (COF) Discover (DFS) Synchrony Financial (SYF) Corporate Strategy Premium cards, international expansion, attracting younger generations, customer engagements, Fintech characteristic, exploring blockchain and crypto product Focus on underserved and credit challenged segments. Innovation in Digital banking and mobile apps. Attracting younger generation through tech savvy approach. Rewards program Target customers with limited credit history. Offer rewards programs and cash back incentives. Focus on building customer loyalty. Invest in digital marketing and customer service Partner with retailers to offer co-branded credit cards. Focus on specific retail segments. Leverage partner networks for customer acquisition. Offer targeted rewards programs. Advantages Leader advantage in premium cards and benefits. Strong global brand and solid prime customer base. Solid balance sheet. Innovation focus. Strong digital presence. Expertise in attracting non-primer customers. Competitive interest rates on savings accounts attracting deposits. Strong brand recognition in rewards programs in the US. Expertise in catering to non-prime customers. Competitive interest rates on some products Expertise in cobranded cards and retail partnerships. Strong customer acquisition through partner networks. Competitive interest rates on some cobranded cards. Disadvantages Higher fees associated with premium cards. Lower profitability compared to AXP. Higher credit risk due to focus on non-primer customers Lower profitability compared to AXP. Higher credit risk due to focus on non-primer customers Limited control over brand messaging relying on partners for growth Click to enlarge\n\nSource: From companies' website, presentations, Seeking Alpha\n\nValuation\n\nAXP currently trades at around $231.55. The stock is up around 6% since its last reported earnings in mid-April and hovering around its all-time high of $244.41 achieved just recently. The stock, however, is up around 24.38% YTD.\n\nNow, to assess its value, I employed an 11% discount rate, this rate reflects the minimum return an investor expects to receive for their investments. Here, I am using a 5% risk free rate, combined with the additional market risk premium for holding stocks versus risk free investments, I'm using 6% for this risk premium. While this could be further refined, lower or higher, I'm using it as a starting point only to get a gauge using unbiased market expectations.\n\nThen, using a simple 10-year two staged DCF model, I reversed the formula to solve for the high-growth rate, that is the growth in the first stage.\n\nTo achieve this, I assumed a terminal growth rate of 4% in the second stage. Predicting growth beyond a 10-year horizon is challenging, but in my experience, a 4% rate reflects a more sustainable long-term trajectory for mature companies that should be close to historical GDP growth. Again, these assumptions can be higher or lower, but from my experience I will use a 4% rate as a base case scenario due to the nature of their business. The formula used is:\n\n$231.55 = (sum^10 EPS (1 + \"X\") / 1+r)) + TV (sum^10 EPS (1+g) / (1+r))\n\nSolving for x = 10%\n\nThis suggests that the market currently prices AXP EPS to grow at 10%. According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus EPS over the next 3-5 years CAGR at 15.11%. Therefore, it seems that AXP is undervalued on a fundamental basis.\n\nFurther, I'll also look at their price earnings to growth (PEG) ratio sits at 1.17x -versus a sector median of 1.13x- implying the stock price is in line with the industry. Also, their price to sales (P/B) ratio seems overvalued but when compared to a select group of companies, highlighted below, that are considered leaders in the industry, this overvaluation makes sense to me as AXP has lower risk and higher ROA.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAXP has been on a positive momentum this year. However, on a technical basis, the stock looks appropriately valued, its 1-year average RSI it's in neutral territory at 50 and slightly above its 14-day moving average of 42 indicating the stock price might be changing trends.\n\nTradingView\n\nAXP has formed a strong support level at just shy of $244 and a resistance level at just under $220, the stock should move around this band awaiting more news and breach its all-time high. Next earnings report is estimated to be on July 19.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmerican Express is a leader in the premium credit card business with a growing bank catering to small and medium size businesses. They boast impressive growth and project strong future financials, attracting newer generations like GenZers and expanding in international markets. I also find that they have Fintech-like characteristics, investing in innovation and new product developments. While economic downturns and fintech disruption are potential risks, AXP's financial strength as highlighted by the recent dividend increase and low payout ratio, solidify their position as a leader. I will start my coverage of AXP with a buy. Please let me know your thoughts below.",

For more on the companion U.S. Treasury simulation, please contact the author. Both the Bund and the U.S. Treasury yield simulations impact foreign exchange rates, resulting in the following distribution of the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate one year forward:\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nPricing for short- and long-dated options to buy Euros versus U.S. dollars at a strike price of 1.07 for quarterly maturities out to 30 years is given below:\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nThis Week\u2019s Simulation of Bund Yields\n\nAs explained in Prof. Robert Jarrow\u2019s book, cited below, forward rates contain a risk premium above and beyond the market\u2019s expectations for the 3-month forward rate. We document the size of that risk premium in the graph below, which shows the zero-coupon yield curve implied by current German Bund prices compared with the annualized compounded yield on 3-month bills that market participants would expect based on the daily movement of government bond yields in 14 countries since 1962. The risk premium, the reward for a long-term investment, is moderately positive and remains so over the full maturity range to 30 years. The graph also shows a steady downward shift in yields in the first seven years, as explained below, followed by a gradual rise.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nFor more on this topic, see the analysis of government bond yields in 14 countries through May 31, 2024 given in the appendix.\n\nInverted Yields, Negative Rates, and German Bund Probabilities 10 Years Forward\n\nIn this week\u2019s Euro zone forecast, the focus is on three elements of interest rate behavior: the future probability of the recession-predicting inverted yield curve, the probability of negative rates, and the probability distribution of German Bund yields over the next decade.\n\nWe start from the closing German Bund yield curve published daily by the Deutsche Bundesbank and other information sources. Using a maximum smoothness forward rate approach, Friday\u2019s implied forward rate curve shows 1-month rates at an initial peak of 3.36%, compared to 3.36% last week. As maturities lengthen, there is some volatility until rates peak again at 3.34%, compared to 3.20% last week, and then decline to a lower plateau of 2.66%, compared to 2.55% last week, at the end of the 30-year horizon.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nUsing the methodology outlined in the appendix, we simulate 100,000 future paths for the German Bund yield curve out to thirty years. The next three sections summarize our conclusions from that simulation.\n\nInverted Bund Yields: Inverted Now, 60.4% Probability by December 27, 2024\n\nA large number of economists have concluded that a downward sloping yield curve is an important indicator of future recessions. A recent example is this paper by Alex Domash and Lawrence H. Summers.\n\nWe measure the probability that the 10-year par coupon Bund yield is lower than the 2- year par coupon Bund for every scenario in each of the first 80 quarterly periods in the simulation.[1] The next graph shows that the probability of an inverted yield peaks at 60.4% in the 91-day quarterly period ending December 27, 2024 compared to 65.0% last week.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nNegative 3-Month Yields: 21.2% Probability by February 20, 2054\n\nThe next graph describes the probability of negative 3-month bill rates for all but the first 3 months of the next 3 decades. The probability of negative rates starts near zero but peaks at 21.2%, compared to 21.8% last week, in the period ending February 20, 2054.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nCalculating the Default Risk from Interest Rate Maturity Mismatches\n\nIn light of the interest-rate-risk-driven failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States on March 10, 2023, we have added a table that applies equally well to banks, institutional investor, and individual investor mismatches from buying long-term German Bunds with borrowed short-term funds. We assume that the sole asset is a 10-year German Bund purchased at time zero at par value of 100 euros. We analyze default risk for four different initial market values of equity to market value of asset ratios: 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. For the banking example, we assume that the only class of liabilities is deposits that can be withdrawn at par at any time. In the institutional and retail investor case, we assume that the liability is essentially a borrowing on margin/repurchase agreement with the possibility of margin calls. For all investors, the amount of liabilities (95, 90, 85 or 80) represents a \u201cstrike price\u201d on a put option held by the liability holders. Failure occurs via a margin call, bank run, or regulatory take-over (in the banking case) when the value of assets falls below the value of liabilities.\n\nThe chart below shows the cumulative 10-year probabilities of failure for each of the 4 possible capital ratios when the asset\u2019s maturity is 10 years. For the 5 percent case, that default probability is 44.40%, a change from 44.13% last week.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nThis default probability analysis is updated weekly based on the German Bund yield simulation described in the next section. The calculation process is the same for any portfolio of assets with credit risk included.\n\nGerman Bund Yield Probabilities 10 Years Forward\n\nIn this section, the focus turns to the decade ahead. This week\u2019s simulation shows that the most likely range for the 3-month bill yield in the Bund market in ten years is from 0% to 1%, unchanged from last week. There is a 25.82% probability that the 3-month yield falls in this range, a change from 26.07% one week before. Note the shift downward in the second and third semi-annual periods. For the 10-year Bund yield, the most likely range is from 1% to 2%, also unchanged from last week. The probability of being in this range is 21.96%, compared to 22.19% one week prior.\n\nIn a recent post on Seeking Alpha, we pointed out that a forecast of \u201cheads\u201d or \u201ctails\u201d in a coin flip leaves out critical information. What a sophisticated bettor needs to know is that, on average for a fair coin, the probability of heads is 50%. A forecast that the next coin flip will be \u201cheads\u201d is literally worth nothing to investors because the outcome is purely random.\n\nThe same is true for interest rates.\n\nIn this section, we present the detailed probability distribution for both the 3-month bill rate and the 10-year Bund yield 10 years forward using semi-annual time steps[2]. We present the probability of where rates will be at each time step in 1 percent \u201crate buckets.\u201d The forecast for 3-month bill yields is shown in this graph:\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\n3-Month Bill Yield Data:\n\nSASDEU3m20240628.xlsx\n\nThe probability that the 3-month bill yield will be between 1% and 2% in 2 years is shown in column 4: 29.92%. The probability that the 3-month yield will be negative (as it has been often in Europe and Japan) in 2 years is 9.21% plus 1.19% plus 0.07% plus 0.00% = 10.47% (difference due to rounding). Cells shaded in blue represent positive probabilities of occurring, but the probability has been rounded to the nearest 0.01%. The shading scheme works like this:\n\nDark blue: the probability is greater than 0% but less than 1%\n\nLight blue: the probability is greater than or equal to 1% and less than 5%\n\nLight yellow: the probability is greater than or equal to 5% and 10%\n\nMedium yellow: the probability is greater than or equal to 10% and less than 20%\n\nOrange: the probability is greater than or equal to 20% and less than 25%\n\nRed: the probability is greater than 25%\n\nThe chart below shows the same probabilities for the 10-year Bund yield derived as part of the same simulation.\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\n10-Year German Bund Yield Data:\n\nSASDEU10y20240628.xlsx\n\nAppendix: Bund Yield Simulation Methodology\n\nThe probabilities are derived using the same methodology that SAS Institute Inc. recommends to its KRIS\u00ae and Kamakura Risk Manager\u00ae clients. A moderately technical explanation is given later in the appendix, but we summarize it briefly first.\n\nStep 1: We take the closing Bund yield curve as our starting point.\n\nStep 2: We use the number of points on the yield curve that best explains historical yield curve shifts. We note in the following graph that Bund yields span (by rate level and maturity) only 40.94% of the historical experience in 14 countries:\n\nSAS Institute Inc.\n\nFor the highest degree of realism in a forward-looking simulation, using the international database is essential. Using daily government bond yield data from 14 countries from 1962 through May 31, 2024, we conclude that 12 \u201cfactors\u201d drive almost all movements of government bond yields. The countries on which the analysis is based are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand. Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. No data from Russia is included after January 2022.\n\nStep 3: We measure the volatility of changes in those factors and how volatility has changed over the same period.\n\nStep 4: Using those measured volatilities, we generate 100,000 random shocks at each time step and derive the resulting yield curve.\n\nStep 5: We \u201cvalidate\u201d the model to make sure that the simulation EXACTLY prices the starting Bund curve and that it fits history as well as possible. The methodology for doing this is described below.\n\nStep 6: We take all 100,000 simulated yield curves and calculate the probabilities that yields fall in each of the 1% \u201cbuckets\u201d displayed in the graph.\n\nDo Nominal Yields Accurately Reflect Expected Future Inflation?\n\nWe showed in a recent post on Seeking Alpha that, on average, investors have almost always done better by buying long-term bonds than by rolling over short-term Treasury bills in the United States. That means that market participants have generally (but not always) been accurate in forecasting future inflation and adding a risk premium to that forecast. This study is being updated using the 14-country data set in coming weeks.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nDaily government bond yields from the 14 countries listed above form the base historical data for fitting the number of yield curve factors and their volatility. The Bund historical data is provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The use of the international bond data increases the number of observations to more than 107,000 and provides a more complete range of experience with both high rates and negative rates than a Bund data set alone provides.\n\nThe modeling process was published in a very important paper by David Heath, Robert Jarrow and Andrew Morton in 1992:\n\nEconometrica\n\nThe no-arbitrage foreign exchange rate simulation is based on this well-known paper by Amin and Jarrow:\n\nJournal of International Money and Finance\n\nFor technically inclined readers, we recommend Prof. Jarrow\u2019s book Modeling Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options for those who want to know exactly how the \u201cHJM\u201d model construction works.\n\nThe number of factors, 12 for the 14-country model, has been stable since June 30, 2017.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] After the first 20 years in the simulation, the 10-year yield cannot be derived from the initial 30-year term structure of yields.\n\n[2] The actual simulation uses 91-day time steps and spans a 30-year time horizon.\n\nEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

        "title": "UDOW And Leveraged ETFs Dashboard For July",
        "body": "hatman12\n\nProShares UltraPro Dow30 ETF (NYSEARCA:UDOW) is a popular instrument to trade in bullish market conditions. However, its daily 3X leverage factor on the Dow Jones is a source of drift, which may be positive or negative. It must be closely monitored to detect changes in the drift regime. This article explains what \"drift\" means, quantifies it in 22 leveraged ETFs, and reports historical data on UDOW.\n\nWhy leveraged ETFs drift\n\nLeveraged ETFs often underperform their underlying index leveraged by the same factor. The decay has essentially four reasons: beta-slippage, roll yield, tracking errors, management costs. Beta-slippage is the main reason in equity leveraged ETFs. To understand what is beta-slippage, imagine a very volatile asset that goes up 25% one day and down 20% the day after. A perfect double leveraged ETF goes up 50% the first day and down 40% the second day. On the close of the second day, the underlying asset is back to its initial price:\n\n(1 + 0.25) x (1 - 0.2) = 1\n\nIn the same time, the perfect leveraged ETF has lost 10%:\n\n(1 + 0.5) x (1 - 0.4) = 0.9\n\nIt is not a scam, just the normal behavior of a leveraged and rebalanced portfolio. A good news: in a trending market, beta-slippage can be positive. If the underlying index goes up 10% two days in a row, on the second day, it is up 21%:\n\n(1 + 0.1) * (1 + 0.1) = 1.21\n\nThe perfect 2x leveraged ETFs is up 44%:\n\n(1 + 0.2) * (1 + 0.2) = 1.44\n\nBeta-slippage is path-dependent. If the underlying index gains 50% on day 1 and loses 33.33% on day 2, it is back to its initial value, like in the first example. However, the 2x ETF loses one third of its value, instead of 10% in the first case:\n\n(1 + 1) x (1 - 0.6667) = 0.6667\n\nWithout a demonstration, it shows that the higher the volatility, the higher the decay.\n\nMonthly and yearly drift watchlist\n\nThere is no standard or universally recognized definition for the drift of a leveraged ETF. Some are quite complicated. Mine is simple and based on the difference between the leveraged ETF performance and \u00d1 times the performance of the underlying index on a given time interval, with \u00d1 as the leveraging factor. Most of the time, this factor defines a daily objective relative to an underlying index. However, some dividend-oriented leveraged products have been defined with a monthly objective (mostly defunct ETNs: CEFL, BDCL, SDYL, MLPQ, MORL\u2026).\n\nFirst, let's define \"Return\": it is the return of a leveraged ETF in a time interval, including dividends. \"IndexReturn\" is the return of a non-leveraged ETF on the same underlying asset in the same time interval, also including dividends. \"Abs\" is the absolute value operator. \"Drift\" is calculated as follows:\n\nDrift = (Return - (IndexReturn x \u00d1))/ Abs(\u00d1)\n\n\"Decay\" means negative drift.\n\nIndex \u00d1 Ticker 1-month Return 1-month Drift 1-year Return 1-year Drift S&P 500 1 SPY 3.78% 0.00% 26.45% 0.00% 2 SSO 6.99% -0.29% 47.30% -2.80% -2 SDS -6.09% 0.74% -30.29% 11.31% 3 UPRO 10.40% -0.31% 71.00% -2.78% -3 SPXU -9.19% 0.72% -44.13% 11.74% ICE US20+ T bond 1 TLT 3.50% 0.00% -7.99% 0.00% 3 TMF 8.84% -0.55% -37.33% -4.45% -3 TMV -9.38% 0.37% 32.06% 2.70% NASDAQ 100 1 QQQ 5.13% 0.00% 32.34% 0.00% 3 TQQQ 14.57% -0.27% 89.77% -2.42% -3 SQQQ -12.88% 0.84% -54.69% 14.11% DJ 30 1 DIA 1.93% 0.00% 17.66% 0.00% 3 UDOW 4.59% -0.40% 38.93% -4.68% -3 SDOW -4.22% 0.52% -29.54% 7.81% Russell 2000 1 IWM 0.66% 0.00% 11.63% 0.00% 3 TNA 0.07% -0.64% 9.93% -8.32% -3 TZA -0.80% 0.39% -29.84% 1.68% MSCI Emerging 1 EEM 1.33% 0.00% 10.73% 0.00% 3 EDC 2.46% -0.51% 11.73% -6.82% -3 EDZ -2.80% 0.40% -19.83% 4.12% Gold spot 1 GLD -0.53% 0.00% 21.28% 0.00% 2 UGL -1.86% -0.40% 33.53% -4.52% -2 GLL 1.59% 0.27% -25.87% 8.35% Silver spot 1 SLV -8.91% 0.00% 27.50% 0.00% 2 AGQ -19.16% -0.67% 37.98% -8.51% -2 ZSL 16.38% -0.72% -45.08% 4.96% S&P Biotech Select 1 XBI 6.11% 0.00% 10.55% 0.00% 3 LABU 16.01% -0.77% -6.07% -12.57% -3 LABD -17.16% 0.39% -45.64% -4.66% PHLX Semicond. 1 SOXX 3.94% 0.00% 49.32% 0.00% 3 SOXL 8.90% -0.97% 135.16% -4.27% -3 SOXS -12.73% -0.30% -77.09% 23.62% Click to enlarge\n\nThe leveraged bull semiconductors ETF (SOXL) has the worst monthly decay of this list: -0.97%. The highest positive drift in one month is for the bear NASDAQ 100 ETF (SQQQ): +0.84%.\n\nThe bull biotechnology ETF (LABU) has the worst 12-month decay (-12.57%), while the bear semiconductors ETF (SOXS) shows the highest positive drift in the same period: 23.62%.\n\nPositive drift follows a steady trend in the underlying asset, whatever the trend direction and the ETF direction. It means positive drift may come with a gain or a loss for the ETF. Negative drift comes with daily return volatility (\"whipsaw\"). Both bull and bear biotechnology ETFs have negative drifts over the last 12 months, due to sustained volatility in this industry.\n\nUDOW drift history\n\nThe next chart plots the 12-month drift of UDOW, starting one year after inception for calculation purposes (02/09/2011).\n\n12-month drift of UDOW since 02/09/2011 (chart: author; data: Portfolio123)\n\nThe average 12-month drift is negative: -1.98%. Nonetheless, the decay was dwarfed by the bullish trend: since inception UDOW has gained 2049% (23.8% annualized)... with a maximum drawdown of -80%! The drift went far in negative territory in the March 2020 meltdown due to whipsaw in the index daily returns. It jumped in positive territory in April 2021, when this bad period went out of the look-back interval. Then, the drift has been mostly negative since February 2022.\n\nPerformance over the last 5 years is underwhelming: the 3x leveraged UDOW is slightly lagging the non-leveraged Dow Jones ETF (DIA), due to two volatile periods (the 2020 meltdown and the 2022 correction).\n\nUDOW vs DIA, 5-year return (Seeking Alpha)\n\nI don't have a synthetic price series for UDOW before inception, but I have it for ProShares UltraPro S&P500 (UPRO). From 1/1/2000, UPRO would have an annualized return inferior to the non-leveraged S&P 500 (4.86% vs. 7.47%) and a maximum drawdown of -98%. As the Dow Jones has a correlation of 0.96 and a beta of 0.92 relative to the S&P 500 (based on daily returns), performance and risk metrics would be barely better for UDOW.\n\nSome investors think leveraged ETFs will automatically recover when the market goes back up, but it is a misconception. UDOW and other leveraged funds are only for investors and traders with a good understanding of their behavior.",

        "title": "FedEx: DRIVE Initiative Has Exceeded My Expectations, For Now (NYSE:FDX)",
        "body": "AndreyPopov/iStock via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nThe last time I wrote about FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), I argued how the company\u2019s initiatives such as One FedEx and the presence of an activist hedge fund may not be enough to offset the pressure on the company\u2019s volumes caused by a challenging macro environment. I had a SELL rating on the stock.\n\nSince the article was published in July 2023, the stock has gained 21.3%, marginally underperforming the S&P 500, which gained 22.7% during the same period.\n\nIn this article, I dissect the company\u2019s Q4 numbers and investigate how the company\u2019s cost-cutting initiative, DRIVE, has been progressing. I also evaluate the implications of the company\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives for its Freight business.\n\nA Snapshot of FDX\u2019s Q4 Report\n\nFDX ended the year on a high, beating on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenues of 22.1 billion were up 0.8% y/y and beat analyst estimates by $41.1 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $5.41, jumping 9.5% y/y and beating analyst estimates by $0.04. Operating income and operating margins both improved y/y, coming in at $1.87 billion and 8.5% respectively, as the company\u2019s cost-saving initiative dubbed DRIVE started taking shape.\n\nFor the full year, while revenues were down 2.8% y/y, coming in at $87.7 billion, non-GAAP EPS grew at an impressive rate of 19% y/y, coming in at $17.80. Both operating income and operating margins, once again, showed significant improvements, with the former registering a growth of 16.2% y/y and the latter improving by 110 bps.\n\nIt is, however, the guidance, especially the EPS, that impressed the street. While management forecasts a low-to-mid single-digit growth for revenues, non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in between $20 and $22, with the mid-point of this guidance coming in above consensus street estimates of $20.75. Management also expects permanent cost savings of $2.2 billion for FY25 courtesy of the DRIVE initiative. The company also expects to undertake repurchases amounting to $2.5 billion, $1.0 billion of which is expected to occur during Q1, and reiterated the 10% increase in its dividend.\n\nStrategic Evaluation of Freight Business Makes Sense Only If End Result is a Spinoff\n\nOne of the highlights of FDX\u2019s Q4 report was the management\u2019s major announcement that they were \u201cconducting an assessment of the role of FedEx Freight in our portfolio structure and potential steps to further unlock sustainable shareholder value.\u201d This announcement is on the back of the completion of the company\u2019s One FedEx consolidation, whereby Express, Ground, and Services segments were consolidated into one unit, FedEx Express Corp.\n\nThe One FedEx initiative was undertaken by the management to make it more efficient and also to reduce overlapping costs, which should facilitate the company\u2019s DRIVE initiative. It would also allow the company to better manage the Network 2.0 initiative, which is aimed at streamlining operations by combining the company\u2019s Express and Ground networks in the U.S. and Canada. Management, during the earnings call, announced that the transition in Canada is expected to complete in the first half of FY25, before \u201cpicking up the pace into FY26.\u201d In my last article on FDX, I raised my concerns about the difficulties combining the networks in the US, especially given the hybrid models adopted by the company in some of the locations. As such, I am still not convinced that the management would smoothly complete the Network 2.0 initiative in the US. Having said that, the initiative does seem to be on track for now.\n\nOne of the consequences of the One FedEx initiative is that the Freight business now becomes a stand-alone company. And it makes sense, in my opinion, to explore strategic alternatives for the business. First, the segment is the largest operator in the less-than-truckload (LTL) sector. Second, the operating margins of this segment, in the last five years, have been growing at a CAGR of 13.2%, according to data from LSEG Workspace (formerly Refinitiv) significantly outperforming the other segments, with the operating margins at Express growing at a CAGR of 4.8% and that of Ground growing at a CAGR of 9.9%. As such, it makes sense for the management to either spin off Freight or take advantage of the optimism surrounding the LTL market and initiate a sale of the segment. However, since the segment has a market share of about 15 to 20%, with the second-placed Dominion lagging at around 10%, an asset sale doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nFurthermore, the LTL market in the US, according to a report by Research and Markets, is estimated to be at $105 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $125.8 billion by 2029, which translates to a CAGR of 3.8%. While the growth rate is not particularly astounding, given FDX Freight\u2019s dominance in this market, it does suggest that there is potential for the segment to grow and gain even more market share. As such, an asset sale is not warranted, in my opinion.\n\nA spinoff, on the other hand, would be more tempting. XPO, for instance, commands a market cap of $12 billion and is up 22% YTD. Old Dominion, although it has had a bad year, down 12.3% YTD, still commands a market cap of $37.6 billion. Analysts are forecasting a market cap of $50 billion for FedEx Freight should it get spun off, not an unreasonable estimate in my opinion, given its category leadership. As such a spin-off would bring a huge windfall for shareholders, and they could also continue to \u201cenjoy\u201d the positives of the DRIVE initiative, should it materialize at the parent company, as well as continue to be a part of the growth of the LTL segment. Finally, I also believe that a spin-off would allow Freight to focus its resources on gaining market share and boosting margins more efficiently, and it also allows the parent company to have a better focus on its DRIVE and Network 2.0 initiatives. Taken together, the strategy evaluation of the Freight business would become a success, in my opinion, as long as the result is a spinoff.\n\nDRIVE Execution On Track as Pressure on Volumes Not as Bad as Feared\n\nThe last time I wrote about FDX, I was skeptical about the extent to which, the DRIVE initiative, which is the company\u2019s cost-cutting plans, would offset the pressure on the volumes as a result of the challenging macroeconomic environment. As FY24 ends, that appears to not be the case, at least based on the Q4 report. For instance, in the fourth quarter, while the company did not see an increase in demand, there was evidence of volume stabilization across segments, along with a \u201cmodest yield improvement.\u201d More specifically, in Q4, y/y declines in volumes continued to moderate in the US. International export volumes, on the other hand, registered a y/y growth of 8% in the quarter. And in FY25, the company expects more of the same, with US domestic parcel and LTL volumes expected to improve.\n\nMoreover, the company is seeing a pick-up in e-commerce, both in the domestic and international markets. According to Statista, global e-commerce sales are expected to hit $6.3 trillion in 2024, which would imply a y/y growth of 9.4%. And in the US, retail e-commerce sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2024 to 2029. This should help boost the volumes of FDX. Of course, the macro environment is expected to remain challenging in the near term, but the uptick in e-commerce suggests that FDX\u2019s volumes may not be as bad as I anticipated earlier.\n\nAt the same time, the company has hit its FY24 cost-cutting target of $1.8 billion in FY24 at a structural level, with the company able to cut $500 million in costs from air network & international, $550 million from G&A, and $750 million from surface network. I did raise my concern that the source of these cost cuts was unclear during this time last year. At the time these targets were announced, the DRIVE was a show-me story. And I have to admit, the company has delivered on its targets with clarity, which makes me optimistic about the initiative and the company\u2019s ability to execute it.\n\nValuation\n\nForward P/E Approach Price Target $310 Projected Forward P/E Multiple 14.1x Projected FY25 EPS $22.00 Click to enlarge\n\nSource: LSEG Workspace (formerly Refinitiv), Author\u2019s Calculations & FDX Q4FY24 Press Release\n\nThe company, as I mentioned earlier, now sees adjusted FY25 EPS to come in between $20.00 and $22.00. Given that the company is expected to generate $2.2 billion in cost savings through the DRIVE program, which is higher than what the company did in FY24, I have assumed the high-end of the company\u2019s guidance, $22.00, for my calculations.\n\nThe company, according to LSEG Workspace (formerly Refinitiv), currently trades at a forward P/E of 14.1x, which is close to its historical 10-year median forward P/E multiple of 13.7x. However, it is trading cheaper compared to its peers UPS (15.4x) and XPO (24.8x). Its current multiple is below the industry median of 16.7x. Although its cost-saving initiatives have become successful, which warrants a higher multiple, there are also several question marks surrounding the company such as what the consequences would be once its contract with the US Postal Service expires and what sort of strategy the company would initiate concerning its Freight business. Taking things together, I have assumed a forward P/E multiple of 14.1x for my calculations.\n\nA forward P/E of 14.1x and an FY25 EPS of $22 results in a price target of $310, which suggests a limited upside of 3.4% at current levels.\n\nThe limited upside cannot be surprising given that the stock gained 15.5% in a single session following its earnings release. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, there are still question marks surrounding the future. As such, in my opinion, it is better to wait for a better entry opportunity in the stock.\n\nHaving said that, a year ago, I had a SELL rating on the stock. Given that the company has performed better than I expected and given that there are quite a few positives to look forward to in the coming months, I am upgrading my rating on the stock to a HOLD.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe main risk factor associated with FDX is the degree of uncertainty related to issues, which I touched upon earlier. First of all, management expects the headwinds from the expiration of the contract with the US postal services to begin from Q2, and while management expects the expiration of the costs associated with the contract to boost margins, it is not certain whether that would be the case. Furthermore, there is no clarity on how long these headwinds will last.\n\nThen, as mentioned earlier, there is the Freight business, whose future is being evaluated. While there are talks of a spinoff/sale of the segment, management did not want to disclose any additional information about the company\u2019s plans. Once again, there is uncertainty surrounding what management meant by \u201cunlocking shareholder value,\u201d through the strategic evaluation of the Freight business.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nFDX had a strong end to the year, as the company delivered on its cost-cutting initiative DRIVE. The company beat on both the top- and bottom-lines in Q4, and also provided an upbeat guidance. At the same time, the company also announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Freight business, which would be a positive for shareholders if the end-result is a spinoff. The One FedEx program has been completed, which should drive further efficiency in the company\u2019s operations.\n\nI continue to remain sceptical about the company\u2019s Network 2.0 initiative in the US, and there are uncertainties surrounding the impact surrounding its contract expiration with US Postal Services. From a valuation perspective, given the more than 15% jump seen in the stock post its earnings release, there is limited upside at current levels. But I have no hesitation to admit that I was wrong about the company\u2019s ability to execute. As such, I am upgrading my rating on the stock to a HOLD, and I am of the opinion that any meaningful pullback would be a sign for investors to consider the company as an investment opportunity.",

        "title": "Zoom Video: Inflection Point (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:ZM)",
        "body": "hobo_018\n\nZoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) has suffered slowing growth in its revenues ever since the end of the pandemic in 2021. In the most recent quarter, Q1\u201925, the video-conferencing platform generated only 3% top-line growth rate, a rate so small that some investors hardly associate with a software company. However, Zoom Video is rolling out new products, such as Zoom AI Companion which works as a productivity tool and the company has made significant progress in terms of operating income profitability. Aggressive cost cuts have had a positive effect on Zoom Video\u2019s operating income profile and mark an inflection point for the company, which is leading me to a rating upgrade!\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPrevious rating\n\nI rated shares of Zoom Video a hold in February and stated as a reason for my upgrade the company's aggressive take on stock buybacks: $1.5B Buyback Is A Game-Changer (Rating Upgrade)... although moderating top-line growth and a weak net dollar expansion rate represented risks. Zoom Video has considerable retention risks but the outlook, in my opinion, has improved so far in FY 2025, mainly because of the firm\u2019s upward trajectory in operating income.\n\nTop line situation, improved operating income profile, AI Companion\n\nIt is well-understood that Zoom Video has seen a drastic slowdown in its top line ever since the pandemic ended. While the video-conferencing platform has benefited from incredible growth during the pandemic when the entire economy went into lockdown-mode, Zoom Video\u2019s revenue growth slowed to just 3% in the most recent quarter and it is the main reason why Zoom Video's share price performance has disappointed in recent years.\n\nZoom Video generated $1.1B in revenues in the first-quarter and continued to rely heavily on the enterprise market, which contributed about 58% of revenues. Enterprise revenues have been growing slightly faster than consolidated revenues, at 5% Y/Y, but Zoom Video's growth rates have hardly been a reason to celebrate.\n\nZoom Video\n\nWhen companies face growing top-line pressure, all they can really do is to question every single expense item and focus on reigning in costs. And this is exactly what Zoom Video has been focused on in recent quarters.\n\nThe company announced last year that it would cull its headcount by 15% and even earlier this year said that 2% of its workforce would lose their jobs in a bid to improve profitability. These cost cuts have been wildly successful, as Zoom Video saw significantly reduced operating expenses in the first fiscal quarter.\n\nIn Q1\u201925, the platform had operating expenses of $664.9M, showing a decline of 20% year over year. Expenses declined in all major expense categories, but chiefly in General & Administrative where costs declined 44%, or a total of $89M Y/Y. As a result, the software company saw its operating income (and margins) go through the roof: Zoom Video reported a GAAP operating margin of 17.8% compared to 0.9% in the year-earlier period. Total operating income was $203.0M compared to $9.7M in Q1'24.\n\nZoom Video\n\nThis momentum, in my opinion, can be sustained as the company enacted permanent cost reductions and is at the same time releasing new products. Zoom Video, for instance, launched its AI Companion, a generative AI digital assistant which essentially is a work productivity tool that offers customers assistance in terms of writing emails and chats and allows for the sharing of data from different sources. Since Zoom Video\u2019s revenues are still generated by more than half by enterprise clients, I believe the roll-out of new AI-oriented productivity tools that specifically target the enterprise market, combined with permanent improvements in the cost structure, could make the platform more attractive as a long-term investment in the software space.\n\nNet dollar expansion rate trend\n\nRetention is still a problem for Zoom Video, despite its strong position in the enterprise market. In my past work, I indicated that declining retention rates are a serious risk for software companies in general, including Zoom Video. The platform had a net dollar expansion of 99% in the most recent quarter, which is not great. The net dollar expansion rate is a key performance metric that measures the change in revenues from a certain customer pool from one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe net dollar expansion rate is therefore a measure of organic revenue growth and indicates by how much customers, on average, are ramping up their platform-spend. A rate below 100% indicates that customers are reducing their spending and that organic revenues are falling. Revenues can still grow on a consolidated basis, however, as companies sign on new paying customers to the platform, which is what Zoom Video has been able to do. The longer-term retention trend is negative, and it could pose revenue challenges for the software company going forward.\n\nZoom Video\n\nZoom Video\u2019s valuation\n\nZoom Video is now profitable on an operating and net income basis, which makes it possible to value the company based off of a traditional P/E ratio. Currently, shares of Zoom Video are trading at a P/E ratio of 11.6X, which is about 11% below the company's 1-year average P/E ratio of 13.0X.\n\nAn 11.6X P/E ratio is not a high multiplier for a software company that is making as much progress as Zoom Video, especially in terms of boosting its profitability. Salesforce (CRM) is mainly a CRM applications provider and the business model is different, but Salesforce is also a software company focused on the enterprise market, buying back a ton of shares and is widely profitable as well. Salesforce is currently valued at a 23.4X P/E ratio, chiefly because of its strong prospects for EPS growth. Salesforce's recent sell-off has led to a deep-value opportunity because of this EPS growth. The reason for Zoom Video's low P/E ratio is likely the persistent challenge on the top line, weak customer monetization and an unproven profitability record.\n\nIn my opinion, Zoom Video could trade at a 15.0X P/E ratio given that the platform is buying back shares (as explained in my earlier work on the company) and that the profitability picture has so much improved, especially compared to last year. A fair value P/E ratio of 15.0X, and assuming $5.40 per-share in earnings (Q1'25 annualized, adjusted EPS) for FY 2025 calculates to a fair value estimate of $81.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nShares of Zoom Video are also underpriced relative to the broader sector as well, as the median software company trades at a 24.1X P/E ratio, on a forward basis.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nRisks with Zoom Video\n\nZoom Video is facing slowing top-line growth in its core business, and I would not be surprised to see negative revenue growth at some point in the future. Since the net dollar expansion rate dropped below 100% in the last quarter for the first time, I believe the company will continue to see organic revenue headwinds, although the roll-out of new products like AI Companion may offset some of this weakness. Overall, I believe the risk profile has improved given the company\u2019s achievement of positive operating and net income.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe reasons for my upgrade of Zoom Video\u2019s stock rating to buy are the following: the software company has enacted aggressive cost cuts in the last year that have now started to pay off, and they triggered a sharp increase in the company\u2019s operating income profitability in Q1'25. As a result, risks for investors that have been concerned about the platform\u2019s weakening monetization and slowing top-line growth have decreased. In my opinion, Zoom Video has turned a corner and reached an important inflection point in the last quarter. While the trend in retention is a headwind as well, I believe the positives widely outweigh the negatives here. Zoom Video's low P/E ratio is another asset, in my opinion, as is the roll-out of new AI products to increase the attractiveness of the Zoom Video platform, especially for enterprise clients!",

        "title": "Crown Castle: Mr. Market Is Wrong About This One (NYSE:CCI)",
        "body": "DKosig\n\nIf I were tasked to make a list of the top five most valuable or important traits that helped to determine investment success, certainly on that list would be patience. Unfortunately, we live in an era where people expect results immediately. And when they don't get them, they get discouraged and look elsewhere for opportunities. But from my own experience of investing over the last 16 years, patience is very much a virtue that often bears fruit. That is exactly what I think investors in Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) need at this point in time.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Crown Castle is a company undergoing significant change. Management has been very open regarding some of these changes, though it is also clear that we only have part of the picture today. Unfortunately, market participants seem to be too focused on generally depressing results that the company has announced as of late. This shows declining revenue, profits, and cash flows, all across the board. When you think about the quality of the institution, however, not only on an absolute basis but relative to similar firms as well, and you look at how shares are priced, it's difficult not to be bullish. Although it will require additional patience, I do believe that those who are bullish about the business will be handsomely rewarded in the future.\n\nLooking through the bad\n\nThe last article that I wrote about Crown Castle in was published in March of this year. At that time, I made the claim that shares of the company should comfortably outperform the broader market moving forward. Unfortunately, that Since then, shares are actually down 4.9% at a time when the S&P 500 is up by 4.9%. In some cases, share price performance can be chalked up to random fluctuations. But in this case, the market has been reacting to some negative results posted by management.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nAs an example, we need only look at financial performance covering the most recent quarter, which would be the first quarter of the company's 2024 fiscal year. My prior article about the business covered all recent timeframes leading up to that point. During the first quarter, the company generated revenue of $1.64 billion. This was actually down from the $1.77 billion generated the same time one year earlier. There were a few different factors behind this decline. First, services and other related revenue managed to drop from $149 million to $53 million. This is a secondary part of the company, really only focused on providing customers with things like site development services and installation services.\n\nThe core operations of the company involve its site rental activities. During the quarter, revenue associated with these operations dropped from $1.62 billion to $1.59 billion. Digging deeper, the company did see a modest decline of about 1.2% when it came to towers site rental revenue. This type of sales dropped from $1.08 billion to just under $1.07 billion. Management attributed this mostly to a decline in prepaid rent amortization and revenue increases under contractual cash escalators. The bigger drop came from the fiber side of things, with fiber site rental revenue falling by 4.2% from $543 million to $520 million. This was driven by a $44 million reduction in site rental revenue caused by cancellation payments during the prior year from Sprint after it merged with T-Mobile US (TMUS) and as T-Mobile US looks for ways to cut costs and optimize its assets.\n\nWith the drop in sales also came a fall in profits. Net income for the company fell from $418 million to $311 million. All other profitability metrics followed suit. Operating cash flow declined from $606 million to $599 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, we get a drop from $900 million to $810 million. FFO, or funds from operations, fell from $835 million to $742 million, while an adjusted figure for this fell from $828 million to $749 million. Lastly, EBITDA for the company dipped from $1.10 billion to $1.04 billion.\n\nAs disappointing as this is, investors should not be surprised. For starters, management was very open some time ago about the impact that the Sprint cancellations would have on the business. In addition to this, management has been pushing through some operational changes aimed at preparing the company for the long haul. In 2023, management initiated a restructuring plan aimed at optimizing assets. In the firm's latest quarterly report, management said that they expect to realize $105 million this year in the form of labor and facility cost savings compared to what the company saw in 2023. This will be offset to some extent by a $40 million reduction in services and other gross margin because of a discontinuation of installment services.\n\nOf course, this plan does change from time to time as new data comes out. On June 11th, for instance, management implemented some operational changes and updated their outlook for the 2024 fiscal year. You see, the part of the company that has truly underperformed has been on the fiber side, which includes its small cell operations. In fact, as I wrote about previously, the company has implemented a strategic review regarding these assets, with that review being pushed by activist investors. But as that progresses, management is doing what it can to improve operations.\n\nCrown Castle\n\nFor starters, the newest update involves the revelation that changes, both delay-caused ones and changes in contracts with existing clients, will result in a reduction of between 3,000 and 5,000 new revenue generating small cell nodes this year. That, combined with a reduction in new leasing activity associated with these changes, will result in revenue that is about $15 million lower than previously anticipated. There are other changes as well, changes that will ultimately reduce capital expenditures this year by between $275 million and $325 million. Associated with these reductions will also come the cutting of more than 10% of the company's staff that will ultimately save around $100 million in annualized run rate costs, with $60 million of those costs impacting the company's bottom line this year. With these changes in mind, you can see some guidance provided by management as shown in the image above.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nIn the chart above you can see midpoint estimates, as provided by management, when it comes to the firm\u2019s major cash flow and profit metrics for this year relative to what the company achieved last year. The only one that management did not provide an estimate for was adjusted operating cash flow. I estimated what it might be for this year based on the projected decline in EBITDA.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nTaking these estimates, as well as historical figures for 2023, I was able to value the company as shown in the chart above. As you can see, shares of the business are more expensive on a forward basis. But even if we compare those forward estimates to the historical results of two similar firms, as shown in the table below, Crown Castle comes in cheaper than its peers. In fact, in the subsequent chart, you can see how much upside the stock would have if the firm were to trade at the multiples of the cheapest of these two peers. That chart also shows how much upside would exist if the company were to trade at the average of the multiples of those same companies. On the low side, we seem to have upside potential of only about 7.1%. But in the other three instances shown in the chart, we are looking at upside of between 25.2% and 51.9%.\n\nCompany Price / Operating Cash Flow EV / EBITDA Crown Castle 12.7 15.6 American Tower (AMT) 18.2 21.0 SBA Communications (SBAC) 13.6 20.6 Click to enlarge\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nEven though Crown Castle is experiencing some pain from a revenue, profit, and cash flow perspective, the company is, in many ways, superior to its rivals. In the first chart below, you can see the net leverage ratio of not only Crown Castle, but also of the two companies that I'm comparing it to. Leverage for our candidate is lower than it is for either of these other firms. In the subsequent chart, you can also see the return on equity and return on assets for all three businesses. On a return on asset basis, Crown Castle does fit in the middle of the group. However, when it comes to return on equity, there is no doubt that our candidate is superior to its rivals.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nTakeaway\n\nI know that these can be trying times, especially for those who are not as patient as I am. Having said that, this is a company that I have a high amount of faith in. The firm is going through some big changes and those changes could take some additional time. At some point, management is likely to come out with some major change. And when it does, I suspect that the end result would be a road that would be paved that would take investors to strong value creation. Given these facts, and all of the other data that I looked at throughout this article, I am confident that the \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating I assigned the stock will ultimately turn out to be correct.",

        "body": "ozgurdonmaz\n\nIntroduction\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a sports and leisurewear company that will be immediately familiar to readers, due to the ubiquity of its products across the globe. Today, I will argue, the stock is currently offering investors a once in a multiyear entry point. The stock has struggled over the last number of years as a weakening macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in China, has left investors wondering what the future growth prospects are for the firm. In addition, the firm has misfired on its product innovation roadmap, which has allowed competitors to pick up market share in areas such as running.\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 earnings released last week, the firm highlighted continued challenges for its business, which are now expected to continue its fiscal 2025. The market reaction to the news was nothing short of spectacular, sending shares down by just under 20% on the day. I believe the sell-off provides investors with an incredibly attractive entry point into the leading global sports brand. I recommend a buy given the combination of attractive medium term growth forecast, cheap valuation and by far the most recognized and valuable global sports brand.\n\nEarnings\n\nNike released its fiscal Q4 earnings after the bell on Thursday. Q4 revenue was flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Looking under the hood, the firm saw some signs of improvement in China where revenue grew by 8%, albeit from a lowered base. However, revenue in both North America and EMEA were very weak. On the back of these results management decided to lower their guidance for fiscal 2025, they are now expecting a high single digit decline in revenue having previously guided for low single digit declines.\n\nCEO John Donahoe acknowledged that a lack of product innovation had hurt the company and allowed some competitors to steal some market share in categories like running shoes. While this admission may have struck some investors as stark, I respect management's honesty as I think it shows their willingness to have open discourse with investors. Nike is now taking action to address the innovation shortcomings, with a goal to double the innovation pipeline by the end of 2025. Given the history, scale and financial resources of the firm, I think investors can be confident management will right the ship.\n\n\" And as we kicked off our multi-year innovation cycle, one of our key priorities has been increasing our speed to the consumer. We believe accelerating the pace and consistency of our innovation will allow us to deliver impact at scale, season after season\". (CEO John Donahoe)\n\nMore positively, management raised the full year dividend by 8% and on a per-share basis dividends were closer to +10%. Per-share numbers continue to be lifted by a share buyback program, with $4.3B spent on buybacks in fiscal 2024. EPS for fiscal 2024 was higher by 15%, which highlights the firm's ability to manage costs in a challenged revenue environment.\n\nIn addition, the firm retains a clean balance sheet with a trivial net debt of just $370m. Balance sheet flexibility provides management with scope to pursue tactical M&A should they see fit.\n\nValuation\n\nFollowing a sharp sell-off during Friday's market session, I think Nike is now trading at a very attractive entry point from a valuation perspective. The stock now trades a full standard deviation below its ten-year mean P/E. This fall in valuation is important for our expected future return, as studies have confirmed that a lower starting point of valuation tends to be equated with higher forward ten-year total returns. The logic is of course simple, valuation over time tends to exhibit a mean reverting property. As a result, a low starting valuation gives us upside room for the valuation to mean revert upwards and lift the stock value along with it.\n\nKoyfin\n\nA part of valuation that is less cut and dry, is attributing intangible value to a firm's brand. It is impossible to accurately attribute a dollar value but estimates can be made. According to Interbrand, Nike has the ninth most valuable brand in the world with an attributed brand value of close to $54B. Nike's brand value far exceeds that of its nearest sportswear peer adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY), which is ranked as the 42nd largest brand for a value of $16.5B. Hence, Nike has a brand value more than 3x that of its nearest peer.\n\nThe strength of Nike's brand is a core part of my thesis, that when the macrocycle recovers, Nike will be well-placed to continue to grow with its global leading sports franchise. I believe the market is currently gifting us an unusually good entry point into a top ten global brand.\n\nBritish investor Terry Smith has a useful rule of thumb for valuation and forecasting long-term returns of a stock. His simple formula is to take the FCF yield and add it to the medium term expected EPS growth. This figure will likely be close to the return of the stock in the long run. Looking at Nike, we see a current FCF yield of 4.4% and a medium term EPS forecast of 8.5%. I believe the combination of a leading brand, attractive valuation and robust expected growth make Nike a stock to buy at this moment.\n\nKoyfin\n\nRisks\n\nThe obvious risk to my Nike thesis is a significantly longer recovery time for the global macrocycle. Forecasting macroeconomics is inherently difficult but we do know the economy is cyclical and it will fluctuate through time. I believe that a weak point in the cycle like the present can present compelling opportunities for the long-term investor in businesses, as short-term pessimism creates mispricing in high quality securities.\n\nAdditionally, the firm faces the risk of mis-execution in rebuilding its innovation pipeline. If the firm fails to get the product roadmap back into a healthy condition, then it is likely that competitors will continue to gain market share. Indeed, the firm has faced multiple downgrades by Wall Street analysts following Q4 earnings. My thesis is Nike grew to be the world's leading brand for a reason. The firm has a long history of developing great products, I see the current product mishaps as a bump in the road rather than a fundamental change.\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe the recent sell-off in Nike's stock has been an extreme reaction to near-term weakness in the macrocycle. The sell-off has presented us as investors with an unusually attractive entry point into a global leading brand. With the expectation of an improving macrocycle in time, it is reasonable to expect valuations to rebound from the current depressed levels. In addition, the firm boasts an attractive FCF yield and medium term EPS growth forecast, which supports an expectation of solid long-term growth for the stock from here.\n\nI think peak pessimism has arrived for the stock and I recommend investors to buy the stock as it trades at a significant discount to its historical average. The stock is offering us a rare opportunity to buy a global leading brand at a steep discount to its normal valuation. The stock may continue to face challenges in the near term given sentiment remains extremely low, but I believe the long-term investor will be rewarded by purchasing at an attractive valuation and being patient.\n\nAs Ben Graham famously said, the market is a voting machine in the short term but a weighing machine in the long term. Nike is a tremendous brand with global reach and I expect that to be reflected in the long term.",

        "title": "Micron Q3: Good Quarter, Bad Cash-Flow (NASDAQ:MU)",
        "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) released their fiscal Q3 2024 results on Wednesday, reporting revenue and earnings that beat the expectations held by analysts. However, the stock price slumped by 6.5% in extended-hours trading following this earnings release. I believe the primary reasons for this negative market reaction are the lower-than-expected cash flow and the just in-line guidance for the current quarter.\n\nAs I have been closely following Micron's cash flow performance, I somewhat agree with the market\u2019s reaction, and find these recent developments concerning. Operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $2.48 billion, falling short of the $3.24 billion estimate. This miss is especially important considering how important it is to consider cash flow when assessing a company like Micron's financial health and future growth.\n\nWhile Micron's strong revenue growth, jumping 82% year over year to $6.81 billion, driven by the growing AI demand in the data center sector, is encouraging, I believe the cash flow underperformance cannot be overlooked. As a result, I am downgrading my rating on Micron stock from a \"Strong Buy\" to a \"Buy.\"\n\nDespite my concerns, Micron's valuation still does remains attractive, with the stock trading at a discount to their peers. However, the cash flow miss and the potential risks associated with the company's dependence on key customers like Nvidia, I think warrant a more cautious approach. The rumored double or triple booking of demand by some customers adds an element of uncertainty to Micron's order book, as potential cancellations could impact the company's performance in the future.\n\nWith this all in consideration, I remain bullish (though slightly less now) on Micron's long-term prospects. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing adoption of AI across various sectors, and their leadership in high-margin products like High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) provides a competitive edge. As Micron continues to navigate the dynamic memory market and address their cash flow challenges, I believe the stock still offers a compelling investment opportunity. Although the stock is no longer a strong buy for me (due to the concerns listed above), I still have confidence in their future, but now believe they are a buy vs. a strong buy.\n\nWhy I Am Doing Follow-Up Coverage\n\nI last covered Micron earlier this month, to which I gave it a strong buy rating. My main reasoning for lowering the rating was the same then as it is now: cash flow. In my previous article I discussed how companies that reach positive cash flow are often more sustainable than companies that are just profitable. I believe cash flow is everything. Operating cash flow is an important part of this equation.\n\nIn my previous article I mentioned how Micron\u2019s price-to-cash flow ratio was significantly lower than the sector median, representing an upside potential of 30.45%. However, after earnings, management has shown cash flow falling short of estimates.\n\nAs a very data driven analyst, this is something I have been focused extensively on. I do not think that this lower operating cash flow is concerning enough to move my stance to a hold (assuming this is a one-off quarter), however it is enough to move from a \u201cstrong buy\u201d to a \u201cbuy.\u201d The purpose of this piece is to not only explain my reasoning for this change in stance but also to be transparent with my readers and alert them as soon as my opinion changes.\n\nEarnings Review\n\nMicron just reported their results for the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and I am overall impressed. These results demonstrated the company's strong position in the memory market and their ability to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-related products. The company's revenue for the quarter ended May 30, 2024, increased 82% year-over-year to $6.81 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $6.67 billion . Revenue was not the only metric that beat expectations, earnings per share came in at $0.62 compared to the anticipated $0.53.\n\nThis remarkable revenue growth was largely attributed to the increasing adoption of AI across various industries. In fact, Micron noted that AI demand drove a significant 50% of their revenue growth in the data center segment. This highlights the company's successful strategy of focusing on high-margin, AI-related products such as High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and data center SSDs.\n\nMicron's strong performance is even more impressive considering the stock's tremendous run-up this year. The company's shares have gained 54.12% year-to-date, reflecting investors' confidence in Micron's ability to benefit from the AI boom. However, as I previously mentioned the stock experienced a 6.5% drop in extended-hours trading following the earnings release. This drop was likely due to concerns over cash flow missing expectations and cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter.\n\nDespite these near-term challenges, I continue to believe Micron is well set up to capitalize on the growing AI opportunities within the memory market. The company's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, expressed his excitement about Micron\u2019s future in a statement, stating:\n\nWe are excited about the expanding AI-driven opportunities ahead, and are well positioned to deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal 2025. -Seeking Alpha.\n\nFor Micron's third quarter, their Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 28%. This is an increase of over 8 percentage points sequentially. This improvement can be credited to higher pricing, favorable product mix, and cost reductions. As the company continues to put their focus towards high-value products and maintaining a leading position, I expect they will further expand on their gross margins in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile operating cash flow brought me concern, conservative guidance made some pause, and the post earnings report led to the stock experiencing a short-term setback, I still think long-term the prospects remain promising. My confidence stems from their continuation of innovation and catering to the growing demand for AI-related memory solutions.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nDuring Micron\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings call, management provided what I believe to be valuable insights. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra emphasized the company's strong execution and their ability to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-related products. CEO Mehrotra emphasized the impact of AI on Micron's data center revenue growth, stating:\n\nIn data center, rapidly growing AI demand enabled us to grow our revenue by over 50% on a sequential basis, and we grew share in high-margin AI-related product categories such as HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, and data center SSDs -Q3 earnings call.\n\nConsidering AI demand will grow in the future, if Micron is able to continue to capitalize on this, I think revenue and share in high margin AI products will also continue to grow.\n\nWith this, Mehrotra provided details on the strategies Micron took to improve their financial performance, stating,\n\nMicron drove robust price increases as industry supply-demand conditions continued to improve. This improved pricing, combined with our strengthening product mix, resulted in increased profitability across all our end markets -Q3 earnings call.\n\nThe CFO of Micron, Mark Murphy also noted:\n\nThe consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was approximately 28%, up over 8 percentage points sequentially driven primarily by higher pricing and helped by product mix and cost reductions -Q3 earnings call.\n\nLooking ahead, Mehrotra noted:\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025, demand for AI PCs and AI smartphones and continued growth of AI in the data center creates a favorable setup that gives us confidence that we can deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal 2025, with significantly improved profitability underpinned by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin products -Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nThis corroborates my belief from my pre-earnings preview that AI smartphone demand is going to be a key growth driver.\n\nMurphy also touched upon Micron's capital allocation strategy, stating:\n\nRecord revenue and significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025 will help support average quarterly CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be meaningfully above the fiscal Q4 2024 level of $3 billion -Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nMurphy then went on to state the company's expectations for capital expenditure in fiscal 2025, saying:\n\nWe expect CapEx around mid-30%s range of revenue for fiscal 2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction, as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth -Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nThis clearly shows that Micron plans to invest heavily in their manufacturing to meet the growing demand for their products and maintain a competitive edge in the memory market. While I am pro-investment, I am keen to see the company maintain strong cash flow. Operating cash flow will need to keep up with this.\n\nValuation\n\nDespite Micron\u2019s strong revenue this quarter, the stock took a hit after the earnings report was released on June 26th. This was primarily due to concerns over lower-than-expected operating cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was expected to hit $3.24 billion, but fell short by roughly 23.5%, coming in at $2.48 billion. The miss is a big deal for me, as I strongly believe cash flow is a crucial measure of assessing a company\u2019s financial health and future growth potential. If we assume that operating cash flow for the next 3 fiscal quarters misses estimates by a similar percentage (23.5%), then this means 4 fiscal quarters of cash flow 23.5% below estimates.\n\nI am assuming a similar cash flow estimate conservatively to show how this could impact valuations. A decrease in cash flow would cause an increase in Micron's corresponding price-to-cash flow ratio (P/CF). Assuming all other factors remain constant, a 23.5% miss in cash flow would cause the current P/CF ratio to increase by approximately 30.8% (1 divided by 0.765, which is 1 minus the cash flow percentage miss).\n\nAn increasing P/CF ratio suggests that the stock's upside potential will become more limited than previously expected. As of June 26, 2024, Micron's forward P/CF ratio stands at 17.36, 26.13% lower than the sector median of 23.49. However, after this earnings report, I estimate their P/CF ratio could reach roughly 22.7 if cash flow estimates miss by a similar amount going forward. If this were to occur, the upside potential would shrink to only 3.4% (22.7 vs. 23.49). This is down from my pre-earnings estimate of 30.45% upside.\n\nTo be clear, I do not expect them to miss on cashflow like this in each sequential quarter going forward. But I am modeling this estimate to show how this could impact the valuation potential. In essence, if the company does not miss on cash flow estimates (or beats going forward to make up for the Q3 miss) then we could see upside closer to the 30.45% I originally estimated.\n\nIf they miss (in a similar magnitude), then the upside may only be limited to 3.4%. I believe this gives investors a range of potential upside (3.4-30.45%) for them to evaluate based on their personal beliefs of where cash flow will go going forward.\n\nRisks\n\nWhile I am still optimistic on Micron Technology's long-term prospects, I do continue to focus on this operating cash flow miss. As I mentioned throughout this article, one of the primary risks currently facing Micron is related to their cash flow and the potential impact on their future performance.\n\nThe continuation of producing strong financial results and capitalizing on growth potential are heavily dependent on the high demand for Micron\u2019s memory solutions, especially from key customers in the AI industry, such as Nvidia. However, rumors of companies double or triple booking orders to secure a better expected value on their chip delivery has raised concerns about the sustainability of this demand of HBMs downstream from Nvidia.\n\nIf these rumors are proven true, and a significant portion of these orders end up being canceled, it could have a huge effect on Micron's business. The company may find themself with excess inventory, reduced revenue, and lower-than-expected cash flows. This scenario could lead to further downward revisions in stock price.\n\nIn light of this risk, I have decided to downgrade my price target and recommendation from a strong buy to a buy for Micron stock. While I still believe in the company's long-term potential, the near-term uncertainties surrounding their cash flow and the sustainability of AI-driven demand warrant a more conservative approach.\n\nBottom Line\n\nI believe there is no doubt Micron Technology's fiscal Q3 2024 results demonstrated their strong position in the memory market and their ability to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-related products. However, I am concerned over lower-than-expected cash flow and the potential risks associated with the sustainability of AI-driven demand. As I mentioned previously, as a data-driven analyst, cash flow is huge for me. Therefore, until there is greater clarity on Micron\u2019s operating cash flow and the stability of their order book, I am changing my rating to a slightly more cautious stance. These factors have led me to downgrade my rating on Micron stock from a \"Strong Buy\" to a \"Buy.\"",

        "title": "Vishay Intertechnology: The Latest Investor Presentation Looked Past Current Headwinds",
        "body": "Kuzmik_A\n\nVishay Intertechnology (NYSE:VSH), a manufacturer of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components, is dealing with challenges on several fronts. VSH is in a downturn due to a drop in demand that has adversely affected quarterly earnings. The stock itself is down, YTD and for the past 12 months, and there is reason to believe it could trend lower. However, if the recent Investor Presentation held on June 20 is any indication, VSH is confident it can overcome these challenges, and it remains upbeat about the future. Why will be covered next.\n\nWhy the bottom may not yet be in for VSH\n\nA past article from May 2023 rated VSH a hold for several reasons, even though the stock was in the midst of an uptrend at that time. For instance, Q1 FY2023 results and Q2 FY2023 guidance were much better than expected, but there was reason to believe VSH was destined for a decline in sales and profits. Furthermore, while the better-than-expected results had powered the stock higher, the charts suggested the stock was getting closer to resistance. This could make further advances difficult, and it might even push the stock lower.\n\nSource: Thinkorswim app\n\nMore than a year has passed and the above conclusions proved to be essentially on point. VSH has seen the top and the bottom line shrink after the Q2 FY2023 numbers turned out to be the peak in this cycle. While the stock did manage to move higher initially, the stock is no longer heading higher, and it is instead way below where it was when the aforementioned article was written.\n\nThe stock closed at $22.09 on June 27, which means the VSH has lost 7.8% YTD and 22.5% in the last 12 months. Nonetheless, the decline has slowed down significantly, but the bottom may not yet be in. Note how if the recent lows and the highs are connected by trendlines as shown in the chart, both trendlines are going down as a result of lower lows and lower highs. The 52-weeks low was $20.83 and it came on April 19, but the current trend suggests a new low is a possibility.\n\nFurthermore, the decline in the stock following the July 2023 high of $30.10 could be assumed to be a retracement of the prior move up in the stock. This move up saw the stock go from a low of $16.73 in July 2022 to a high of $30.10 in July 2023. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of $16.73 to $30.10 is $21.84, which means the stock has been able to breach this line of support.\n\nHowever, the stock has not breached the next Fibonacci level, which is the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of $16.73 to $30.10 or $19.89. This may suggest the stock could potentially head lower to the 76.4% Fibonacci level after stopping somewhere halfway between the two Fibonacci levels, especially if the recent trend of lower lows remains. Keep in mind, the most recent low was $20.83 in April 2024, which replaced the February 2024 low of $20.93.\n\nThe latter in turn replaced the November 2023 low of $21.15. There is a pattern to be spotted here. The stock seems to be pointing in the direction of lower prices, which could take VSH to the 76.4% Fibonacci level, since that is where support may be found. This would take the stock about 5% below the current 52-weeks lows.\n\nWhat could be a good entry point for VSH?\n\nIf the stock trends lower, makes it to the 76.4% Fibonacci level and support does not hold, then VSH could be going for a complete or 100% retracement of the prior move. This would take the stock back to $16.73, or where the preceding uptrend started in July 2022. This could be a level where speculators may want to dip their toes into the water.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that the stock would be close to trading at book value at $16.73, which is another potential reason to go long. VSH has a book value of $2,187,228K or $2,187.2M with total assets of $4,264,064K and total liabilities of $2,076,836K. If net income was $30.92M and EPS was $0.22 in the most recent or Q1 FY2024 report, then this means the number of outstanding shares is about 140.56M.\n\nThis results in a book value of $15.56 per share for VSH. Keep in mind VSH is a profitable company, which has grown at a CAGR of 3-4% in the last five years, so the stock is unlikely to trade below book value. Paying book value or something close to book value is not too much to ask for a company like VSH.\n\nWhy shorts are betting VSH goes down\n\nThe above could help explain why shorts seem to believe lower stock prices are in the pipeline. According to recent data, short interest rose to 11,750K shares on 6/16/2024, which means 9.5% of the share float is being shorted. This would take 10.1 days to cover, which is the highest it's been in over two years. In comparison, short float was 5.1% a year ago on 6/15/2023 and before the stock went on its current decline. This points to lots of negative sentiment directed towards VSH.\n\nShorts are likely to take inspiration from the fact that VSH has fallen into a downturn. Revenue, for instance, has declined YoY for three consecutive quarters. Earnings have been affected as well with GAAP EPS declining YoY in four consecutive quarters. VSH earned $0.22 and $1.74 TTM, which gives VSH a GAAP P/E ratio of 12.7x with the stock at $22.09. The table below show the numbers for the last report or Q1 FY2024.\n\n(Unit: $1000, except for EPS, margins and shares) (GAAP) Q1 FY2024 Q4 FY2023 Q1 FY2023 QoQ YoY Revenue 746,279 785,236 871,046 (4.96%) (14.32%) Gross margin 22.8% 25.6% 32.0% (280bps) (920bps) Operating margin 5.7% 9.9% 18.2% (420bps) (1250bps) Operating income 42,671 77,830 158,568 (45.17%) (73.09%) Net income (attributable to VSH) 30,924 51,472 111,781 (39..92%) (72.34%) EPS 0.22 0.37 0.79 (40.54%) (72.15%) (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA margin 12.2% 16.3% 22.9% (410bps) (1070bps) Adjusted EBITDA 91,232 127,627 199,254 (28.52%) (54.21%) Click to enlarge\n\nSource: VSH Form 8-K\n\nGuidance calls for the streak to continue with Q2 FY2024 revenue of $730-770M, a decline of 15.9% YoY at the midpoint. It\u2019s also up slightly QoQ, but this is because Q2 FY2024 will be the first quarter with full contributions from the recent acquisition of the Newport fab, a cash transaction valued at $177M. Gross margin is expected to decrease once again. Using these guidelines, along with expected charges due to integrating the Newport fab, GAAP EPS is estimated to come in at about $0.16.\n\nQ2 FY2024 (guidance) Q2 FY2023 YoY (midpoint) Revenue $730-770M $892.1M (15.93%) Gross margin 21.2-22.2% 28.9% (720bps) Click to enlarge\n\nSource: VSH Form 8-K\n\nThe Newport acquisition is why cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet fell to $833.96M at the end of Q1 FY2024, down from $1,008.53M in the preceding Q4 FY2023, and almost completely offset by $819.31M of long-term debt.\n\nShorts may also take note of book-to-bill remaining below one. VSH can still count on a substantial backlog, which should limit the impact of weak orders on quarterly results, but that won\u2019t last if book-to-bill remains below one. From the Q1 earnings call:\n\n\u201cAt quarter end, book-to-bill for Vishay was 0.82% comprised of 0.73% for semis and 0.91% for passes. Backlog for total Vishay was 5.0 months compared to 5.3 months at the end of the prior quarter. Looking at the backlog quarter-over-quarter comparison by product category. Backlog for semis was 5.0 months compared to 5.3 months and backlog for passives was 5.1 months compared to 5.4 months.\u201d\n\nSource: VSH earnings call\n\nWhat the latest Investor Presentation had to say\n\nVSH held its most recent Investor Presentation in June 2024 and if this presentation is a guide, then VSH appears to be confident the current challenges will be overcome in time. For instance, revenue growth is expected to accelerate. Revenue grew at a CAGR of 3.6% from FY2018 to FY2023, but this is expected to increase to a CAGR of 9-11% in the next five years or FY2023-2028.\n\nIf we then take the midpoint or a CAGR of 10%, then this would imply FY2028 revenue of about $5.48B since revenue in the base year or FY2023 was $3.4B. The latest financial model is also targeting gross margin of 31-33% and operating margin of 19-21%, which are much higher than the 22.8% and 5.7% VSH achieved in the most recent report.\n\nAn operating margin of 20% in FY2028 would result in operating income of about $1.1B with revenue of $5.48B. If net margin is 1-2% less or slightly below operating margin, then FY2028 net income could be around $1B. The number of outstanding shares is 140.56M with net income of $30.92M and EPS of $0.22 in the latest report, as mentioned earlier.\n\nDivide net income of $1B by the number of outstanding shares and you get net income of $7.11 per share. Apply a P/E multiple of 13.9x, the average for the last five years, and you wind up with a stock price of $98.83. This suggests the stock could more than quadruple in value four years from now, assuming of course VSH hits its targets and growth accelerates in FY2023-2028.\n\nInvestor takeaways\n\nThere is a reason why there is a major increase in the number of shares sold short. VSH is dealing with several challenges, including weak demand, which, for instance, had led to a book-to-bill well below one. There are exceptions like the defense market that are doing better, but overall demand remains in a slump. VSH might get some relief in the second half of the year due to seasonality, but it is clear business is not good right now.\n\nThe charts also favor the shorts at this time. The current trend of lower lows and lower highs in the charts suggest the stock has room to go lower, something it has done for almost a whole year since the stock peaked in July 2023. Quarterly results went down not long afterwards and the stock seems to have taken its cue from this.\n\nHowever, while shorting has delivered for almost a whole year as a result of the decline in the stock price, shorts may want to take note of the latest Investor Presentation. Revenue is seen to grow faster than before at a CAGR of 9-11% in FY2023-2028, despite the current challenges facing VSH, which, if achieved, could propel the stock price much higher than where it is now, potentially as high as 4-5 times in four years.\n\nKeep in mind, this is contingent on VSH hitting its targets, which includes growing several times faster in the next five years than it did the preceding five years. Still, the fact that VSH went out to acquire the Newport fab to increase production capacity, in spite of current weak demand, does suggest VSH is confident in the targets laid out.\n\nI do not think shorting is worth it after the stock has already declined by as much as it has in the past year or so and most of the low hanging fruits are likely gone at this point. The downturn in demand remains, but it has already lasted a year, which raises the probability VSH might be due for a rebound, especially if seasonality later in the year is stronger than expected.\n\nI am therefore neutral on VSH. If anything, long VSH might be worth considering if the stock gets closer to book value. Remember that the stock got close to it as recently as two years ago in mid-2022, so it could happen again. This has yet to happen though and with orders and thus demand in a slump, there is not enough to warrant making a move at this time.",
        "summary": "The stock itself is down, YTD and for the past 12 months, and there is reason to believe it could trend lower.\nFor instance, Q1 FY2023 results and Q2 FY2023 guidance were much better than expected, but there was reason to believe VSH was destined for a decline in sales and profits.\nFurthermore, while the better-than-expected results had powered the stock higher, the charts suggested the stock was getting closer to resistance.\nThis could make further advances difficult, and it might even push the stock lower.\nWhy shorts are betting VSH goes downThe above could help explain why shorts seem to believe lower stock prices are in the pipeline.",

        "title": "Economy Hasn't Gained, Interest Rates Haven't Changed, QQQ +40% Since October",
        "body": "BraunS/E+ via Getty Images\n\nWhat's been truly amazing (and a little scary for those of us investing using math) since October's stock market low is very little seems to be underpinning the +40% price jump in the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) and sister product Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM). The rally started out as a play on soon to be announced cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve (which have yet to appear). It was based on the forecast inflation rates would slide back under 2% YoY in the first half of 2024 (which did not happen, cost-of-living increases remain a good 3% today vs. last year, with crude oil on the rise). Then, Wall Street focus turned to the revolutionary gains in worker productivity and business profitability bound to happen (eventually) from artificial intelligence leaps forward.\n\nSure, we can say minor progress on the foundation for the market has taken place. Long-term interest rates are fractionally lower than October, inflation has come down from 4%, and the semiconductor industry creating AI-related chips has experienced an uptick in sales/income. Perhaps you can argue the whole market is worth 5% to 10% more than eight months ago, maybe the Big Tech names are worth 10% to 15% more. However, the QQQ +40% spike seems just as much based on hopes and dreams for a better future, than underlying fundamentals.\n\nMy immediate concern is this bubble-like advance (not supported by business fundamentals) could reverse into an oversized correction soon. More specifically, breadth participation issues, with reversing liquidity signals since March, are screaming such a correction could begin any day. My conclusion is investors holding 100% long positioning, with a focus on the Big Tech area of the market could end up extremely disappointed with brokerage account losses the rest of 2024, possibly spilling into much of 2025.\n\nDivergent/Fading Trading Action\n\nYou can review the wicked dichotomy in performance between thousands of ordinary, non-tech businesses, and the AI leaders below. QQQ has been trouncing iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) gains for several years running, with a split direction reappearing again since May 2024. Remember, fading breadth participation that does not confirm upside price action is a hallmark of stock market peaks over the last 150 years of Wall Street trading.\n\nYCharts - QQQ vs. IWM, Total Returns, 3 Years YCharts - QQQ vs. IWM, Total Returns, Since October 25th, 2023\n\nThat's how boom/bubble psychology works. So long as equity prices keep rising, the party goes on. Equity valuations and underlying business health become less important than usual, which exactly explains the latest oversized QQQ advance.\n\nMy issue for U.S. investors generally and a warning to newbie investors since 2009 (lacking the experience of a multi-year bear market) is what happens when reality reasserts itself again? We could be in recession soon (with falling business revenue/earnings) from an extensive list of potential triggers, both geopolitical and economic in nature. Unemployment numbers have been creeping higher all year, the Treasury yield curve is still inverted (going on 20 months from my classic definition of 3-month over 30-year securities), GDP output has barely grown in 2024, and money supply expansion isn't what it used to be.\n\nWall Street doesn't really care about approaching trouble... but maybe you should. There's been a noticeable shift in the health of market trading action since March-April, when most sectors and industries peaked, outside of Big Tech.\n\nYCharts - QQQ vs. Major U.S. Indexes and Sector ETFs, Total Returns, 6 Months\n\nWhether we're talking about a liquidity problem affecting cryptos and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) since March (which I discussed in May here), or foreign stock markets turning lower since May, all kinds of non-confirmation technical trading issues are pointing to a much-needed correction in QQQ prices.\n\nYCharts - Major Cryptocurrencies, Total Returns, Since March 14th, 2024 YCharts - Foreign Stock Market ETFs, Total Returns, Since April 19th, 2024\n\nBelieve it or not, similar diverging action in the overall market vs. the top performers (especially large-cap indexes) is exactly what has played out at past important pricing peaks. It's like Big Tech has carried the struggling masses to new heights in a marathon race, but is now completely exhausted from the effort. The next phase will almost surely be a period of rest and recovery, namely a correction in prices for the QQQ product.\n\nHow Low Will QQQ Go?\n\nThe size of the coming QQQ selloff will depend on a variety of factors. If it's your typical (about once a year) correction of -8% to -10%, holding your positions in long-term accounts might be the appropriate course of action. Assuming interest/inflation rates do not move higher, and world geopolitical events don't get worse, this may be the extent of approaching decline.\n\nIf we are entering a prolonged recession, however, a -20% drop might be the best-case scenario. Why? Basically, U.S. stocks are over-owned by Americans historically, sitting at the greatest percentage of household participation, marginally higher than the mid-1960s (a record 58% of households own stocks directly or indirectly). Unfortunately, this period was followed by subpar total returns under +5% annually over the next 16 years for the S&P 500 (SP500), almost entirely on the back of decent dividends (which are absent from today's existing market setup). For a mind puzzle, if everyone's already in the pool, the future is people leaving the pool.\n\nAnother red flag for me is the AI-bubble of 2023-24 (including a Big Tech bubble run since 2016) is looking a whole lot like the 1990s Dotcom boom (which was followed by an -80% QQQ implosion over three years). So, there are honest reasons for concern on the long-term investment front in equities.\n\nYCharts - S&P 500 Price, January 1966 to August 1982 YCharts - QQQ Price, April 1999 to November 2003 Longtermtrends.net - S&P 500 Index Price vs. U.S. GDP Output, Since 1955\n\nI will say the overall market valuation is extremely stretched, with a variety of macro indicators indicating we are close to the most expensive market in U.S. history, even greater than before the 1929 and 1987 stock market crashes of -50% and -40% respectively, over a span of less than 10 weeks.\n\nTotal equity market capitalization represented by the Wilshire 5000 index is trading at 185% of GDP economic output, just under the all-time record of late 2021. We are currently trading more than DOUBLE the 85% mean valuation since 1970.\n\nLongtermtrends.net - Wilshire 5000 Market Cap vs. U.S. GDP Output, Since 1970\n\nThe price to sales ratio for the S&P 500 of 2.92x is likewise reaching for modern-record territory, now sitting right below the late 2021 peak. (Not pictured for reference, the previous high of 2.3x was outlined in early 2000 at the Dotcom bubble peak.)\n\nMultpl.com - S&P 500 Price to Sales Ratio, Since 2001\n\nStretching the long-term underlying worth problem like a rubber band ready to break, NASDAQ 100 stocks are priced above 35x trailing earnings (vs. 27x for the S&P 500), with a valuation closer to 4x trailing sales (against the S&P 500 at 2.92x)! So, if QQQ is the most overvalued sector to own in one of the most overvalued U.S. stock markets EVER, the idea of Big Tech equity investment \"risk\" is through the roof in June 2024.\n\nThe U.S. Debt Mess\n\nWhat do I worry about at night, regarding Wall Street's future? It's the insane and unpayable level of U.S. debt. I call it a ticking time-bomb, especially with higher interest costs factored into the equation (hurting consumer demand potential, while creating issues with America's ability to repay). As it stands today, each American citizen has an equal theoretical share of $300,000 in total debt in the economy, with a family of four supporting $1.2 million in total financial system IOUs. That's what $99 TRILLION in total outstanding credit for America works out to when dividing by a population of 330 million.\n\nYCharts - Total U.S. Financial System Debt vs. GDP, Since 1955, Recessions Shaded\n\nFurther, measured against GDP, total debt as a function of the economy hasn't gone anywhere but up since the 1950s. Today, we have a financial system full of debt, built upon other debts and IOUs, in the consumer, business, and government areas of life. What level is the tipping point for economic expansion to begin moving backwards on a regular basis? We may find out in our lifetimes, as soon as this decade.\n\nFood for thought: before 2023-24, the last time total debt to GDP was this high, with short-term interest rates above 5% was 2008, going into the Great Recession and banking crisis. So, what comes next might be quite destabilizing for the markets and economy (quite a distance from soft landing hopes).\n\nMy nightmares include a period of stagflation, where economic growth stalls for years and inflation runs untamed. Under this scenario, stock market wealth and purchasing power could be stuck in a downtrend, perhaps for decades (at least relative to inflation). Don't say it cannot happen. We've never been buried under this type of debt burden, even during the existential 1940s World War II or the 1860s Civil War periods. What happens to America's ability to repay debt in a recession with falling income, where interest rates remain high?\n\nIn essence, America has borrowed wealth and prosperity from the next generation or two, to prop up the markets and economic output in the present. It's an entirely selfish pursuit, and one that cannot last forever, mathematically. Either we have to pay the piper (1) with an economic depression that defaults on mountains of debt, or (2) through dramatically rising inflation rates, where increasingly worth-less (debased) dollars are used to stay current on past debt issuance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThat's the logic for holding high cash levels (earning a decent 5%+ in almost risk-free, guaranteed yield vs. stocks delivering less than 1.5% in dividends), and hedges against your equity longs, while diversifying into some bonds, precious metals, plus hard-asset focused names.\n\nAnyway, when you think through the debt mess, my logical conclusion is the U.S. stock market should now be priced with a LOWER-than-normal valuation to properly discount future debt unwinds and/or rising inflation. What I am saying is 2024's market valuation setup is clearly not the same as 2000, or 1965, or 1929. In fact, it is significantly WORSE because of the disconnect between too much debt and too much investor confidence. It's akin to putting a peak stock valuation on an individual business with peak earnings at the same time. Incredible downside appears when normalized valuation multiples are again put on falling earnings/sales. You get the dreaded double-whammy effect on imploding stock pricing.\n\nWhat could keep the Big Tech AI bubble inflating? That's the question we all want answered. For sure, a new and overly aggressive money printing effort by the Federal Reserve could put off the inevitable another year or two. I am talking about reversing QT (Quantitative Tightening) bond liquidation efforts in favor of a massive QE (Quantitative Easing) buying spree of U.S. Treasuries to keep interest rates lower than otherwise, on top of jumping the gun on short-term banking rate cuts (before recession).\n\nThe \"cost\" of this maneuver would be quite high, however. We could see inflation quickly bounce back above 5% in the CPI measure, and long-term interest rates might actually rise, even in the face of direct Fed buying in the same securities. We could witness a major loss of faith in the U.S. dollar by foreign investors and central banks, where they sell American bond assets, at the same time as commodities catch a bid all over the world.\n\nGiven QQQ has experienced strong price momentum, the majority of trading indicators are relatively healthy looking. However, basic volume statistics do highlight a serious exhaustion issue for buying interest. On the 2-year chart below, you can see how daily trading volume has collapsed over the latest 7 weeks (boxed in blue), while On Balance Volume numbers have not budged much since early February (circled in red). I remain concerned a material selloff in QQQ's price could happen rapidly, given any bad news world event enlarges the pool of sellers overnight, while buying interest evaporates. I have mentioned many times on Seeking Alpha how markets tend to peak on low volume and bottom on high volume.\n\nStockCharts.com - QQQ, 24 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes, Author Reference Points\n\nTrust me, I do not want the stock market to decline markedly the rest of 2024 and/or throughout 2025. I like making money on the long side in equities. Nevertheless, I cannot ignore reality.\n\nI will interject now is not the time to be running for President of the country. Your name could be tied to troubled economic times for all of eternity like Herbert Hoover, elected in November 1928, serving through the 1929 stock market crash and the worst days of the Great Depression into early 1933.\n\nDon't fret, I will continue writing about the best Buy ideas I can find on Seeking Alpha. If we're lucky, something similar to the Dotcom bust years of 2000-03 will be our future. During this period, technology names in the QQQ product imploded, at the same time as thousands of value names and smaller companies declined little or rose in price. In the end, we experienced a mild recession outside of the technology shakeout. If you want, let's hope for that outcome, not a never-ending climb in Big Tech names that directly leads to even worse inflation in America (which would increase the wealth divide in America and pull our politics into even greater division).",

        "title": "A Look At S&P 500 Sector EPS And Revenue Growth Trends Into Q2 2024",
        "body": "TERADAT SANTIVIVUT\n\nData source: LSEG (formerly IBES data by Refinitiv)\n\nQ2 \u201924 S&P 500 earnings will start in the next two weeks - the big banks should start reporting by Friday, July 12th, \u201924.\n\nThe above table reflects the historical trends in S&P 500 EPS and revenue growth, starting with Q1 \u201923, and for the last two quarters shows how the estimates changed during the Q4 \u201923 reporting period and then again for Q1 \u201924\u2019s reporting period.\n\nHere\u2019s what jumped out in looking at this table:\n\n1) The technology sector still faces a very weak comp in Q2 \u201924, versus the Q2 \u201923 numbers: tech sector EPS grew only 5% on flat revenue in Q2 \u201923. Today, the tech sector EPS is expected to grow 16.9% in Q2 \u201924, on revenue growth of 6.7% y-o-y.\n\nMore importantly, readers should look at the technology EPS line in Q1 \u201923 and then read across (right to left) and note where tech sector EPS growth estimates started in Q4 \u201923 and Q1 \u201924 and then ended 12 weeks later. Tech sector revenue was pretty much unchanged (no real trend in revenue growth) the last two quarters.\n\n2) Energy sector: Energy sector growth has been negative the last 4 quarters but is expected to improve sharply in Q2 \u201924. Same with energy revenue growth, but revenue has been negative the last 5 quarters, i.e., Q1 \u201923 through Q1 \u201924, but is expected to be +6.4% in Q2 \u201924.\n\n3) Communication services: Look at the trend improvement in EPS in Q1 \u201924 for Comm Services (i.e., Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) form the lion\u2019s share of the sector). META is now facing tough comps, since the stock bottomed in Q3 \u201923 and margin grew sharply from there. The easy money may have been made for META to this point, which is not to say the stock goes down, but META\u2019s operating margin did grow sharply in \u201923 and Q1 \u201924.\n\n4) The capital tests for the bank led to a number of buyback and dividend increases for the big banks on Friday night, June 28, \u201924. Let\u2019s see if the financial sector EPS gets a bump into the month of July \u201924, as I\u2019m expecting it to do. Capital markets activity, like bond issuance, should still be fairly healthy, although the IPO market seems quiet.\n\n5) Finally, the healthcare sector is expecting its best EPS growth since Q1 \u201922 in Q2 \u201924 at +20.2%. It\u2019s had a horrid string of negative y-o-y growth EPS quarters since Q4 \u201922. Healthcare revenue growth is rock-solid. Hasn\u2019t wavered much at all, although it was mid-teens growth in \u201921 and \u201922 that has tapered down to mid-single digits in \u201923 and now \u201924 no doubt as the Covid vaccines have faded. GLP-1 drugs have really helped growth - even Pfizer (PFE) says they are experimenting with one, although they are well behind the curve.\n\nIf readers own just the 5 sectors mentioned, that is 70% of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap as of this weekend. No mention was made of consumer discretionary, since EPS slowed down from 40-50%+ growth in \u201923 to 20-30% in Q4 \u201923 and Q1 \u201924, while revenue growth slowed from high single digits to mid-single digits from \u201923 into \u201924. Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) slowdown in revenue and EPS growth has had to hurt the sector, although Amazon (AMZN) remains pretty stable. (Amazon and Tesla were the two biggest sector weights in early \u201923.)\n\nSummary / conclusion\n\nThese historical sector EPS and revenue growth (estimate vs. actual) go all the way back to 2010 and 2011, but that data really isn\u2019t relevant today. I started logging the values just to see what was \u201chigh, average and low\u201d growth rates, but Covid really skewered the data, resulting in exceptionally high and low figures.\n\nQ2 \u201921 saw 96% EPS growth for the S&P 500 on 25% revenue growth. Obviously, that\u2019s not anything near normal.\n\nQ2 \u201922 S&P 500 EPS growth is expected at +10.6%, the best quarter of EPS growth since Q1 \u201922, while expected revenue growth at +4.2% is the strongest quarter expected since Q1 \u201923\u2019s +5.6% actual growth.\n\nAnyway, none of this is advice or a recommendation, but rather an opinion. The goal through the summer will be to see how revenue and EPS growth by sector track versus the starting estimates on June 30 \u201924. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. All EPS and revenue data is sourced from the London Stock Exchange Group.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

        "body": "Macau gross gaming revenue rose 16.4% year-over-year to 20.2 billion patacas ($2.5 billion) in June, according to data from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That mark missed the consensus estimate for an increase of 17.5%. June GGR was also 12.4% lower than the level seen in May and was 25.7% off the level churned up in June 2019 (pre-pandemic). The monthly GGR tally was also the lowest of the year so far. Following the report, J.P. Morgan analysts highlighted that the decline was mostly due to soft seasonality, with a post-holiday slowdown anticipated. Other factors that dragged on GGR included the negative impact on tourism of UEFA Euro 2024, a low VIP hold rate, and only the Dragon Boat Festival as a traffic-generating public holiday during the month.\n\nFor the first six months of the year, Macau gross gaming revenue was up 41.9% from a year ago to 113.8 billion patacas. For the year, Macau GGR is running about 74% of the pre-pandemic level of 2019.\n\nThere has been some investor caution around Macau casino stocks after companies such as Marriott International (MAR), Starbucks (SBUX), and Estee Lauder (EL) pointed to weakness in Chinese spending or consumer behavior trends. However, Citi recently said Macau's more affluent visitors are still demonstrating their willingness and ability to spend. Also in the mix, China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security vowed to crack down on illegal money exchanges and loan sharks in Macau to stem capital flight. Within the Macau casino sector, Melco Resorts (NASDAQ:MLCO) is reported to have added the most market share since the beginning of the year. Looking ahead, Fitch Ratings thinks Macau GGR will reach 88% of the 2019 level in 2025.\n\nMacau-related casino stocks: Wynn Macau (OTCPK:WYNMF) (OTCPK:WYNMY), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Sands China (OTCPK:SCHYY) (OTCPK:SCHYF), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM China (OTCPK:MCHVF), (OTCPK:MCHVY), MGM Resorts (MGM), Galaxy Entertainment (OTCPK:GXYEF), SJM Holdings (OTCPK:SJMHF), (OTCPK:SJMHY), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), and Studio City International (MSC).",

        "body": "Seeing some posts here about \"What's the next big thing?\" People talking about sexy bullshit use cases for AI. Self driving cars/trucks and whatever comes out of Musk's big head.\n\nI'm telling you, the next big AI/robotic movement isn't going to sexy or amazing. It's going to save companies a lot of money and be relatively low risk/low visibility. Just like the conversational AI with customer service and stuff like that.\n\nThe next big move is cleaning bots. There is a company called Bunzl, which probably nobody ever heard of but they trade in London and have an OTC symbol. They are, I think, either the largest or longest running cleaning supplies company in the world. I forget which. Maybe both. That stuff you see in public washrooms in office buildings, malls etc., they are the ones distributing it. They are currently working on a cleaning bot solution. People think of Rosey from the Jetsons. We aren't there yet. But cleaning bots are progressing and don't have the Skynet or general safety concerns of something like self-driving vehicles. Janitors also don't have the public sympathy or union support like truck drivers would. Usually just poor immigrants who can be done away with once they are no longer needed and no one will care.\n\nThink of cleaning bots kind of like zombie janitors. They have enough \"AI\" to perform their tasks, but not enough AI to actually be proactive in deciding which tasks to do and when. They need a centralized system run by someone to tell them what to do. That centralized system is being deployed as we speak. This is what is happening in Queen's University in Canada, one of the ground zero test cases:\n\nhttps://bunzlcanada.ca/queens-u-students-give-residence-cleaning-an-a/\n\nInstead of janitorial checkups at set times, a QR code system exists to ping the centralized system whenever cleanup or supplies are needed. If you read the article, you see early results have been positive. Eventually the software is going to be deployed all over the place, then the bots deployed to replace humans. It's going to happen in a blink of an eye. I think a good comparison will be self-checkout lanes in grocery stores. There was initially some pushback, but the pushback was so weak and short-lived that people just accept it as normal now.\n\nBunzl will benefit huge from this change, particularly since the perception is that they are some backwards old school company selling toilet paper. And haven't gone the way of Dunder Mifflin yet only because toilet paper can't be replaced by emails. This change in perception from shitty old school company into \"holy shit these guys were progressive after all\" is going to lift the stock. But they won't be the biggest percentage winners. The software isn't owned by Bunzl. It's owned by a penny stock in Canada (literally trading at 2 cents). I'm not going to mention the company but I will mention that I own 5 million shares and 5 million warrants in it. I am betting big that this thing is going to catch on fire once this cleaning bot program is out. You can PM me for the company name or Google \"Bunzl teams up with shitty penny stock company out of Canada\" and probably find the name easily enough if you care.",

        "body": "First off I know Grocery Store may be the least sexy industry ever. However, the current share price of ACI is roughly $19.75 and the merger sale price is 27.25. Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins. Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction. I'm not exactly sure what I'm missing because I'm seeing such a good win/win scenario but wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts.",

I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on ____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: Fed\u2019s Favored Price Gauge Slows, Supporting Case for Rate Cut\n\nAlso keep in mind the presidential debate was yesterday.\n\nNKE- Earnings yesterday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. EPS $1.01 vs $.83 expected. Revenue of $12.6B vs 12.84 expected. Sales miss was attributed due to lifestyle business declining, and traffic in China declining. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Most interesting stock I\u2019m watching today.\n\nINFN- Nokia to acquire INFN in $2.3B deal to scale up their network. Note this news came out at the close yesterday.\n\nCHWY/WOOF- Spiked yesterday during the trading day due to DFV posting a picture of a dog. I wish I was joking.\n\nAMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\n\nWBTN- IPO'd yesterday, watching for any moves upward due to how it traded premarket today.\n\nIPO today: ALMS (immunosuppression therapies)",

        "body": "Sometimes, I see the name on Reddit\u2026\n\n...sometimes, the ticker pops up on StockTwits\u2026\n\n\u2026sometimes, my friends and coworkers tell me about the gains they make from this ticker\u2026\n\nBut after 3 weekend articles by Motley Fool surrounding Palantir Technologies, and while I look for my next long-term buy and hold going into Monday, as well as the inevitable rise of artificial intelligence over the next few years, I figured it was time\u2026\n\n\u2026time for THE ULTIMATE DUE DILLIGENCE REPORT ON $PLTR - get your minds right and lock it in, because this is about to be some no-joke fucking research.\n\nFor a cute elevator-intro, Palantir Technologies ($PLTR ~ NYSE) was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen, with the mission to transform commercialized data analytics through the power of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company develops software products for large institutions and government agencies that allows enormous data sets to be analyzed in just seconds.\n\nImagine blinking and you have a Pivot Table on Excel, except the data set is made up of a statewide census \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nLooking at some basic financial valuations on the fundamental side, Palantir market cap is listed as $45 billion, while reeling in $2.21 billion in revenue in 2023 for a net income of $341 million. EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.\n\n^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.\n\nAfter at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even Zacks.com, although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they\u2019re likely to move in the same direction as the market.\n\nNow, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don\u2019t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.\n\nMoving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX\u2019s stagnancy in the same period.\n\n$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.\n\nPalantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst\u2019s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.\n\nLet\u2019s size-up against the comp.\n\nBeing in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.\n\nNonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.\n\nHowever, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won\u2019t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o\u2019 Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.\n\nThe Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.\n\nBut the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I\u2019m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.\n\nThe Set Up\n\nPlain and simple - we\u2019re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.\n\n$PLTR 1D w/ TradingView + StocksBuddy\n\nLet\u2019s see what we get out of this squad in Denver. Hope you guys enjoyed the read and found something valuable here. Per usual, NFA.\n\nSources\n\n1 2 3",

Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they\u2019ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don\u2019t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.\n\nYes, Nvidia\u2019s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn\u2019t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.\n\nEvery time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn\u2019t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia\u2019s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn\u2019t happened and Nvidia\u2019s only gotten stronger.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say over time Nvidia won\u2019t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it\u2019s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.\n\nPlus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don\u2019t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.\n\nOverall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia\u2019s growth story.",

We should read these trendlines as uptrend, BUT we can clearly see that the overall pattern is called an ascending channel or even a wedge since it is not broadening, nor closing. This pattern breaks to the downside over 80% of the times. Though, this frequently (since, not always) comes from a rejection from the upper trendline. Here, we can see that the most recent major level we tested was the lower trendline, which powered the price to start moving towards the upper trendline, which will act as a resistance and eventuate the pattern by starting to move towards the lower trendline, so as to break it and move lower. So, the ultimate scenario is breaking the the channel to the downside, either after we make contact with the upper trendline, or at any moment, just start moving lower. To be clear, I'm not going to take some kind of a Big Short, but being able to analyze macro trends is important in day-to-day life as well. As a sidenote, in general, we take an entry when the price closes below the trendline. So, in this case, we'd take an entry if the price was to close below the lower trendline. Though price likes to retrace back up to the lower trendline and reject from there to the downside, which usually is not a problem if the pattern is one-sided enough.",

As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the dot.com bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the dot.com boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!\n\nMAV",

        "body": "Nike has a strong dividend history and currently pays an annual dividend of $1.48 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of around 1.5%. The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and plans to continue this tradition, indicating solid financial health and sustainable growth.\n\nThe trick now, of course, is to find the right entry point into the market. I help myself with a chart on a weekly basis, which currently offers the possibility of a wolf's mouth. A wolf's mouth consists of 5 pattern points, and the lines represent the signal and target areas of the price movement. For a signal in a wolf mouth, the lower yellow line must be broken, and then the signal line must be penetrated again from bottom to top in a reversal, in our case.\n\nIn this situation, it is important to pay attention to the chart's behavior. If the price bounces off the signal line (1-3) from below, a rapid continuation of the previous short movement is to be expected. Similarly, if we penetrate the wolf, price targets up to at least the open gap or the target line (1-4) are realistic, providing a confident outlook on the potential outcomes.\n\nA harmonic pattern can be used in the chart to limit the current downward movement. In our scenario, we use a butterfly pattern. It is particularly essential to look at this in combination. Remember that the situation at the wolf trigger is crucial. We can, therefore, try to confirm this Harmonic pattern by penetrating or bouncing off the signal line of the wolf. If the butterfly pattern starts, we can use another Fibonacci from the harmonic pattern points A to D to forecast the starting points of the suspected movement.\n\nAfter the situation at the signal line of the wolf, you have to take care of a stop loss. I also use the rules of technical analysis here. I use the Elliott wave correction rule for wave 2, which states that the path of wave 2 may correct a maximum of 99.99% of the movement of wave 1.\n\nThe point of the whole scenario is to find a safe entry that can quickly the Stop Loss set to break even. Just so you know, I am an active day trader and trade very actively, which means you must maintain the trade. Likewise, I am aware that if an experienced Elliott Waver colleague sees this chart, he will point out to me that the short target after the Elliott waves is much higher. This has to do with the fact that an Elliott wave 3 has to run at least the 161 Fibonacci extension. I am aware of this, but as I said, the strategy is to find Hedgeable entries without messing up the equity and drawdown value in the account. I always care not to lose anything in my trading style, so I always break even quickly. The account grows via the trading frequency and partial sales, and when the price runs through, there is a significant and profitable rebound as the cherry on the sundae. By combining these three completely different strategies, good insights and deductions with a certain logic can be derived, which only sometimes works for me too. But it's better than shooting blindly into the air. The next step is checking various indicators. One Rule of Elliott waves is that a divergence should accompany a C correction wave. This Rule is essential because, as you already know, wave two may correct a maximum of 99.99%. Of course, we also need to ensure that the fundamental conditions for a correction are in place, which is the case here.\n\nEven if they are often dismissed as inferior, I always recommend taking a look at the moving averages. In our scenario, the picture of the moving averages in the weekly time frame is fundamentally against us. Even if you scroll back up to the previous chart, you will see that there is currently no significant divergence at the current price level.\n\nThe indicative chart, therefore, initially speaks against the structural trade setup. Still, looking at it from the perspective that we are looking for a Hedgeable entry, a retest of the moving averages can appear quite plausible. If we count back 50 candles from the blue moving average, it should rise in the near future. Consider the area of the Harmonic Butterfly Pattern between the pattern points B-C.\n\nIf we now do the same with the 200 moving average in red, we can see that it is in the falling phase, which means that the line of the 200 moving average should fall. The current strong falling candle has the appearance of a so-called Marubozu candle, which also goes against our idea. Marubozu candles do not have a significant trading range and consist only of the candle's body.\n\nYou may remember what we talked about at the beginning of this post, it was about the wolf. We need to determine how the price behaves at the signal line. In practice, after the signal line is broken, an intraday timeframe is used to refine the entry. I use a Multitimeframe principle for this, which would go beyond the scope of this article. However, if you are interested, I can write a separate article when the opportunity arises.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nTrade save and be a Tradebuddy",

Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: \u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nAs president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.\n\nNow, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed \u201cuniversal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,\u201d including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.\n\nMr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.",

During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family\u2019s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.\n\nDespite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they\u2019d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person\u2019s politics?\n\nThis year, Ms. Lunz Trujillo, now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, was reading a new, best-selling book that cited her research to explore those same questions. But this recognition didn\u2019t bring the thrill she might have expected.",

The hoard of 30 million documents he didn\u2019t manage to destroy, Behar writes, \u201cis nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.\u201d The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets \u201cdissolving to mulch.\u201d",

        "title": "A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business",
        "body": "Talking points\n\nAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.\n\nThere will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here\u2019s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate \u201cbingo card\u201d further below.)\n\nThe economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?\n\nInflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they\u2019re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 \u2014 an economy many Americans want back.\n\nTaxes: Biden\u2019s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: \u201cIt\u2019s simple math,\u201d David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don\u2019t like Biden\u2019s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.\n\nProtectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.\n\nMarkets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night\u2019s debate, \u201cmarkets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping \u201csome continuity.\u201d\n\nOther issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue \u2014 and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:\n\nFor Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.\n\nFor Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.",

        "title": "Help! Qatar Airways Denied Us Boarding Because of a Broken Link.",
        "body": "Dear Tripped Up,\n\nI am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a \u201cHealth Declaration Form\u201d in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn\u2019t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets \u2014 we received $1,185 \u2014 but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nYour run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding \u201cthousands of times a day,\u201d said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.\n\nNot to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.\n\nCountries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week\u2019s vacation. But travel can be complicated \u2014 consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways\u2019 hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.",

        "body": "Investors can own as many stocks as they want whenever they want, and thankfully so. After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.\n\nSometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)\n\n1. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.\n\nMercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.\n\nAnd this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.\n\nAnd it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.\n\nEven so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.\n\nBecause e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nFew investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.\n\nIf you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.\n\nBetter yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.\n\nRatings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.\n\nGoogle Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.\n\nSo Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nI would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).\n\nIt's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.\n\nBofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.\n\nLargely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.\n\nWe do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.\n\nIn the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.\n\nIts annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "How Much Does the Average 70 Year Old Have Saved?",
        "body": "how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings\n\nPart of retirement planning includes determining how much to save and invest so you can enjoy the type of lifestyle you desire. Setting your savings target by age can be a good way to organize your strategy and gauge how to track progress with your goals. You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we\u2019re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.\n\nHow Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That\u2019s money that\u2019s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:\n\n$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)\n\n$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts\n\n$17,000 in savings bonds\n\n$43,000 in cash value life insurance\n\nIn terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.\n\nWhether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans\u2019 spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they\u2019re spending more to compensate for higher prices.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .\n\nHow Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?\n\nFinancial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don\u2019t match up.\n\nThe amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nDesired retirement lifestyle\n\nWhen they apply for Social Security benefits\n\nOther sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity\n\nOther savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs\n\nOverall health and life expectancy\n\nThe more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you\u2019ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees\u2019 income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.\n\nLong-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you\u2019ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you\u2019re not at risk of draining your savings.\n\nWhat Is a Good Net Worth at 70?\n\nhow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings\n\nNet worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it\u2019s the difference between what you own and what you owe.\n\nThe average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed\u2019s data.\n\nWhat constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that\u2019s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.\n\nIf you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.\n\nIs Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?\n\nWhether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it\u2019s helpful to consider:\n\nWhen you\u2019ll really need to take Social Security benefits\n\nWhether you\u2019ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring\n\nHow long you plan to live in retirement\n\nYour desired savings goal and current savings rate\n\nIf you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You\u2019ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.\n\nYou can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you\u2019re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.\n\nRetiring at 70 means you\u2019ll have a two-year gap before you\u2019ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You\u2019ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.\n\nWithin that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you\u2019re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you\u2019d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nhow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings\n\nHow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that\u2019s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nConsider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don\u2019t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nDelaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/kupicoo, \u00a9iStock.com/AleksandarNakic, \u00a9iStock.com/jeffbergen\n\nThe post How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.",

        "title": "How to Avoid the Social Security 'Tax Torpedo'",
        "body": "A senior couple dealing with unexpected Social Security taxes, commonly referred to as the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nWhile retirees may be chagrined to discover that taxes don\u2019t end when they leave the workforce, an unseen threat looms behind the U.S. tax code. The Social Security tax torpedo is as destructive as it sounds, blowing up the budgets of unsuspecting retired folks eagerly awaiting their first Social Security check. Having a clear understanding of your Social Security taxes could help you dodge this torpedo in retirement. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nA financial advisor can help you create a financial plan to minimize your taxes in your golden years.\n\nWhat Is Social Security Tax Torpedo?\n\nThe Social Security tax torpedo is a spike in taxes retirees can experience after receiving Social Security income. Specifically, 50% to 85% of your Social Security check may be taxable, depending on your income level and life circumstances. In addition, your Social Security income can increase your marginal tax rate, meaning the top portion of your income enters the next tax bracket. As a result, unsuspecting retirees can pay heavier taxes than anticipated, and their Social Security benefits provide less of a financial boost than expected.\n\nTax Torpedo Implications\n\nThe government bases your taxes in retirement on your modified adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable interest (usually from municipal bonds) and half of your Social Security benefits. The resulting sum is called your \u2018combined income,\u2019 which incurs different taxes depending on the amount and the filer\u2019s status.\n\nFor instance, single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. An income above this amount results in taxes on 85% of the benefits. Likewise, those married filing jointly with combined incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 will pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. Any amount above this incurs taxes on 85% of the benefits.\n\nRemember, the tax torpedo doesn\u2019t mean you will lose 85% of your Social Security income taxes. Instead, you\u2019ll owe your regular income tax rate on 85 cents of every dollar you receive from Social Security. In addition, your income tax rate isn\u2019t the same across all your income because of how tax brackets work. The US tax code incurs progressive taxes on your income the higher it is.\n\nFor example, say you\u2019re a single filer in 2023 with a total taxable income of $50,000 (putting you in the 22% tax rate for the income above $44,725). Your combined income is $35,000, and you receive $15,000 in Social Security benefits. You\u2019re over the $34,000 combined income limit, meaning you\u2019ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis situation means applying your top marginal tax rate (22%) to 85% of your Social Security benefit ($12,750). So, your tax burden from Social Security is a $2,805 expense. If your combined income was $34,000 or less, only half your Social Security would be taxed, a $1,650 expense.\n\nA financial advisor can help you navigate Social Security and the applicable taxes in your situation. Get matched with a financial advisor today.\n\nHow to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo\n\nA senior calculating his taxes to avoid the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nLosing your hard-earned Social Security benefits to Uncle Sam isn\u2019t a foregone conclusion. Here\u2019s how to sidestep the Social Security tax torpedo while maximizing your financial wellness and quality of life:\n\nUse a Roth IRA\n\nRoth IRAs are retirement accounts where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don\u2019t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the distributions during retirement are tax-free. As a result, your Roth IRA income doesn\u2019t count towards your taxable income, reducing the likelihood that you\u2019ll pass the threshold that determines whether 50% or 85% of your Social Security benefit is taxed.\n\nLive in a Tax-Friendly State\n\nThirteen states tax your Social Security check, adding to the federal tax burden. As a result, you can save on taxes by avoiding residency in the following states:\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nKansas\n\nMinnesota\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nRhode Island\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nGive Your IRA Income to Charity\n\nQualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow you to donate money directly from your traditional IRA to charity. The government doesn\u2019t count the first $100,000 of donations as taxable income. While doing so won\u2019t directly affect your Social Security tax, it will lower your overall taxable income, potentially reducing the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation. Remember, this advantage is solely for traditional IRAs.\n\nBuy a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)\n\nA QLAC is a specialized annuity that provides a guaranteed income stream later in life. You can transfer $130,000 from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a newly opened QLAC, reducing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you\u2019ll take from your retirement account. This way, the distributions from your 401(k) or IRA won\u2019t increase your annual income as much, mitigating Social Security taxes.\n\nYour QLAC has a delayed RMD age compared to traditional retirement accounts. While the government requires RMDs from a 401(k) or IRA at age 73, you can delay distributions from your QLAC until you\u2019re 85. Remember, you will owe taxes from QLAC distributions the year you receive them.\n\nCompare Your Income Level to Tax Brackets\n\nUnderstanding the income thresholds for different tax brackets can help you plan withdrawals from retirement accounts. By staying within lower tax brackets, you may reduce the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation.\n\nDelay Social Security\n\nTaxes on Social Security income can\u2019t apply until you receive your benefits. Therefore, delaying Social Security can help you avoid additional taxation through your 60s. If you can work or survive on other income until age 70, you\u2019ll reap two benefits: first, you\u2019ll maximize your Social Security payment amount. Second, you\u2019ll avoid paying taxes on Social Security. Plus, if you live on a traditional IRA or 401(k) during that time, you\u2019ll reduce your RMDs, giving you more control over your income level in your 70s.\n\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor if you're interested in building a tax-efficient retirement plan.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA senior surprised by unexpected taxes commonly known as the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nUnderstanding and proactively addressing the possibility of a Social Security tax torpedo can increase your net income during retirement. By utilizing tools like Roth IRAs, charitable donations, and QLACs, you can create a more tax-efficient retirement.\n\nAdditionally, being mindful of how your income level relates to tax brackets and considering delaying Social Security can provide further avenues to optimize your financial well-being and quality of life in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can be instrumental in tailoring these strategies to your specific circumstances, helping you maximize your hard-earned retirement benefits.\n\nTips for Avoiding the Social Security Tax Torpedo\n\nConsulting a financial advisor is a crucial step in planning for retirement and avoiding the Social Security tax torpedo as you can get personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nPlanning during your working years makes a tax-efficient retirement more doable. However, if you\u2019re already retired, you can still lower your taxes and set yourself up for a brighter financial future.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Inside Creative House, \u00a9iStock.com/ljubaphoto, \u00a9iStock.com/smartstock\n\nThe post How to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.",

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock is now in treacherous waters: Morning Brief",
        "body": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nThe weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.\n\nIn life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.\n\nSure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.\n\nTrust me, it's not \u2014 and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.\n\nThis same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nI know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.\n\nOver the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.\n\nFor perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.\n\nSome folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my \"Opening Bid\" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.\n\nAll of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.\n\nBut if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.\n\nNvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. \"In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,\" Krinsky said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nSimilar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to \"in-line\" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.\n\nAnd I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.\n\n\"When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that\u2019s a bad sign \u2014 a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\nOthers don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!\n\n\"But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,\" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.\n\nSpeaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however. WSJ reporter Dana Mattioli talked about her explosive new book \"The Everything War: Amazon\u2019s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power\" in an episode of the \"Opening Bid\" podcast.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid",
        "body": "With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.\n\nA stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's \"cosmetic\" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThere are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nMost investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.\n\nSince 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia\n\nIn spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.\n\nAlthough I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.\n\nBut this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.\n\nSince the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.\n\nWe're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply -- and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.\n\nChipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.\n\nBut there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (\"Chipotlanes\") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.\n\nI'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an \"increase in average check.\" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.\n\nConsidering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon -- e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply -- companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings\n\nOut of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nIn a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.\n\nAlthough reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.\n\nOne of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).\n\nBy comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator -- ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power -- and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.\n\nAdditionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.\n\nAt no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar 18,647% by 2032. 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before They Do (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "body": "Many experts believe the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly impact the technology and business landscapes. These advanced systems can generate original content, streamline time-consuming processes, and automate procedures \u2014 all with a few simple commands. This, in turn, promises to increase productivity and save money, which has companies racing to adopt the next-generation algorithms.\n\nOne of the most obvious beneficiaries of this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower required to process AI training and inference. However, the investing community is beginning to look beyond the first phase of AI adoption (hardware) to what comes next, which will invariably be AI-infused software. It's estimated that generative AI software sales could soar as much as 18,647% to $280 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nWhile there's little doubt that Nvidia will continue to prosper from its early adoption of AI, another company has decades of experience in the field and is poised to profit as the tidal wave of AI software adoption commences.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAn AI pioneer\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) established itself as one of the early leaders in the AI revolution more than two decades ago. The company partnered with U.S. government agencies and its allies to develop AI software tools to aid in the war on terror. Its AI-powered data mining systems connected the dots between seemingly unrelated bits of information to helped flush out terrorists. In recent years Palantir has focused its attention on the enterprise sector, providing companies with actionable information to make data-driven decisions.\n\nWith decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to pivot quickly and develop state-of-the-art generative AI tools to help businesses succeed. The company's latest brainchild is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which provides users with keen insight to solve everyday business dilemmas.\n\nOne Palantir demo video shows the impact of shuttering a production line in the face of an oncoming hurricane. AIP provides suggestions regarding which orders to accelerate, delay, or cancel, which orders can be rerouted to other distribution centers, and how those decisions will affect backlogs and the associated sales. It can also estimate the financial impact of hiring additional trucks to accelerate high-priority deliveries before the storm hits, assessing how this will affect profits.\n\nMost businesses would jump at the opportunity to deploy tools with those capabilities, but the complexity alone would be enough to confound all but the most technologically savvy executives. Palantir addressed the issue by staging AIP boot camps. Developers and executives alike can attend these hands-on sessions, allowing them to build sophisticated applications alongside Palantir engineers and building real-world, company-specific solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis strategy has been wildly successful, helping Palantir increase its U.S. commercial customer count by 69% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter. This was largely thanks to AIP bootcamps and the resulting accelerated deal volume.\n\nThis helps illustrate the vast potential of Palantir's boot camp strategy.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nThe results have only just begun to impact the company's financial results. In the first quarter, revenue of $634 million grew 21% year over year and 4% quarter over year, resulting in Palantir's sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue (RDV), or the remaining value of contracts not yet recorded as revenue, grew 74%.\n\nManagement expects the company's growth streak to continue. Palantir increased its full-year outlook and is now expecting revenue of $2.68 billion, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Perhaps more telling, however, is the expected strong showing from U.S. commercial revenue, which is expected to clock in at least $661 million, an increase of 45%. That's up compared to its guidance of 40% growth issued just last quarter. This suggests there's continuing strong demand for AIP boot camps.\n\nEvery rose has its thorns\n\nThe company's rapid growth and ties to AI aside, some investors will be put off by Palantir's valuation, which is understandable \u2014 but looks can be deceiving. The stock currently trades for 211 times earnings and 25 times sales, which is enough to make any value investors run for cover. However, rapid growth tends to skew the most commonly used valuation metrics. However, a more useful measure in this case is the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which clocks in at 0.79, when anything less than 1 indicates an undervalued stock.\n\nGenerative AI is still in the early stages of adoption, and the resulting rollout could take years to accomplish. Palantir is poised to be an early winner in the next phase of the AI revolution thanks to its decades of expertise and brilliant go-to-market strategy.\n\nThat's why Palantir stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here's Another Spectacular Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street",
        "body": "I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After all, how can you ignore a stock that soared nearly tenfold in just 18 months and now has a $3.1 trillion market cap, which accounts for 6.7% of the entire S&P 500 index? Not to mention, the company's chips are the driving force behind artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHowever, the incredible run in Nvidia stock made it quite expensive, even relative to its expected earnings a couple of years from now. Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker reaping the rewards of AI, so investors might find better value in other stocks in this space.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one to consider. The overwhelming majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal give it the highest possible buy rating, with none recommending selling. Here's why.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMicron is catching a tailwind from AI\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical for AI development. However, memory chips are a key component of those GPUs. They basically give AI models short-term memory, storing data in a ready state where it can be instantly called upon either for training purposes or when a user queries a chatbot.\n\nMicron makes the world's leading HBM3E (HBM stands for high-bandwidth memory) for the data center. HBM3E's architecture provides a higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory (like DDR), while occupying a smaller physical footprint that also consumes less energy. This means mountains of data can be transferred more quickly while reducing electricity costs. Both factors are top of mind for data center operators.\n\nMicron's HBM3E is so efficient that Nvidia is using it in its latest GPUs, including in the new H200, which can inference AI models (ingest live data and make predictions) twice as fast as its flagship H100.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30), Micron said its data center HBM solutions contributed $100 million in revenue. The company expects total HBM revenue to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars at the close of fiscal 2024 (ending Aug. 31), and several billions of dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, all of Micron's supply is completely sold out for next year already.\n\nBut Micron's AI opportunity doesn't stop at the data center, because AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) require up to 80% more memory (DRAM) capacity than traditional PCs. Micron says Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PC comes with a minimum DRAM content of 16GB, whereas the previous generation came with an 8GB option. Similarly, AI-enabled smartphones require up to double the memory capacity of their predecessors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese trends will lead to more money in the door for Micron.\n\nMicron's revenue is soaring, thanks to AI\n\nMicron generated $6.8 billion in revenue during Q3, representing year-over-year growth of 81%. That marked an acceleration from the prior quarter when revenue grew by 57%, which speaks to how quickly demand for AI is ramping up.\n\nBeneath the surface of the headline number, the results were even more impressive. Micron's compute and networking (data center) business, which is the largest of its four segments, grew revenue by 85% in the last year. Its mobile segment expanded even faster, with revenue soaring by 94% as the world's leading smartphone manufacturers race to integrate AI into their flagship devices.\n\nMicron also delivered a strong result at the bottom line. It generated $0.30 in earnings per share during Q3, which was a big swing from its $1.73 loss per share from the year-ago period. It was also above the high end of management's guidance of $0.24.\n\nAs I touched on earlier, supply of products like HBM3E is now sold out until the end of 2025, and those supply constraints give Micron the ability to charge higher prices. It translated to improved profitability in Q3, and that tailwind should persist for at least the next year.\n\nWall Street is very bullish on Micron stock\n\nMicron stock is up 72% so far this year and trading near an all-time high, but that hasn't deterred Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering the stock, and 27 give it the highest possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish camp), and two recommend holding. Although two analysts have assigned Micron an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.\n\nMicron's fiscal year 2024 wraps up in August. Its final earnings result will be compromised by weakness at the start of the year, stemming from an inventory glut in its consumer-oriented segments. But analysts already turned their attention to fiscal 2025, when they expect Micron to deliver $9.06 in earnings per share \u2014 based on its closing stock price of $142.36 on June 26, which places it at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.7.\n\nFor perspective, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 35.9 today, implying Micron stock will have to more than double within the next year just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry (assuming Wall Street's earnings forecast is accurate).

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Crush the Nasdaq Over the Next Five Years",
        "body": "The Nasdaq Composite has returned an average annual return of 11% over the last 30 years. That comes out to a cumulative return of 2,440%. That's an enviable return on investment over the long term. If you want to beat that return, you need to invest in stocks with above-average growth prospects.\n\nStock prices can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons in the near term, so trying to beat the market day to day is a fool's errand. However, over many years, there is a high correlation between a company's earnings performance and the stock's return. If you focus on companies that can at least double their earnings in five years, which comes to an annualized earnings increase of 15%, you significantly stack the odds in your favor of beating the market.\n\nTo give you some ideas, here are two top stocks that have the potential to double in value in five years and outperform the Nasdaq.\n\n1. Carnival\n\nCarnival (NYSE: CCL) is the largest cruise line in the world and continues to benefit from strong demand. The stock is up 18% over the past year, and while that is less than the Nasdaq's return of 33%, Carnival's prospects for improving earnings growth in the coming years could potentially double the share price over the next five years.\n\nWith revenue growing at a healthy rate due to strong demand for cruise vacations, management is focusing more on managing costs to deliver profitable growth. In the May-ended quarter, Carnival posted a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue and turned a year-ago loss into a net profit of $92 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Carnival should drive higher margins and profits from two opportunities. The first is next year's planned opening of Celebration Key, an exclusive destination that is close to Carnival's ports and should lower fuel costs to boost profits. Strong demand for travel to this new destination will allow the company to gradually raise ticket prices over time and realize high returns on the company's investment.\n\nAnother opportunity for profitable growth is the transfer of Carnival's vessels from its P&O Cruises Australia brand into Carnival Cruise Line, which will expand capacity for the better-performing Carnival brand.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Carnival to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 12% over the long term. If the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio moves up from its current 16.3 multiple to 20, which is more in line with its pre-pandemic valuation range, Carnival stock could double in value in the next five years.\n\n2. Uber Technologies\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) continues to grow revenue thanks to a large base of 7 million people earning money with its service every month. The stock has climbed 66% over the past year, effectively doubling the Nasdaq's return of 33%, but the stock has plenty of room to run in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber's first-quarter results show the business growing at the rates investors need to double their money. In the first quarter, gross bookings, revenue, and the number of trips each grew 15% or higher year over year.\n\nOne important catalyst could drive strong earnings growth over the next five years. Uber is using its valuable data to offer advertising to connect merchants with consumers. The company launched Uber Journey Ads in 2022, which helps brands gain exposure to consumers using Uber, and it's growing into a multibillion-dollar opportunity.\n\nUber achieved $900 million of annualized advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. It's a small piece of a business generating over $10 billion of quarterly revenue, but advertising generates high margins that can benefit its low-margin delivery business.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts called Uber a \"sleeping giant\" in advertising recently due to its large customer base. The consensus estimate has Uber's earnings reaching $4.31 by 2026 and growing 45% on an annualized basis over the next several years. This puts Uber stock on track to double in value within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Thinks These High-Flying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Headed Lower (Hint: Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them)",
        "body": "What's the modern-day equivalent to King Midas turning everything he touched to gold? Artificial intelligence (AI) is a top candidate. Many AI stocks have delivered sizzling gains over the past 18 months. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most famous example, with the demand for its AI chips helping push the company's market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nBut all good things eventually come to an end. Although analysts still think Nvidia has some room to run, they're not as optimistic about every AI stock. Here are three high-flying AI stocks Wall Street thinks are headed lower.\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nShares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) have skyrocketed more than 120% year to date. That gain isn't as great as Nvidia's, but it's in the same ballpark.\n\nArm designs semiconductors and software used extensively in central processing units (CPUs). The company's revenue soared 47% year over year in its latest quarter to $928 million -- an all-time high. Over half of this revenue came from royalties paid by customers using its chip architecture.\n\nAI is a key growth driver for Arm. The company thinks the demand for energy-efficient AI capabilities in data centers and edge devices will lead to higher sales for its technology. It's especially upbeat about the prospects for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip which uses Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture combined with Arm's Grace CPU.\n\nHowever, Wall Street isn't bullish about Arm's near-term prospects. The average 12-month price target for the stock is 29% below the current share price. The most pessimistic analyst predicts Arm's share price could sink 65%.\n\n2. Palantir\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is another big AI winner. Shares of the data analytics software developer are up nearly 50% in 2024 thanks mainly to a big jump in February.\n\nThe company's flagship product is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir's revenue jumped 21% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $634 million, fueled largely by AIP's momentum.\n\nRyan Taylor, Palantir's Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, said in the company's Q1 earnings call that \"AIP's applications seem endless.\" He stated, \"We've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP. And our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding, it is accelerating.\"\n\nDespite the prospects for AIP, analysts think Palantir's momentum will soon screech to a halt. The average 12-month price target for the stock is roughly 15% below the current share price.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks (NYSE: ANET) has taken investors on a roller-coaster rise this year. However, the ride has been fun overall for investors, with Arista's shares soaring 50%.\n\nThe company provides cloud networking technology. AI has served as a significant tailwind as organizations migrate rapidly to the cloud to train and deploy large language models (LLMs). Arista has been a direct beneficiary of the trend, with its revenue jumping more than 16% year over year in Q1 to $1.57 billion.\n\nArista CEO Jayshree Ullal thinks more growth is on the way. She estimates the total addressable market in client-to-cloud AI networking is at least $60 billion. And she views this market as Arista's to win.\n\nWall Street isn't overly pessimistic about Arista, but it's not optimistic either. The average 12-month price target for the stock is around 6% lower than the current share price.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these AI stocks?\n\nMaybe analysts' price targets for Arm, Palantir, and Arista will prove prescient; maybe they won't. No one knows for sure how any stock will perform over the next 12 months.\n\nI will note, though, that the growth prospects for all three AI stocks seem to be largely baked into their share prices already. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios for Arm, Palantir, and Arista based on five-year growth projections are close to or above 2.0.\n\nMy view is that these stocks are likely to continue winning over the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if any or all of them pull back somewhat over the next 12 months.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "body": "When Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development.\n\nIn conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split. Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStock split recap\n\nA quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors.\n\nTo rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was \"to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees.\" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares, which are available at a number of brokerage firms.\n\nOnce the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy?\n\nThe process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results.\n\nIn the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%.\n\nThe company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout.\n\nA once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?\n\nMost experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits.\n\nWhile estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie.\n\nOver the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500. Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results.\n\nBroadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium.\n\nGiven the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split \u2014 as long as you buy it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "body": "If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.\n\nFor nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAt the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe knock against Amazon has always been its relatively \"expensive\" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.\n\nChances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.\n\nFor investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.\n\nDespite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nChevron\n\nA second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX).\n\nThe clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.\n\nThe good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.\n\nTo add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.\n\nAlthough drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nWhereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.\n\nThe good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.\n\nSpeaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the \"most-chosen brand\" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest \"Brand Footprint\" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.\n\nFrom an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.\n\nCoca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.\n\nLastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Free streaming channels have become 'sleeping giants' as Netflix, Max, others hike prices",
        "body": "As streaming services get more expensive, consumers are increasingly turning to free content to fill out their entertainment diets.\n\nFree ad-supported streaming platforms like the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's (PARA) Pluto TV, among others, have seen viewership steadily rise over the past few years, a surprising development given the lack of original content and heavy ad load on these channels, known as FAST channels.\n\nFAST \u2014 which stands for free ad-supported streaming television \u2014 provides both linear and on-demand content in a single viewing experience that relies on advertising for monetization.\n\nThe rise of FAST comes as nearly every major streaming service has raised prices in recent months, including Paramount, Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n\"It is different to be 100% free,\" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer podcast \"The Town With Matthew Belloni\" in April.\n\n\"We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.\"\n\nIn other words, what appeals to users is the accessibility. Julie Clark, executive at marketing insights company TransUnion, described the model as a \"sleeping giant\" in the ever-evolving media landscape.\n\n\"FAST is easy, it's accessible,\" she told Yahoo Finance. \"You can get the basics that you need, like the news and the weather, but there's also older programming available and they're starting to have better distribution agreements there as well.\"\n\nTo put it simply, FAST is the closest thing you can get to cable without actually paying for it. Not to mention that certain FAST providers, like the Roku Channel and Samsung's TV Plus, are also distributed across their respective smart TV devices, further broadening their presence for users.\n\n\"There's this catalog of content that is available within the FAST environment that you can binge all day,\" Clark said. \"And with recent price sensitivities, I think we're going to continue to see this grow.\"\n\nContent on FAST channels can encompass everything from made-for-TV movies and old shows from traditional studios to low-budget unscripted series, short-form videos, documentaries, and sports.\n\nYou still won't catch the new season of \"Bridgerton\" or the latest episode of \"The Bear.\" But for cost-conscious consumers, that might not matter.\n\nTubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, led year-over-year growth for the network following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase in May, according to Nielsen. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive? Its average audience for May came in ahead of traditional streamers Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.\n\n\"A lot of people confuse Tubi as being sort of this passive FAST channel that is just on rotation in the background of a person's household. It's not,\" Fox CFO Steven Tomsic said at a MoffettNathanson conference last month. \"90% of Tubi consumption is [video on-demand] where it's a real lean-forward experience. People have deliberately chosen the title and watch through it.\"\n\nTubi has experimented with original content, but its bread and butter revolves around its library. Tubi boasts more than 240,000 movies and TV series on its platform, the bulk of which is licensed. Its audience is 63% made up of \"cord cutters\" or \"cord nevers,\" while 40% are not subscribed to other traditional streamers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Roku Channel, which has also dabbled in some original programming, saw a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing. That led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV \u2014 the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.\n\nCompetitors have taken notice. Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix is weighing its own free ad-supported tier in certain markets like Europe and Asia. It won't roll out a free version in the US since its subscriber base in the country is already heavily penetrated, according to the report.\n\nThe Roku logo on a remote control in Portland, Ore., Aug. 13, 2020. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut the FAST business model remains unproven. Tubi, for example, has yet to turn a profit. The long-term outlook also remains murky against the expected reacceleration of M&A within the media industry at large.\n\n\"I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,\" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance. He noted FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach than other streamers, given their lack of premium or exclusive content.\n\n\"A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using ad technology to target the users that they do have,\" Nollen said. \"It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.\"\n\nCompanies like Paramount, Fox, and Roku do not break out the financials of their respective FAST channels, although they're consistently called out as growth drivers on earnings calls.\n\nParamount, for instance, credited Pluto TV for its double-digit advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. Roku and Fox did the same.\n\nThe rise of ads on streaming\n\nAdvertising on connected TV, which refers to devices and platforms connected to the internet, has exploded in recent years. And it's not just FAST channels benefiting from the transition.\n\nCompanies like Netflix, Disney, and, most recently, Amazon have entered the ad-supported streaming space in recent years. That means more inventory and also more opportunities to better target and monetize consumers through technology.\n\n\"There's a lot of ability for advertisers to test, learn, and use sophisticated targeting that was only available within traditional digital advertising before,\" Clark told Yahoo Finance. \"That is absolutely leading to some of the growth in FAST and other ad-supported services.\"\n\nMoffettNathanson predicted total advertising on over-the-top streaming services will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023, fueled by more consumers choosing ad-based streaming tiers.\n\n\"There's a comfort level [in] that value exchange,\" Clark said. \"Even younger consumers are getting used to ads on YouTube, so it's this natural progression.\"\n\nAds are also easier to stomach if you know you're paying less (or nothing at all) to watch them.\n\n\"People value choice at the end of the day. And we have always been used to watching ads, whether it be on a cable network or on YouTube,\" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions.\n\n\"But now we have a choice. And if I can save money, I may be more willing to make that compromise.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "This 6% Yield Dividend Stock Can Help You Build Wealth Brick by Brick",
        "body": "Investors who strive for a specific investment return should love dividends because they are concrete returns you can't lose once paid. For example, suppose you want to earn 10% on a stock you own for a year. If that stock pays a dividend yielding 5%, you're already halfway to your goal!\n\nYou can rest easier knowing you have something to show for your investment and aren't entirely at the mercy of Wall Street's (often irrational) volatility.\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) is a well-known dividend stock. It's famous for paying a rare monthly dividend and continually increasing the amount it pays. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years and counting.\n\nYou may have overlooked Realty Income recently. Shares have fallen 24% over the past five years.\n\nPay attention. I'll show you how powerful dividend stocks like Realty Income can be and why the stock is a wonderful buy today.\n\nDo dividends matter? More than you realize\n\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It's a company that acquires and leases real estate. In other words, it's like a landlord you can invest in, so that you can enjoy the cash flow real estate earns without buying buildings. Realty Income specializes in single-tenant retail properties, where one tenant, generally a consumer-facing business like a movie theater, convenience store, or gas station, rents the building.\n\nREITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so companies like Realty Income make great dividend stocks. Realty Income's dividend yield is approximately 6% at its current share price. Now, I get it. Nobody wants to be down 24% after five years. But the truth is that Realty Income's dividend has helped soften that blow quite a bit.\n\nWhile the stock price is down 24% after five years, the stock's total return, including dividends, has investors close to break-even.\n\nTo be fair to Realty Income, things have worked against the company these past five years. Real estate companies faced a generational crisis in COVID-19. Additionally, interest rates have surged higher. That's a problem for REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund new property acquisitions. Realty Income has gotten a bad rap, primarily due to bad luck.\n\nReady to melt your mind? Zoom out further and see how big a difference dividends make over time. Realty Income has badly trailed the S&P 500 on price appreciation after decades, but it handily outperforms with dividends.\n\nRealty Income's share price declines get all the attention. Ironically, the dividends created big returns over time. Again, Realty Income's stock is down due to bad luck (pandemic and high rates), not because it's a bad business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is the stock poised for a comeback?\n\nI suspect that Realty Income will eventually bounce back. For starters, the dividend, the most crucial aspect of the stock, is rock-solid. Analysts believe Realty Income will earn $4.22 per share this year. That is a dividend payout ratio of just 75% based on its annualized dividend per share.\n\nMeanwhile, many expect interest rates across the U.S. economy to fall over time. The FOMC, which controls the primary interest rate in the economy, has been looking for inflation to come down, and recent data points to precisely that happening. Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which is a tailwind for REITs like Realty Income.\n\nRealty Income stock now yields near its decade-high, and its price versus its cash flow is near its decade-low. That means the stock is cheap, and analysts still see Realty Income growing its distributable cash (profits for REITs) at a low-single-digit rate annually. Investors are looking at potential double-digit total returns when combining dividends and growth. A potentially higher valuation is just a bonus.\n\nRemember, stocks like Realty Income can make you rich with their dividends. It just might take time. Investors should have no concerns over the dividend moving forward, and the stock's potential rebound is more icing on the cake than the main course.\n\nSituations like this are how long-term investors win.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "body": "I'm a pretty active investor. Cash routinely flows into my brokerage accounts from passive income sources and recurring transfers. I like to immediately put most of the money to work to generate more passive income.\n\nHigh-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks are my go-to investment. I routinely add to my favorite positions. This month, I plan to continue buying shares of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why I can't seem to get enough of these top-notch income stocks.\n\nThe name says it all\n\nRealty Income has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. The diversified REIT has declared 647 consecutive monthly dividends. It has increased its payout 126 times since going public in 1994, including for the past 107 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.\n\nI fully expect that steady upward trend in the payout, which at a 6% yield is well above the S&P 500's 1.3% average, to continue. Realty Income's internal growth drivers -- rising rents and using retained cash flow after paying dividends to fund new investments -- should increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by about 2% per share each year. That provides a solid foundation for a steadily rising dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, the company estimates it can add about 0.5% to its FFO per share growth rate for every $1 billion of externally funded acquisitions it makes. Those acquisitions are financed by selling stock and issuing new debt. Realty Income conservatively estimates it can externally fund $4 billion to $6 billion of acquisitions each year. When added to its internal growth drivers, this should push its FFO per share growth rate to about 4% to 5% annually, in line with its historical growth rate. With trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe, Realty Income should have plenty of new investment opportunities.\n\nThe high-powered growth should continue\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure has done an excellent job of increasing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009.\n\nIt should have plenty of fuel to grow its payout in the future. Brookfield expects a trio of organic drivers -- inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects funded with retained cash flow after paying dividends -- to boost its FFO per share by 6% to 9% annually. The company has a large backlog of expansion projects underway, including several data center developments and two new semiconductor fabrication facilities it's helping finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of organic growth, Brookfield has an excellent record of making accretive acquisitions. It recently agreed to buy an additional 10% interest in its Brazilian integrated rail and logistics provider, and it's working to purchase a portfolio of telecom towers in India. It's funding these deals by recycling capital. Brookfield believes that acquisitions will help drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend, which yields around 5%, by 5% to 9% per year.\n\nAmple fuel to continue growing\n\nEnbridge has paid dividends to its investors for nearly seven decades. The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has increased its payout every year for the past 29.\n\nThe company should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which yields a monster 7.5% these days, for the next several years. It's in the process of closing a once-in-a-generation acquisition of three high-quality gas utilities in the United States. That deal will immediately boost its earnings, enhance its diversification and income stability, and add to its growth profile.\n\nIn addition, the company has a robust organic growth backlog. It has billions of dollars in commercially secured projects under construction that should come online through 2028. These projects should help grow its cash flow per share by 3% annually through 2026 and by a roughly 5% per year pace after that. That visible earnings growth, along with its top-notch financial profile, positions Enbridge to continue increasing its dividend each year.\n\nHigh-quality income stocks\n\nRealty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are my ideal income stocks. They pay well above-average dividends, and those payouts should continue rising steadily in the future. Those factors are driving my decision to continue buying these top-notch income stocks hand over fist in July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Enbridge wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Excellent Stocks That Can Beat the S&P 500",
        "body": "We all want to beat the market. It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAn investment gem for years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years.\n\nIt is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNaysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products.\n\nMost recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses.\n\nI like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%.\n\nThose figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Cava\n\nWish you could go back and buy into Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) before it was Chipotle? Cava Group (NYSE: Cava) just might be your shot.\n\nThe latter restaurant chain operates very similarly to its Mexican counterpart but focuses on Mediterranean cuisine. I'd challenge you to find many competitors of scale in the Mediterranean space, and Cava might be a great long-term play.\n\nHaving gone public only last year, Cava shares have beaten the S&P 500 by roughly 100% in that time. The restaurant chain has seen significant growth as it pushes to create a similar story to Chipotle. First-quarter revenue increased 30.3% year over year to $256 million, while its total number of restaurants increased 22.8% year over year, to 323 locations.\n\nFor being such a young company, and a quintessential growth stock, Cava has found profitability particularly early, making $13.28 million last year. To be fair, that's not significant on a per-share basis, amounting to a mere $0.12 per diluted share, but compared to a loss of $1.30 the year prior, I like seeing a company focused on profitability early.\n\nFull-year guidance is looking for comps growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with net new-store openings of 50 to 54. To be clear, this is an investment fully focused on growth. Earnings are not the primary thing that will drive the share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Sizzling Summer: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Red-Hot Power Demand",
        "body": "A heat wave has gripped much of the country this summer. That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.\n\nThe current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.\n\nInstead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.\n\nDominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.\n\nThus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.\n\nTo put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.\n\nLonger term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.\n\nCashing in on the summer's Sun\n\nMatt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).\n\nNextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.\n\nThe company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).\n\nDuke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns\n\nNeha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nDuke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.\n\nDuke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though -- it plans to invest a whopping $73 billion to expand and modernize its infrastructure through 2028 to grow its rate base steadily. The utility expects its investments to boost adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 7% through 2028, which should also support dividend growth.\n\nThe stock yields 4% today, and the utility believes it should be able to maintain its yield in the coming years. Overall, that makes Duke Energy a compelling stock to buy if you want to cash in on rising power demand.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The S&P 500 Just Did Something It Has Only Done Once in History, and It Could Signal a Big Move in the Stock Market",
        "body": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) outperformed the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index by more than 10% during the first half of the year, something that has happened just once before. A handful of artificial intelligence (AI) companies were responsible. The companies in question have become so big that they influence the index's performance to a significant degree.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia alone has contributed 30% of the gains in the S&P 500 year to date. In addition, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have collectively contributed 26% of the gains, and Apple and Meta Platforms have collectively contributed 11% of the gains. In short, six companies drove two-thirds of the upside in the S&P 500 through June.\n\nSome analysts have described that phenomenon as a stock market bubble, and they have expressed concern that the growing clout of a few AI companies could lead to a dot-com-style crash. But history says the increasing concentration of the S&P 500 could be a good thing.\n\nIn the past, when the S&P 500 has outperformed its equal-weight counterpart during the first half of the year, the index has typically generated exceptional returns during the next 12 months. Here's what investors should know.\n\nHistory says the S&P 500 could return 18% by June 2025\n\nThe S&P 500 tracks 500 large U.S. companies. The index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning larger companies impact its performance to a greater degree. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI) tracks the same 500 companies, but its equally weighted components impact performance to the same degree. The S&P 500 EWI was created in 2003, but back-tested values begin in 1971.\n\nSince then, the S&P 500 has outperformed its equal-weight counterpart during the first half of the year 16 times. Even more rare, the S&P 500 has outperformed by more than 10% two times. That happened most recently in the first half of 2024, when the S&P 500 returned 14.5% and the S&P 500 EWI returned 4.1%. But that incident is hardly comparable to the previous one in 1973.\n\nTo elaborate, the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 EWI declined sharply in the first half of 1973. The S&P 500 merely declined less sharply, such that it outperformed by 10.7%. That differs from the current situation because both indexes have moved higher in 2024. So investors shouldn't compare those two events in isolation.\n\nInstead, it makes more sense to examine every year in which the S&P 500 beat the S&P 500 EWI during the first half. The chart below accomplishes that. It shows the extent of the S&P 500's outperformance in the first half, and it shows the S&P 500's return over the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear S&P 500 First-Half Outperformance S&P 500 12-Month Return 1972 2.7% (2.7%) 1973 10.7% (17.5%) 1984 2.1% 25.4% 1990 2.5% 3.7% 1995 1.2% 23.1% 1996 0.5% 32% 1997 4% 28.1% 1998 6.2% 21.1% 2000 0.5% (15.8%) 2012 1.3% 17.9% 2015 0.5% 1.7% 2017 1.2% 12.2% 2018 0.9% 8.2% 2020 7.7% 38.6% 2023 9.9% 22.7% Median 17.9%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown, when the S&P 500 has outperformed its equal-weight counterpart during the first half of a year, it returned a median of 17.9% during the next 12 months. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but history implies significant upside in the S&P 500 -- nearly 18% -- through June 2025.\n\nArtificial intelligence stocks are not in a dot-com-like bubble\n\nSome analysts have described the recent surge in artificial intelligence stocks, especially chipmaker Nvidia, as a \"stock market bubble.\" Some have even compared the current market environment to the dot-com bubble, an event that ultimately cut the technology sector to ribbons.\n\nNeil Shearing at Capital Economics recently said, \"Enthusiasm around AI has all the hallmarks of an inflating bubble.\" Colleagues Diana Iovanel and James Reilly added: \"We suspect the bubble will ultimately burst beyond the end of next year, causing a correction in valuations. After all, this dynamic played out around both the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s and the Great Crash of 1929.\"\n\nInvestors should avoid thinking along those lines. The current environment -- that is to say, the AI euphoria that has arisen since the launch of ChatGPT -- bears only a superficial resemblance to the dot-com bubble. There are two important distinctions.\n\nFirst, the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 surged 270% during the 18 months leading up to March 2000. At that point, the index reversed course and plunged 80% in about two years. That differs dramatically from the recent AI-fueled rally. The Nasdaq-100 has advanced just 80% over the past 18 months.\n\nSecond, the seven largest Nasdaq-100 stocks traded at an average valuation of 80 times earnings in March 2000, according to Capital Group. Again, that differs dramatically from the current situation. The seven largest Nasdaq-100 stocks currently trade at an average valuation of 46 times earnings.\n\nI am not saying every AI stock is fairly valued, nor am I saying the excitement surrounding AI will drive the stock market higher indefinitely. Technology often follows the Gartner Hype Cycle, which stipulates that (1) irrational excitement first pushes stocks too high, (2) irrational pessimism then drags stocks too low, and (3) reasonable expectations final set stocks on a gradual upward trajectory.\n\nHere's the bottom line: History says the S&P 500 will advance 18% over the next year, but there is no guarantee that will happen. Wall Street could become disenchanted with AI stocks tomorrow and the S&P 500 could decline sharply if other concerns, such as valuations or the economy, steal focus.\n\nHowever, no matter which way the winds blow in the coming months, I don't believe the current market environment is similar to the dot-com bubble. And AI is not an overhyped phenomenon destined to disappoint. Instead, it will create tremendous wealth for patient investors. To quote UBS analysts, \"AI will be the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Led the Market Higher in the First Half of 2024, but Another \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is Poised to Power the Market in the Second Half",
        "body": "The first half of 2024 has been a strong one for the stock market, and the clear leader driving that growth has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock of the chipmaker has been on a meteoric rise over the past five years and that momentum continued into the first half of 2024 with the stock up over 150%.\n\nWith the first half of the year now behind us, though, it is time to look for a stock that can potentially help power the market higher in the second half. One candidate is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nAll about AI\n\nThe biggest trend in the market in the first half of 2024 was clearly artificial intelligence (AI). Not long ago considered a nascent technology, AI certainly hit the mainstream early this year with numerous tech companies beginning to offer AI-powered features in their products.\n\nThe biggest early beneficiary of this technological shift has been Nvidia, whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are used to build out the infrastructure needed to run AI training and inference. With AI taking off and companies rushing to introduce AI solutions, demand for Nvidia chips has outstripped supply as the company has worked with its manufacturing partners to expand production capacity quickly.\n\nThis has led to explosive growth from the company to start the year, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% to $26 billion.\n\nWhy Alphabet could lead the market higher\n\nAI infrastructure was the dominant theme in the first half of the year. But it may be Nvidia's cloud computing customers that help lead the market higher in the second half. The three large cloud computer companies of Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have all benefited from the rise of AI thus far, but they still have a lot more potential growth coming down the road.\n\nOf the three companies, the one I like the most is Alphabet for a few reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that with the smallest cloud segment of the three, it has some of the best earnings growth potential. The cloud computing business has a lot of high fixed costs associated with it, so companies need to reach a certain level of scale before they become profitable. However, once they do, the operating leverage of the business model starts to kick in and profitability growth will outpace revenue growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud just recently hit this scale and turned profitable last year. As such, the segment should see strong profitability growth in both the second half of this year as well as in future years.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSecond, while there have been some kinks with the company introducing new AI overlays with its search results, there is some solid potential for the company in this area. Alphabet traditionally only served up link-based ads on about 20% of its search results and only gets paid when those links get clicks. However, the company is already testing new ad formats both with its AI overlays and well as new AI-powered formats for retailers. With 80% of its search results previously not monetized, this offers a huge potential upside in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is also the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 25. Given this, in addition to its growth prospects, the stock also has the potential to expand its multiples (which is simply when its P/E ratio and other valuation metrics move higher). That sets the stock up for a strong potential performance in the back half of this year.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile I still wouldn't count out Nvidia as leading the market once again in the second half of the year just given how much momentum it is seeing in its business, I think Alphabet is a strong candidate to lead the market forward the rest of this year.\n\nLuckily for investors, you don't have to choose just one and can own both Nvidia and Alphabet. Both continue to have bright long-term futures.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Bond traders are bracing for a similar outcome, with the yield discount of 10-year notes over two-year securities shrinking the most since January last week.\n\n\u201cThere has been a clear relative shift in the probabilities of President Trump winning over President Biden\u201d since the debate, Morgan Stanley strategists including Matthew Hornbach and Guneet Dhingra wrote in the note. \u201cThe sharp shift of probabilities in favor of President Trump may be a unique catalyst that makes curve steepeners attractive.\u201d\n\nThe recalibration in bets may complicate the outlook for the US government bond market after it capped a two-month winning streak last week. Traders are pricing in the risk of slower growth and faster inflation as Trump has vowed to deport undocumented immigrants and ramped up threats of increased tariffs against China.\n\n\u201cThe market now has to contend with rising probabilities of changes in immigration and tariff policies in an economy where growth has already been cooling, making the market more likely\u201d to price in more US interest-rate cuts, the strategists wrote. \u201cHigher prospects of a Republican sweep, amid growing focus on deficits, could put upward pressure on long-end term premiums.\u201d\n\nThe strategists recommended adding two-year/20-year steepeners in Treasuries.\n\nHigher tariffs and the possible deportation of migrants would both be negative for US economic growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a presentation last month. The hit to the economy would likely encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, reducing short-term yields.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that immigration will generate a $7 trillion boost to gross domestic product over the next decade.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would raise costs for consumers and weigh on American businesses. Faster inflation would be bad news for longer-maturity debt as it diminishes the value of their fixed payments over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe outcome of the presidential debate has triggered a flurry of calls from analysts on how to position for a Trump victory. For its part, Barclays Plc is recommending that investors buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.\n\nNomura Securities Co.\u2019s Naokazu Koshimizu sees a Trump administration favoring fiscal expansion and a weak dollar. This, along with the preference for a dovish Federal Reserve chair, would lead to a steeper US yield curve.\n\n\u201cIt would be difficult to cover the fiscal expansion in the event of a Trump administration with additional tariffs alone, and the possibility of issuing more bonds will increase,\u201d the Nomura senior rates strategist wrote in a note Monday. \u201cIf inflation flares up again and the Fed policy rate remains high, an increase in interest payments is also expected to lead to a wider fiscal deficit.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Morgan Stanley economist\u2019 views in seventh paragraph, CBO\u2019s estimates in eighth paragraph and background in ninth paragraph.

        "title": "2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Left and Right: Could They Be Smart Buys for You in July?",
        "body": "If you're an investor who doesn't already have access to billions in capital, you could probably learn a few things from the folks who do. Luckily, keeping tabs on the world's most successful investors isn't very hard to do.\n\nEvery three months, people managing a portfolio worth $100 million or more have to report their trading activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A quick look at the latest disclosures shows a handful of billionaire investors bought millions of shares of two dividend-paying stocks that currently offer ultra-high yields.\n\nShares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) offer yields that are several times the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, stocks rarely offer yields this high unless there's a good reason to worry about their ability to maintain their payout.\n\nLet's look at their recent performance to find out if following the lead of billionaire fund managers makes sense for your portfolio.\n\nAnnaly Capital\n\nAnnaly Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) instead of real estate. It earns a living in the margins between its short-term borrowing expenses and the interest it receives from the hopefully higher-yielding MBS in its portfolio.\n\nAt recent prices, Annaly shares offer a mind-blowing 13.6% yield. The enormous yield is attracting funds run by billionaires. Citadel Advisors, which is run by Ken Griffin, and Millennium Management, which is run by Israel Englander, bought shares in the first quarter.\n\nAnnaly Capital doesn't own real estate, so it has to use its MBS portfolio to secure loans. It doesn't happen often, but from time to time, the value of its MBS can dip. When this happens, lenders demand more capital, and the company can end up selling off portions of its portfolio at fire sale prices.\n\nNLY Dividend Chart\n\nBefore you jump up to fill your portfolio with shares of Annaly Capital, it's important to realize the company has lowered its dividend by 45.8% since 2019. Investors who bought the stock and reinvested all the dividends have gained only about 39% over the past decade.\n\nWhile there's a good chance that buying Annaly Capital now and holding over the long run also leads to positive gains, the unpredictability of its dividend makes it a bad choice for most income-seeking investors.\n\nPfizer\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma bought 18.9 million shares of Pfizer. The stock has fallen by more than half since its peak in late 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nPfizer's been dropping because record-breaking sales of its COVID-19-related products evaporated faster than the market expected. Now that the worst is over, though, the stock looks like a terrific bargain.\n\nPfizer's stock dropped, but the company still raised its dividend payout for the 15th consecutive year last December. The stock offers a 6.2% yield at recent prices, which is about 4.6 times more than you'd receive from the average dividend payer in the S&P 500.\n\nAt recent prices, you can buy Pfizer for around 11.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a reasonable valuation for a business you expect to grow at a snail's pace. A look at this drugmaker's recent performance and forward outlook suggests it will grow much faster than the market is expecting.\n\nPfizer invested heaps of COVID-19-related profits into new drugs, many of which are already on the market. If we exclude COVID-19-related sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, first-quarter sales rose 11% year over year.\n\nPfizer has the longest list of innovative new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, and it's still growing relatively quickly. The FDA approved nine new medicines from the company in 2023, and they're poised to drive growth in the decade ahead. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio looks like a relatively safe way for income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Annaly Capital Management wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 70% and 230%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June, and fellow chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July. Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.\n\nIndeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\nBeth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.\n\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\nNvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.\n\nNvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.\n\nNvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.\n\nNvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, \"The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.\n\nPersonally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\nBroadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips\n\nBroadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.\n\nBroadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, \"Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.\"\n\nBroadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.\n\nBroadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- European stocks snapped a four-day losing streak and the euro strengthened as investors took French election results as a sign that the nation may be headed for political gridlock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders interpreted the first round of voting as an indication that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party faces a tougher-than-expected road to an absolute majority, meaning there\u2019s a smaller chance of policymakers being able to enact extreme policies that would rattle financial markets. The 10-year spread on French-German debt narrowed to a two-week low.\n\n\u201cMarkets are quite content there\u2019s no apparent absolute majority,\u201d said Claudia Panseri, chief investment officer for France at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cThe most extreme scenarios for the spread have been excluded.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s CAC 40 Index jumped as much as 2.8% before retracing some gains. Banking stocks led the advance in Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 Index, as French lenders Societe Generale SA, BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA all surged by more than 5%. The euro climbed to its strongest level since mid June.\n\nBeyond Europe, US equity futures were little changed and Asian stocks posted small gains. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. rose 6.3% in US premarket trading after Boeing Co. agreed to buy back the supplier in an all-stock deal that values it at $4.7 billion.\n\nFrance\u2019s second round of voting will be held on July 7. The French political world is now embarking on a period of horse-trading. In constituencies where three people qualified for the runoffs, the third-placed candidate can withdraw to boost the chances of another mainstream party defeating the far right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that you\u2019ve got a good outcome,\u201d Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at Bank of America, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cMaybe you block a majority by the hard right. But in the best-case scenario, you get a hung parliament. That effectively means very little decision making, no ability to deal with a very wide budget deficit, and also the European integration story effectively put on hold.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as US investors prepare for the second-quarter reporting season, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said Corporate America faces the highest earnings bar in almost three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSingle-stock analysts predict profits at S&P 500 firms rose 9% on average in the April-June period \u2014 the biggest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2021, Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of earnings-per-share beats is likely to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,\u201d Kostin said. \u201cWe expect the outperformance \u2018reward\u2019 for stocks beating estimates will be smaller than average again this quarter.\u201d\n\nIn emerging markets, South African assets rallied after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new cabinet that includes members of the opposition Democratic Alliance, considered business-friendly by investors.\n\nIn commodities, oil rose as traders assessed economic outlook and geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East. Iron ore rose amid tentative signs of recovery in China\u2019s steel-intensive property market, and speculation that Beijing could do more to support the sector.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nUS construction spending, ISM Manufacturing, Monday\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Monday\n\nBundesbank President Joachim Nagel speaks, Monday\n\nRBA issues minutes of June policy meeting, Tuesday\n\nSouth Korea CPI, Tuesday\n\nEurozone CPI, unemployment, Tuesday\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell speaks, Tuesday\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Tuesday\n\nAustralia retail sales, Wednesday\n\nChina Caixin services PMI, Wednesday\n\nEurozone S&P Global Eurozone Services PMI, PPI, Wednesday\n\nPoland rate decision, Wednesday\n\nUS FOMC minutes, ISM Services, factory orders, trade, initial jobless claims, durable goods, Wednesday\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Wednesday\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, Wednesday\n\nSweden\u2019s Riksbank issues minutes of June meeting, Wednesday\n\nAustralia trade, Thursday\n\nUK general election, Thursday\n\nEuropean Union provisional tariffs on China EVs set to be introduced, Thursday\n\nECB publishes account of June\u2019s policy meeting, Thursday\n\nUS Independence Day holiday, Thursday\n\nThailand CPI, international reserves, Friday\n\nEurozone retail sales, Friday\n\nFrance trade, industrial production, Friday\n\nGermany industrial production, Friday\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Friday\n\nCanada unemployment, Friday\n\nUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, Friday\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4% as of 11:21 a.m. London time\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 0.1%\n\nNasdaq 100 futures were little changed\n\nFutures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2%\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.1%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed\n\nThe euro rose 0.4% to $1.0752\n\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 161.10 per dollar\n\nThe offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2975 per dollar\n\nThe British pound rose 0.2% to $1.2667\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin rose 1.5% to $62,820.84\n\nEther rose 1.6% to $3,472.15\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 4.41%\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 2.57%\n\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield advanced five basis points to 4.22%\n\nCommodities\n\nBrent crude rose 0.3% to $85.25 a barrel\n\nSpot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Spousal Social Security Benefits: 3 Things All Retired Couples Should Know",
        "body": "Married couples share nearly everything -- food, homes, vacations, and more. In some cases, they can even share Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nThe Social Security program has included spousal benefits since its beginning in the 1930s. Here are three things all retired couples should know about spousal Social Security benefits.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Eligibility requirements for spousal benefits\n\nCan you receive Social Security retirement benefits based on your spouse's work record? Only if you meet specific eligibility requirements.\n\nFirst, you usually must be married to your spouse for at least one year before you can receive Social Security spousal benefits. This doesn't apply, however, if you are the parent of your spouse's child. Ex-spouses may also be eligible for spousal benefits if they were married for at least 10 years.\n\nSecond, you'll need to be at least 62 years old to claim spousal benefits with a couple of exceptions. If you provide care for a child age 16 or younger, the age requirement is waived. That's also the case if you provide care for a child age 17 or older with a disability who is entitled to receive Social Security dependent benefits based on your spouse's record.\n\nThird, your spousal benefit can't be higher than the amount you'd receive based on your own earnings history. If it isn't, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay you based on your own work record rather than your spouse's.\n\n2. Potential spousal benefit amount\n\nThe maximum spousal benefit is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the amount of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at their full retirement age. For anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.\n\nSpouses won't receive this maximum benefit, though, if they begin collecting benefits before their own full retirement age. The Social Security early retirement penalty will be imposed with benefits reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month up to 36 months before reaching full retirement age and five-twelfths of 1% for each month before then. However, if a spouse is providing care for a qualifying child, the spousal benefit won't be reduced.\n\nNote that the spousal benefit isn't based on when the higher-earning spouse begins collecting retirement benefits. If this spouse retires early or holds off until age 70, it won't change the amount of the spousal benefit. However, it would impact the survivor's benefit if he or she dies.\n\n3. Deemed filing\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made an important change often referred to as the \"deemed filing\" rule that affects Social Security spousal benefits. Deemed filing means when individuals file for spousal benefits, they also must file simultaneously for their own retirement benefits. In the past, people could file for spousal benefits before reaching their full retirement age but hold off on filing for their own retirement benefits until they reached full retirement age.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the deemed filing rule doesn't apply if you receive spousal benefits because you're providing care for your retired spouse's qualifying child. It also doesn't apply to survivor benefits. If your spouse dies, you can begin receiving Social Security survivor benefits without filing for your retirement benefit.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

        "body": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.\n\nConstruction workers work on a new building partly covered with a large US flag on Sept. 25, 2013, in Los Angeles. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) (FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Survey details 'stark differences' between younger and older wealthy investors",
        "body": "Bank of America Private Bank\u2019s biennial survey of wealthy Americans revealed a generational divide in the perceived greatest opportunities for asset investment and growth.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was some stark differences in approaches to investing and mindset toward overall investing,\u201d Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nMarket research company Escalent surveyed 1,007 high-net-worth Americans on behalf of Bank of America Private Bank. The respondents, who were divided into a younger cohort (ages 21 to 43) and an older cohort (44 and older), had a minimum of $3 million in investable assets apart from their primary residence.\n\n(Source: 2024 Bank of America Private Bank Study of Wealthy Americans)\n\nHere's what Bank of America discovered about the younger investors surveyed:\n\n47% of the younger cohort's portfolios are invested in stocks and bonds. That's much lower than the older cohort (74%).\n\nMore younger investors are invested in alternative assets than older investors, and almost all of the younger cohort (93%) said they plan to allocate more to alternatives in the next few years.\n\nNearly half (49%) of the young cohort own cryptocurrencies, and 38% expressed some interest. Behind real estate, this cohort ranked crypto as the top area for opportunity.\n\n45% of the younger cohort own physical gold as an asset, and another 45% said they are interested in owning it.\n\nDifferences in financial outlooks drove the disparities in investment allocations and where investors perceive opportunities to be.\n\nNotably, over 70% of younger wealthy investors no longer think it's possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing exclusively in a mix of stocks and bonds. In contrast, only 28% of older investors share that view.\n\nBank of America\n\nYounger investors' skepticism over traditional investments comes as the stock market has ripped higher in 2024. As Myles Udland wrote this week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 42% since the beginning of 2023, pacing an annualized rate of return near 26%, or almost three times the average 10% yearly return of the index over time.\n\nHowever, Pelzar saw this difference in viewpoint as \u201csomewhat understandable,\u201d citing the turbulence the younger generation has experienced in their investing lives.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation has seen in their investing lives two market crashes \u2026 and then over the course of the last few years, they\u2019ve seen an increasing correlation between stocks and bonds,\u201d Pelzar said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really colored their thinking around how they need to allocate assets in order to generate the returns they look for.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nA fan at the 150th running of the Kentucky Oaks on May 3, 2024, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. (Jeff Moreland/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThe survey revealed that the younger cohort focused their asset allocation on alternatives, and many expressed plans to allocate even more to these investments in the next few years.\n\nPelzar said this projected increase is \u201clargely reflective\u201d of the younger cohort\u2019s thoughts on the growth opportunities in the market. Because some of the alternative asset classes are less liquid, Pelzar said this implies that the younger generation is taking a longer-term view.\n\n\u201cYou see a much different profile between those two different cohorts, and I think that indicates lessons learned or things we need to be thinking about in terms of the investment landscape going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "body": "When Keith Gill\u2014aka Roaring Kitty\u2014burst onto the GameStop scene over three years ago to lead an army of Reddit users against hedge fund billionaires on Wall Street, the captivating underdog story left audiences wanting more.\n\nEight months after his story was immortalized on the silver screen, his sudden return now threatens to play out like a bad Hollywood sequel\u2014banking on nostalgia while lacking any of the original drama and heroism the second time around. Worse, there\u2019s no real villain to fill the shoes of Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin\u2014and now the main protagonist has gone missing.\n\nWithout a narrative compelling enough to go viral, the chances that Gill can marshal his scattered forces and send GameStop shares to the moon again appear to be between slim and none.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the new story is for this company that would in any way justify the $9 billion valuation,\u201d argues Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University\u2019s School of Business in Virginia. \u201cAnd Gill didn\u2019t seem to be able to articulate what that would be either.\u201d\n\nwaiting for Roaring Kitty to post a GameStop PnL screenshot. pic.twitter.com/GGitUlMbKt \u2014 wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) June 20, 2024\n\nSince euphoria upon Roaring Kitty's reappearance propelled the stock as high as $48 earlier this month, it has relinquished almost all of its gains. Now it\u2019s trading around the $25 mark, only slightly above the $23.14 close before Gill first revealed on June 2 that he owned 5 million shares.\n\nRoaring Kitty a creature of the lockdown-era zeitgeist\n\nAt the time GameStop first became a viral phenomenon, the 38-year-old portrayed it as nothing more than a YOLO trade\u2014a kind of \"get rich big or die trying\" mentality that analyst and podcaster Demetri Kofinas has taken to calling \u201cfinancial nihilism\u201d.\n\nGill even claimed his investment decisions can lack any rhyme or reason and simply result from drawing random cards out of an Uno deck he keeps handy while consulting his Magic Eight Ball.\n\nIn that sense, Roaring Kitty was truly a creature of the zeitgeist. At the time, asset prices across the board were artificially inflated by a mixture of zero interest rates and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Pandemic-era stimulus checks put found money in the pockets of everyday Americans at a time when gambling on sports was impossible after COVID eliminated spectator events.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQBubLv49fk\n\nMany discovered they could find all sorts of long shot bets offering a big payout with relatively little money in the options market, which enjoyed one crucial advantage over wagering on the ponies or a heavyweight title fight.\n\n\u201cIn sports betting, the more people pile in, the more the odds begin to even up without any effect on the likelihood of the outcome,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Fortune. But, \u201cif enough speculators buy a particular option at the same time, the greater the chances are that it pays off.\u201d\n\nTrapped at home and seeking community online, a number of small shareholders discovered wealthy hedge funds like Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 were all heavily short GameStop. Were Gill and his allies to gang together and buy short-dated call options from the likes of Citadel, it would send Ken Griffin\u2019s industry leading market maker and others like it scrambling to secure the underlying shares in order to cover their exposure. The Cohens and Griffins of the world would be tripping over each other bidding up the stock no matter the price.\n\nThe time was ripe for a GameStop run, too, since the retailer expected to profit from a lockdown-induced boom in video gaming matched with the launch of a new generation of Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox consoles.\n\nAlong with other social media users on the WallStreetBets subbredit, Gill helped catapult the stock to a split-adjusted intraday record of $120.75 in January 2021. The short squeeze that saw its market cap soar to $50 billion was so epic it caught the attention of the White House. A month later Congress held a hearing over it with Gill providing testimony.\n\nMeme stock craze gives way to return to normalcy\n\nFour years later, the story is completely different. The pandemic is over, people are gradually returning to the office and policy tightening by an inflation-fighting Fed means savers are no longer penalized for socking their cash away in money market accounts.\n\nThe games industry is in an outright crisis with Sony, the dominant console manufacturer, admitting sales of its PS5 have peaked. Games publishers are shutting down even successful studios and moving away from physical discs that cost money to manufacture and distribute in favor of remote downloads that leave GameStop one business model shy of a future.\n\nThe shared sense of community among fellow \u201capes\u201d, a self-deprecating term used by meme stock traders, is no longer as potent either. All that is left is a residual anger at a system rigged against them.\n\nWaiting for Roaring Kitty to post an update to his GameStop $GME holdings pic.twitter.com/qPjkuBekWr \u2014 wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) June 21, 2024\n\nWhether it\u2019s Nancy Pelosi\u2019s mysterious luck at stock picking that prompted calls to ban Congress members trading, the SEC granting Warren Buffett exemption from disclosing his near $7 billion investment in a rival, or hedge funds simply being invited by the media to talk their book all the time, it often feels like the elites can get away with everything.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to crystallize the kind of support needed for a pile-on against bystanders not directly involved in GameStop. Neither Pelosi or Buffett make for convincing enough substitutes for billionaires like Cohen and Griffin, who many believe pulled strings to get stock trading app Robinhood to pause activity when the market moved against them. (Citadel argues the allegations of collusion were thoroughly debunked and a U.S. district judge threw out a class action lawsuit citing lack of evidence).\n\n\u201cKen Griffin made for a really great villain. GameStop traders really wanted to stick it to Citadel,\u201d Horstmeyer says.\n\nThe vitriol was so intense Steve Cohen left Twitter due to threats he claimed were made against his family. This time around there\u2019s no prized scalp worthy of claiming, and latent anti-establishment sentiment is far more amorphous. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one concrete face to it,\u201d Horstmeyer adds.\n\nWhat's his strategy?\n\nIf Gill had any ideas how GameStop should reorganize, he hasn\u2019t expressed them since his return. He mainly communicates via guerilla-style memes (merely posting a cartoon dog on social media sent shares in pet supplies retailer Chewy soaring on Thursday).\n\nThe one time he actually spoke to his fans, he hosted a rambling hour-long livestream on YouTube where he merely aimed to \u201creiterate a lot my viewpoints I had previously\u201d rather than update his thesis in light of recent events.\n\nFor now, Gill is keeping everyone guessing about his ultimate intentions. At one point he teased viewers on his sole livestream by pulling out his old trusty Magic Eight Ball to ask what the plan is for GameStop\u2014only to shelve it before the round plastic oracle could reply.\n\n\u201cEither he really does believe in this company, or he\u2019s totally nihilistic and just wants to be internet famous,\u201d Horstmeyer continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a toss-up at this point.\u201d\n\nThere is one new possible twist in the story no one had seen coming: as the company\u2019s second largest individual shareholder, Gill could demand a seat on the board. He seemed to send a hidden message by raising his holding to the exact same number chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen had when he made a play.\n\nGill\u2019s last E*Trade post showed he\u2019s up $50 million, but that\u2019s small fry after briefly being within reach of becoming a billionaire hours before he turned 38 this month. Still\u2014unless he gambles everything away\u2014he looks to be set for life even with \u2018just\u2019 $270 million in his E*Trade account. Can Gill, who spent much of the 2010s between jobs, credibly embody the same underdog in GameStop\u2019s \u2018us versus them\u2019 narrative?\n\n\u201cMy question is who is now the \u2018them\u2019?\u201d asks Sosnick. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure who \u2018them\u2019 is, \u2018them\u2019 is probably you.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the protagonist himself seems to have gone missing in his own story. WallStreetBets, the social media account that elevated the concept of meme stocks, YOLO trades and loss porn, sounded like a jilted lover this past week. After preaching to its followers that GameStop\u2019s \u2018mother of all short squeezes\u2019 was coming any day now, WallStreetBets turned to obsessively posting about Gill.\n\n\u201cWaiting for Roaring Kitty to post a GameStop PnL screenshot, it posted last Thursday, using the sad Pablo Escobar meme from Narcos. 24 hours later it followed with another appeal: \u201cNeed Roaring Kitty to give us a sign right now.\u201d On Monday it pleaded for Gill to \u201cdrop a banger tweet\u201d before finally complaining that a fortnight had passed without word from the totemic leader.\n\nGameStop has more money than it knows what to do with\n\nRight now the only one truly sitting pretty is GameStop itself. Capitalizing on the sudden renewed interest in Roaring Kitty, it flooded the market with 120 million newly minted shares, diluting everyone including CEO Ryan Cohen, its largest shareholder. Thanks to the two issues, cash on hand quadrupled while its balance sheet doubled in size over the span of four short weeks.\n\nCitron is no longer short $GME. It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders. Despite Wedbush setting an $11 target today, we respect the\u2026 \u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) June 12, 2024\n\nThe company filled its coffers so full that Andrew Left of Citron Research raised the white flag and exited his short. He argued the company is still a basket case but it could survive alone on the back of its cash pile even if its core business implodes. \u201cWith $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,\u201d Left\u2019s firm said.\n\nGameStop could now achieve profitability by simply investing in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries rather than selling actual video games, making it the equivalent of a Ryan Cohen family office with a captive brick-and-mortar retail business.\n\nEven the company doesn\u2019t seem to have plans about what to do with all the money now in its bank account. The annual shareholder meeting lasted just a half hour and no questions were taken from investors.\n\nUnless something unexpected happens that can capture people's imagination and galvanize support, social media will not prove as effective at rallying enough troops to sustain a run in GameStop shares this time around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a sequel with no plot,\u201d says Sosnick.\n\nWith Gill seemingly on the sidelines for now, maybe he can loan out Cohen his trusty Magic Eight Ball.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Where Will Micron Technology Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "body": "Micron Technology's (NASDAQ: MU) 2024 stock market rally came to a screeching halt last week after the company released fiscal 2024 third-quarter results (for the three months ended May 30). The memory specialist's outlook didn't exceed Wall Street's expectations by a big enough margin, and the stock fell almost 8% just after its release.\n\nMicron's share prices were up nearly 67% in 2024 before its results came out, and the company headed into this latest report with high expectations thanks to the booming demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Those elevated expectations help explain why everyone was looking for a bigger beat than what Micron delivered.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Micron's quarterly report and see if the pullback is an overreaction.\n\nAnalyzing Micron Technology's quarterly numbers and guidance\n\nFiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $6.8 billion, a massive increase of 81% from the year-ago period and well ahead of the $6.67 billion consensus estimate. It is worth noting that the company's top line was well ahead of the midpoint of management's $6.6 billion guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, stronger memory prices led to a sharp jump in Micron's margins and helped it become profitable. The company reported an operating income margin of 14% for the quarter, up from a negative reading of 39% in the same period last year. As a result, it swung to an adjusted profit of $0.62 per share from a loss of $1.43 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe bottom-line performance was well ahead of the company's guidance of $0.45 per share and crushed the Wall Street estimate of $0.48. The good part is that Micron's guidance points toward more stunning growth in the current quarter.\n\nThe semiconductor company forecasts adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $7.6 billion. For comparison, it posted an adjusted loss of $1.07 per share on revenue of $4 billion in the same period last year. So its top line is set to increase an impressive 90% on a year-over-year basis, which would be an acceleration over the previous quarter's growth.\n\nWhat's more, the outlook is better than analysts' expectations of $1.02 per share in earnings on revenue of $7.59 billion. But it looks like investors expected stronger guidance and pressed the panic button when its outlook turned out to be just ahead of expectations. This seems like an overreaction since the company is set to grow at an even better pace this year.\n\nMicron coasted past its guidance last quarter, and there is a good chance it might do so once again thanks to AI, a catalyst that could help the stock soar impressively over the next year. Let's look at why.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI could help this chipmaker sustain its phenomenal growth\n\nMicron's data center revenue shot up an impressive 50% on a quarter-over-quarter basis with the solid demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Management points out that the company \"grew share in high-margin AI-related product categories such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory), high-capacity DIMMs and data center SSDs.\"\n\nIt generated $100 million in revenue from selling HBM chips last quarter. More importantly, management says it expects to finish fiscal 2024 with \"several hundred million dollars\" in HBM revenue. In fiscal 2025, which will begin in September this year, it is forecasting \"multiple billions of dollars in revenue from HBM.\"\n\nThis huge market for HBM can be attributed to the growing demand for AI chips made by the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. These chipmakers are packing larger HBM chips into their AI graphics cards to increase memory bandwidth and computational power so that they can train large language models.\n\nMicron says that its HBM capacity is sold out for 2024 and 2025. Investors should also note that HBM demand is forecast to grow rapidly in the long run.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts that the HBM market could double each year between 2023 and 2026 and generate annual revenue of $30 billion after a couple of years. So Micron's impressive AI-fueled growth is here to stay, which explains why its top and bottom lines are estimated to increase rapidly over the next year.\n\nThe company generated $17.3 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Its fourth-quarter guidance indicates that it is on track to finish the year with nearly $25 billion in revenue, which would be a 61% increase over the previous year. That's higher than analysts' expectations.\n\nMU Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAlso, as the chart above tells us, analysts are expecting Micron's revenue to increase nearly 50% in fiscal 2025. But it won't be surprising to see the company clocking faster growth as its HBM revenue growth accelerates on the back of healthy AI chip demand. Even better, the company's bottom line is expected to grow by nearly a multiple of 9 in the next year as compared to fiscal 2024.\n\nMU EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis growth can be attributed to the strong memory-pricing environment as demand is outpacing supply. For instance, HBM prices are expected to rise by 5% to 10% next year. When combined with the massive jump in sales volumes, it is easy to see why bottom-line growth is set to take off in the next year.\n\nGiven that Micron stock trades at just 19 times forward earnings -- a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 29 (using the index as a proxy for tech shares) -- buying this AI stock following its latest pullback looks like a no-brainer as the rapid jump in its earnings could help it sustain its impressive rally over the next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Hydrogen Stock: Plug Power vs. Nikola",
        "body": "Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) represent two different ways to invest in the nascent hydrogen power market. Plug Power sells hydrogen fuel systems for electric forklifts and other warehouse equipment, while Nikola develops semitrailer trucks that run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nBoth stocks initially attracted a stampede of bulls. Plug Power went public at a reverse split-adjusted IPO price of $150 in October 1999, and its stock skyrocketed to a record high of $1,498 during the peak of the dot-com bubble.\n\nNikola went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, and its stock opened at a reverse split-adjusted price of $1,126.50 on the first day before hitting its all-time high of $2,391.90 over the following week.\n\nImage source: Nikola.\n\nBut today, Plug Power and Nikola only trade at about $2 and $10, respectively. Let's see why these hydrogen stocks ran out of fuel -- and which one could be the better turnaround play.\n\nPlug Power still has a lot to prove\n\nPlug Power has severe customer concentration issues. It generates most of its revenue by selling its fuel systems to Amazon and Walmart. But to lock in those two big customers, it granted them stock warrants (options to buy more shares of the company at a discount) to subsidize the fuel cells they bought.\n\nThat loss-leading strategy caused it to report a negative net revenue of $93 million in 2020 as the costs of funding those incentives offset its customer payments. Plug's revenue turned positive again in 2021 and subsequently rose 40% in 2022 and 27% in 2023, but its operating margins consistently withered as its net losses widened.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $502 million $701 million $891 million Operating margin (87%) (97%) (151%) Net income (loss) ($460 million) ($724 million) ($1.37 billion)\n\nData source: Plug Power.\n\nTo make matters worse, it delayed the filing of its annual report for 2020 and had to restate all of its financials for 2018 and 2019. Those blunders, along with the market's waning interest in renewable energy stocks, drove away the bulls.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Plug Power's revenue to only rise 4% to $926 million, its operating margin to improve to negative 89%, and its net loss to narrow to $826 million. It mainly attributes that slowdown to the macro headwinds, which are driving its top customers to dial back their big hydrogen fuel cell upgrades.\n\nThe company ended the first quarter of 2024 with only $173 million in cash and equivalents, but it recently secured a new $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build up to six green hydrogen production facilities. That lifeline should buy it a bit more time to scale up its business, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nNikola overpromised and underdelivered\n\nNikola only delivered 79 battery-powered semitrailer trucks (BEVs) and 35 hydrogen fuel cell-powered semitrailer trucks (FCEVs) in 2023. That was well below the original target of 3,500 BEVs and 2,000 FCEVs which it set during its pre-merger presentation. It also recalled nearly all of its BEVs last year after a series of widely publicized battery fires. Nikola originally aimed to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2023 but fell far short of that.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $0 $51 million $36 million Operating margin N/A (1,378%) (1,806%) Net income (loss) ($690 million) ($784 million) ($966 million)\n\nData source: Nikola.\n\nNikola's founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was also convicted of securities and wire fraud in 2022.\n\nThe current CEO, Steve Girsky, claims the company can scale up its business and generate \"$150 million to $170 million\" in total truck revenue in 2024. Analysts expect it to generate $126 million in revenue, with a net loss of $496 million for the full year.\n\nThat's a grim outlook for a company that only had $346 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2024. It's also constantly diluting its existing investors with new share offerings to raise more cash. Over the past three years, Nikola increased its share count by a whopping 242% as Plug Power's share count rose 30%.\n\nNikola believes it can overcome its growing pains, ramp up its production, and build more hydrogen charging stations with its partner Voltera to support its FCEVs. But just like Plug Power, there's no clear indication that its business model can survive over the long term. Its BEVs could also face fierce competition from Tesla's new Semi model.\n\nThe better buy: Plug Power\n\nPlug Power and Nikola both look historically cheap at 2 and 4 times this year's sales, respectively. I personally wouldn't touch either of these stocks until more green shoots appear, but Plug Power's higher revenue, DOE lifeline, and lower valuations make it a more compelling turnaround play than Nikola right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Plug Power wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "The first half of the year brought the market many stock split announcements across industries, from technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to consumer stock Walmart. These companies launched splits to lower their share prices after the shares soared to high levels \u2014 the idea is to make it easier for more people to invest without relying on fractional shares.\n\nThese players helped drive the S&P 500 higher in the first half of the year as investors welcomed the stock split news. Stock splits aren't share performance catalysts though, as they're just mechanical movements. So, investors who seize the opportunity to buy generally are making the move for a fundamental reason \u2014 such as confidence in the company's future growth prospects.\n\nNow, as we head into the second half of the year, you may be wondering which stock split players may continue their paths higher and represent the best long-term bets. Let's check out one to buy hand over fist, and one to avoid like the plague.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStock to buy: Nvidia\n\nNvidia already climbed more than 150% in the first half of the year thanks to its booming artificial intelligence (AI) business. The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks \u2014 and Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest on the market. So, it's no surprise the company holds 80% share of the AI chip market.\n\nThe tech giant also sells a wide range of related AI products and services, including enterprise software \u2014 available through all of the public cloud service providers. This makes access to Nvidia very easy for potential customers.\n\nThis has helped the company generate record revenue quarter after quarter, grow revenue and net income in the triple digits, and widen gross margin. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached $26 billion and gross margin came in at more than 78% \u2014 from about 64% a year ago.\n\nWhat makes me so optimistic about Nvidia in the second half and beyond? The company pledges to update its top performing chips on an annual basis, a strategy that should keep it ahead of rivals. As part of this, later this year Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture and chip \u2014 a system laced with many innovations that could make it a game-changer.\n\nAll of this means Nvidia merits its valuation of 46 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock's gains this year and into the future may be far from over.\n\nStock to avoid: Chipotle\n\nFirst, I'll start by saying Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) isn't necessarily a sell or an avoid for every investor. This fast casual chain has progressively increased earnings over time, and its expansion strategy should keep that going. Chipotle's brand strength also may help it lift revenue over the long run too. So, if you're looking to diversify your portfolio and want to buy a solid restaurant stock, you may consider adding a few shares or if you're a Chipotle shareholder today, you might want to hold on to your position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut for the value investor, Chipotle is a stock to avoid, and here's why. The stock trades for 59 times forward earnings estimates, extremely high for the industry and high considering the source of Chipotle's growth. It's important to note that comparable restaurant sales growth has been in the mid-single digits \u2014 increasing 7% in the first quarter of this year and 7.9% for the full year 2023. So Chipotle's growth mainly has come from adding on new restaurants \u2014 it opened 271 last year.\n\nChipotle, now at about 3,500 locations, aims to double that to 7,000 in North America, and the company is expanding internationally too. It's fine to grow through expansion, but without stronger comparable sales increases, Chipotle doesn't look like a high-growth stock today, yet it's trading at growth stock prices.\n\nOf course, over time, Chipotle shares still may have room to run as the company's new locations start adding to revenue. But, considering the hefty price tag for this stock, as we transition into the second half of the year, value investors should avoid this expensive player like the plague.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Share prices of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) plunged following the June 27 release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, with the stock having one of its worst days on record. The stock price has now fallen more than 53% since the start of 2024.\n\nLet's look at Walgreens' most recent quarterly report, why the stock plummeted, and whether now is the time to buy.\n\nReduced guidance, store closures, and new plan\n\nFor its fiscal Q3 (ended in May), Walgreens saw its revenue rise 2.6% year over year to $36.4 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 36.5% to $0.63. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 2.3% year over year, with same-store sales up 3.5%. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 5.7%, while comparable retail sales were down 2.3%. Adjusted operating income plunged 47.9% year over year to $501 million, hurt by weak retail sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures.\n\nInternational sales rose 2.8% year over year. Boots UK sales grew 1.6%, with retail same-store sales up 6% and pharmacy same-store sales up 5.8%. Adjusted operating income slid 15.8% year over year to $175 million.\n\nRevenue from its U.S. healthcare segment rose 7.6% year over year to $2.1 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $23 million, an improvement from negative $113 million a year ago. VillageMD revenue grew 7% year over year, while Shields revenue jumped 24%.\n\nGross margins fell to 17.8% from 18.6% a year ago. Gross margins in its U.S. retail pharmacy business fell to 17.7% from 19.1%. This shows how the company continues to get squeezed from pharmacy benefit managers over drug prices.\n\nWalgreens generated negative $314 million in operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year and negative $1.4 billion in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in debt and $703 million in cash.\n\nLooking ahead, the company reduced its fiscal full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.80 to $2.95 from a prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35. Management expects the challenging consumer environment and muted script volume growth it is seeing to continue into 2025.\n\nAs a result, the company plans to close a \"significant portion\" of its 8,700 U.S. locations over the next three years, with it set to examine about 25% of its unprofitable locations. The company also said it will make investments to improve customer and patient experience, such as accelerating its digital and omnichannel offerings, building its loyalty program, and reducing the number of brands and SKUs on its shelves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also plans to reduce its stake in VillageMD and no longer be its majority owner. However, it plans to keep its positions in Shields and Boots UK.\n\nThe company also remains in talks with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health issuers about creating a better reimbursement system that will help stabilize its pharmacy margins and ensure fair payment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs this dip an opportunity to buy the stock?\n\nReimbursement rate pressures that continue to hurt Walgreens' margins and lower profitably remain its biggest problem. Shifting to a cost-plus model, where it would get additional payments when it can help slow the inflationary costs on drug prices, would greatly benefit the company. It would also help relieve the constant drug reimbursement pressure it has seen year in and year out.\n\nHowever, while Walgreens is actively working with PBMs and other payers to change the model, this won't happen overnight. And the PBMs have clearly shown that they hold the upper hand.\n\nIn the meantime, it is a good idea to sell off some of its VillageMD stake, as this was a failed investment idea that stemmed from the company's previous management team. Closing unprofitable stores is also the right move. Walgreen's balance sheet is loaded with debt, so paying off debt and returning to positive free cash flow is a priority.\n\nTrading at about a 4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Walgreens finds itself in the bargain bin. However, its debt load, lack of operating cash flow generation, and weakening operating performance are reasons the stock is trading at the current levels.\n\nWBA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFor patient investors, Walgreens is worth taking a chance on at current levels. The stock is cheap, and the company's new CEO is now looking to make his imprint on the pharmacy giant. Given its valuation, if he can stabilize its pharmacy margins and improve its cash flow profile, the company has a lot of turnaround potential. However, a turnaround is going to take a while, and as such, it may take time for investors to be rewarded for their patience.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Broadcom Stock Hand Over Fist Before Its 10-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "body": "Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) share price nearly doubled last year. The stock is up over 45% so far in 2024. That's great news for shareholders. However, for some investors, this tremendous success pushed Broadcom's share price so high (over $1,600) that they were reluctant to buy.\n\nThat won't be a problem for too much longer. In its first-quarter update a few weeks ago, Broadcom announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on July 12, 2024. The semiconductor and software maker's shares will trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning July 15, 2024.\n\nBroadcom CFO Kirsten Spears said the purpose of this stock split for \"to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees.\" Some believe this greater accessibility could provide a nice catalyst for the already high-flying stock. Should you buy Broadcom stock hand over fist before its 10-for-1 stock split?\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nHistorically, stocks have jumped 25% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to the Bank of America Research Investment Committee. Broadcom's shares have risen only around 8% since the announcement of its stock split, so it could still have plenty of room to run if history is a guide.\n\nAre there reasons to buy Broadcom stock other than a potential stock split surge? Absolutely. I'd put the company's acquisition of VMware near the top of the list. This deal contributed significantly to Broadcom's revenue soaring 43% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company expects VMWare's revenue growth will accelerate through the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, the biggest reason to buy Broadcom stock is its artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Seven of the eight largest AI clusters in the world use Broadcom's Ethernet technology. Broadcom expects its networking revenue to jump 40% this year primarily due to AI-related demand.\n\nThe company's AI accelerator business is highly profitable. Creating networks to connect AI accelerators is complicated. But Broadcom is arguably the best at doing it. As Tan said in the Q2 earnings call, the company has \"the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric.\"\n\nBroadcom is also a free cash flow (FCF) machine. In Q2, the company generated FCF of $4.4 billion -- 36% of total revenue. If we exclude the cash Broadcom used for restructuring and integration, its FCF rose 18% year over year to $5.3 billion and made up 42% of revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case against Broadcom\n\nDespite the excitement about Broadcom's stock split, it won't change anything about the company's underlying business. Also, investors who wanted to buy the stock but were leery of its high share price could have done so with fractional shares.\n\nBroadcom's growth story wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the VMWare deal. Excluding VMWare, Q2 revenue increased by only 12% year over year. The company won't be able to rely on the acquisition to boost its year-over-year numbers after Q4, since the transaction closed on Nov. 22, 2023.\n\nSome parts of Broadcom's business remain weak. Wireless revenue in Q2 rose only 2% year over year. Server storage connectivity revenue fell 27%. Broadband revenue plunged 39%.\n\nJust five customers generate roughly 40% of total sales. Apple alone makes up 17% of Broadcom's total revenue. This reliance on a small number of customers presents a key risk for Broadcom.\n\nThe company's AI opportunity is big. However, Nvidia could emerge as a strong competitor to Broadcom in Ethernet switching and custom AI accelerators.\n\nThere's also a potential valuation concern. Broadcom stock trades at nearly 34 times forward earnings and 16.7 times trailing 12-month sales.\n\nBuy before the split?\n\nI don't think investors should be in a rush to buy Broadcom stock before its stock split. My hunch is that the split will be largely a non-event rather than a major catalyst.\n\nThat said, Broadcom could remain a winner over the long term. Patient investors could buy now, wait until the stock split, or hold off for a pullback to buy on the dip. If you plan on owning Broadcom for 10 years or more, the exact timing of when you buy probably won't matter all that much.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "The time has finally come. On June 16, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) underwent a closely watched and historic 50-for-1 stock split. The previous four-figure price tag of the stock is currently at about $65.\n\nManagement felt this was the right proposal, given how well the restaurant company's shares have been performing. They're up 44% in 2024, and in the past five years, have soared 348%.\n\nIs this magnificent restaurant stock a no-brainer investment opportunity right after its 50-for-1 stock split?\n\nNo fundamental changes\n\nStock splits typically happen after a company's nominal share price gets too high. Of course, this is a good problem to have for Chipotle because it means the stock has done well for investors over the years. But by artificially cutting the price, the stock can be accessible to more investors.\n\nChipotle's outstanding share count expanded 50-fold to 1.4 billion. And the share price is now 1/50th what it was before this event. It's helpful to think of this situation as a pizza being cut into smaller slices.\n\nIt's really important to remember that from a fundamental perspective, nothing has changed with Chipotle. This is still the same business it was yesterday. Through its fast-casual stores, this company still sells Tex-Mex food like bowls and burritos.\n\nSince the executive team first announced the stock split in March, shares have climbed 17%. Perhaps the anticipation of this happening is precisely what has driven even greater bullish sentiment from the market.\n\nCurb your appetite\n\nAs we view the company and stock today to assess if Chipotle is a no-brainer investment opportunity, it's critical to consider the quality of the company. This is a stellar business.\n\nThe company continues to post strong financial results, despite ongoing macro headwinds. After revenue jumped 14.3% in 2023, it rose 14.1% in Q1 2024 (ended March 31). This was boosted by same-store sales growth of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new restaurants.\n\nChipotle is extremely profitable, which is supported by its proven pricing power. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 11.5%. And from a store-level perspective, 27.5% of revenue turned into operating profit in the first quarter, an outstanding figure.\n\nThere's still a lot of growth to be achieved. Management sees the potential to have 7,000 stores open in North America one day, roughly double the current footprint. This goal is higher than the previous target of 6,000, so it shows you that the leadership team is extremely optimistic about Chipotle's long-term prospects to further penetrate its key market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of these positive factors might make you believe that this stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity. However, consider just how high the expectations have gotten. It seems wild to me to pay a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 70.1 for the shares of this business. There's no margin of safety for investors should the company post quarterly financial results that the market isn't pleased with for whatever reason.\n\nOf course, unsustainable trends can last a lot longer than people might think. And this could be the case with Chipotle stock, as it has traded at a steep valuation for a while.\n\nNot only do I think the stock should be avoided, but I\u2019m also not comfortable calling this a no-brainer investment opportunity right now. Maybe if the P/E multiple dropped below 30, I'd adopt this view. This might not happen for a long time, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "body": "Dividend stocks offer a great way to add cash to your portfolio and help you compound your overall returns with time. Whether you use that dividend money to add to your portfolio or cash it out, these types of stocks can help you diversify the types of businesses you own shares in.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in dividend stocks, you need to make sure the companies you buy have a strong underlying business and balance sheet that will support and help grow the dividends being paid out. A top dividend stock will also have a history of maintaining and raising its dividend in a wide range of market environments.\n\nOn that note, here are two top dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio. Each performs well, whether the bull market continues or bearish investor sentiment returns. If the bear market does return, these stocks have proven over the decades to be safe ones to hold.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has paid out and raised its dividend every single year for 62 years and counting. That places the pharmaceutical giant in a very select group of companies that have earned the moniker Dividend King.\n\nJ&J boasts a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, which is more than twice the average yield among S&P 500 stocks. Looking back over the last decade, Johnson & Johnson's dividend has increased an average of 6% annually. Its payout ratio is a very manageable 30%.\n\nJ&J's dividend helps to make up for the stock's relatively weak stock performance over the last several years. The weak stock performance also somewhat helps explain the higher-than-average yield. The stock is down based on several factors, but one of the biggest is ongoing litigation and potential multi-billion liabilities related to its talc products. The company has roughly $26 billion in cash on its balance sheet to help manage these ongoing lawsuits and eventually pay settlements while also maintaining its commitment to shareholders.\n\nInvesting in Johnson & Johnson also means putting cash into a company that has been in business for 138 years, and is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world by revenue. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has brought in over $17 billion in profits on about $86 billion in revenue. It's also generated approximately $24 billion in levered free cash flow looking back over the last 12 months.\n\nLast year, J&J spun off its slower-growing consumer healthcare product segment into a company called Kenvue. The remaining two divisions -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices -- are faster growing and should help J&J boost its growth efforts in the coming years. The company has returned approximately 60% of free cash flow to investors over the last five years, while 65% of sales come from products in which it controls the top or second global market share position.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the short term, this is likely not a business for growth-oriented investors. However, long-term investors seeking a company that generates steady financial gains from a broad portfolio of valuable pharmaceuticals and medical devices may find Johnson & Johnson poses a compelling investment opportunity. With its stock price underperforming, Johnson & Johnson's storied dividend history makes the business an attractive selection for income-seeking investors. When its underlying issues, including expensive litigation finally get resolved, share prices are likely to rise.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) boasts a dividend yield of around 3% and has faithfully raised its dividend every year for 62 years as well. The beverage giant doesn't generate massive stock price gains these days, but its dividend and share price increases have helped deliver a total return of 46% over the last five years and over 108% in the trailing 10-year period.\n\nFounded in 1886, the company now manages one of the largest beverage operations in the world. Coca-Cola controls roughly 46% of the soft drink market in the U.S., one of its largest markets.\n\nOver the trailing 12 months, Coca-Cola has delivered profits of about $11 billion on revenue of $46 billion. It's maintained a profit margin of around 23%, an exceptional figure in an industry where margins are historically razor-thin. The company has a payout ratio of about 74%, which is relatively high but still quite manageable. Its dividend has grown an average of 5% annually over the past decade.\n\nJust in the past 12 months, the company has brought in operating cash flow of about $12 billion, with levered free cash flow of approximately $11 billion. Currency headwinds and a fluctuating macro environment have impacted the company's growth in the last few years, but its commitment to its dividend and the strength of its balance sheet remain a testament to the resilience of this business.\n\nLong-term buy-and-hold investors looking for steady portfolio growth and dividends can find a lot to love about Coca-Cola.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Johnson & Johnson wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Just Turned Bullish on These 3 Hot Stocks. Should You Buy Them?",
        "body": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) company Carrier Global (NYSE: CARR), building materials company Owens Corning (NYSE: OC), and copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) have all received Wall Street analyst upgrades recently, and justifiably so. These three stocks present a promising opportunity for investors to capitalize on positive trends, potentially leading to significant profit. Here's why.\n\n1. Carrier Global positions itself for growth\n\nAnalysts from financial firms Citi and Barclays recently raised their price targets on Carrier Global's stock, with Citi now at $74 and Barclays at $81. These reputable firms are optimistic about the stock, with City upgrading to buy from neutral and Barclays maintaining an overweight rating, further solidifying the credibility of these upgrades.\n\nBoth analysts like the company's decision to focus on its core HVAC competency by selling off non-core fire, security, and commercial refrigeration businesses while acquiring European heat pump and HVAC company Viessmann Climate Solutions for $13.2 billion.\n\nThe deal emphasizes Carrier's intent to exploit a regulatory environment favoring sustainable climate technologies. Buildings and HVAC systems are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, so increasing their efficiency is a vital part of the pathway to net zero emissions.\n\nAt the same time, the growth of adoption of smart building technology, offered by Carrier and others, is producing tangible benefits to building owners, and there's a huge long-term demand coming from the need to retrofit buildings to meet net-zero emissions targets.\n\nMoreover, with Wall Street expecting a free cash flow of $3.1 billion in 2025 (when Viessmann will be integrated), the stock currently trades at less than 19 times estimated FCF in 2025. This is an attractive valuation for a company set for long-term growth driven by the regulation and adoption of net zero emissions targets.\n\n2. Owens Corning: a housing stock to buy\n\nA lot of companies talk the talk when it comes to believing in the long-term growth potential of their end markets. However, roofing products, insulation, and composites company Owens Corning also walks the walk. When faced with challenging residential housing markets due to a relatively high-interest-rate environment, management decided to double down on its exposure to the U.S. housing market by acquiring residential door company Masonite for $3.9 billion.\n\nIt's a move that finds favor with a Loop Capital analyst who likes the deal. Owens Corning and Masonite sell to many of the same types of customers in the building industry (contractors, builders, distributors, home centers, homeowners, etc). It makes sense to offer them a range of solutions in one shop. Moreover, management believes it can generate $125 million in synergies from sharing sales, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), as well as sourcing and supply chain synergies.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, from an investor perspective, the real attraction of the deal is the company increasing its exposure to the housing market in a year when it could be about to receive the benefit of a cut in interest rates.\n\nIf you believe the Federal Reserve will tame inflation and cut rates and that the housing market will recover as it traditionally does when the rate cycle turns, then the Masonite acquisition is perfect timing. Trading on less than 12 times estimated 2024 earnings, Owens Corning is an excellent value.\n\n3. Freeport-McMoran and the New Economy\n\nIn common with Carrier, copper miner Freeport-McMoRan benefits from the economy's trend toward decarbonization. Copper is essential for electric vehicles, energy storage, solar power, and the transmission and distribution networks necessary to connect renewable energy to the grid.\n\nAt the same time, the trends toward electrification of the economy continue apace. Data centers, industrial automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), smart buildings/infrastructure, etc. All of these exciting growth areas require electrification, and that means more copper demand.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley favor this argument. One of its analysts recently increased its price target for the stock to $62 from $49.50 and upgraded its rating to \"overweight\" from equal weight. In addition, the analyst believes challenging supply conditions (geopolitical tensions, mining permit restrictions, etc.) will continue to create upward pressure on the price of copper.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan is well placed to benefit, given its combination of existing assets, notably in Indonesia and the U.S., its pipeline of potential expansion projects to invest in, and a leaching initiative that can lead to a significant increase in copper recovered from Freeport-McMoRan's existing stockpiles.\n\nIf you believe in the megatrends identified above and the potential for copper price appreciation, then Freeport-McMoRan is a great stock to invest in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Freeport-McMoRan right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Freeport-McMoRan, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Freeport-McMoRan wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "With a Senator Questioning Plug Power's Government Loan, Is This an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?",
        "body": "Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) surged in May after the company announced that it had received a conditional commitment for a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, the stock is now well below where it was before the announcement, and one U.S. senator has called the loan into question.\n\nThe stock, meanwhile, is now down over 70% in the past year.\n\nLet's look at the proposed DOE loan, why it is being called into question, why it is so important for Plug Power, and whether the slide in the stock is a buying opportunity.\n\nFixing a flawed business model\n\nPlug Power has long been grappling with a flawed business model, which it has set out to fix. The company initially found a niche selling fuel cells used in forklifts and other material-handling equipment to companies with high-volume, three-shift warehouses like Amazon and Walmart.\n\nBut the flaw in its business model was that it would sell the hydrogen fuel needed to run its fuel cells at a loss. This could be seen in the company's most recent results, where negative gross margin led to a $159 million gross loss.\n\nJust to emphasize how bad this is, the loss was measured before any corporate costs. The company loses a lot of money on the hydrogen fuel it sells, although in the first quarter, it also lost money on the equipment it sold.\n\nObviously, acquiring or making something for $3 and then selling it for $1 is not a durable business model, but that is pretty close to what Plug Power did last quarter with hydrogen fuel. Over the years, the company has mostly obtained hydrogen from third parties and sold it to its customers at a huge loss.\n\nThis is why it has embarked on building a network of its own hydrogen plants that can produce fuel that it can sell to its customers for a profit.\n\nThis is where the DOE loan comes in. In May, the company was given the chance to secure the loan -- if certain conditions to be negotiated by the company and the government are met -- to help it build out its hydrogen plant network. If it is approved, the loan would help fund up to six green hydrogen production facilities.\n\nPlug Power already has two plants up and running, and another is expected to be complete by the end of the year, and that would meet about 65% of where it sees demand headed.\n\nThe loan would help create a large plant in Texas scheduled for next year that would meet its customer needs and allow it to expand beyond that.\n\nHowever, in June, Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, asked the DOE's inspector general to investigate \"any potential impropriety\" by the the DOE\u2019s Loan Programs Office and the loan program's director, Jigar Shah, due to possible conflicts of interest. The senator also questioned Plug Power's viability given its $1.4 billion in losses last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Plug Power could pursue financing elsewhere if the loan ultimately does not get approved, the terms and interest rates would undoubtedly be much less favorable. And given the company's financial position and negative operating cash flow, there is no guarantee it would be able to find an institution to lend it the money.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs the sell-off a buying opportunity?\n\nPlug Power shares shot up as much as 70%, to $4.90, in the day after the DOE loan offer was announced. Today it is trading more than 15% below where it was before the announcement.\n\nIf the loan is approved, there should be some immediate upside potential given the past reaction and where the stock now trades. However, that could be short-lived.\n\nPlug Power, meanwhile, has said it is looking to get to gross margin breakeven in its fuel business in the fourth quarter, which would not be dependent on the loan. That is a potential catalyst, but a break-even gross margin is still not a complete solution because it will not make the company profitable or start generating cash.\n\nAt this point, I would view Plug Power more like a lottery ticket. If it gets the loan, builds out its plants, and turns positive in gross margin and free cash flow, there could be tremendous upside in the stock. But just like most lottery tickets, there is also the chance it becomes worthless.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Plug Power wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Vanguard's Top ETF Is Up 24% This Year. Here's Another ETF Up Twice As Much.",
        "body": "There's a good reason why Warren Buffett likes Vanguard funds. Vanguard, led by (the late) Jack Bogle, pioneered and popularized investing in index funds. Vanguard's funds are known for their low costs.\n\nThose low expense ratios wouldn't mean much, though, if Vanguard's funds didn't perform well. The good news is that many of them do. Vanguard's top exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 24% this year. But there's another ETF up twice as much.\n\nBeating Vanguard's best\n\nVanguard offers 86 ETFs. One has outperformed all others in 2024: The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG). This ETF has jumped 24% this year following an impressive 28% gain in 2023.\n\nMost investors would probably be happy with these returns. However, those who want even bigger gains might want to check out the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This ETF has soared a whopping 48% year to date.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is managed by global investment manager VanEck. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. As its name reflects, this index includes companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThis year's big returns aren't a fluke for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. It has delivered an average annual return of 38.6% over the last five years. Since the fund's inception in December 2011, its average annual return is 26.5%. By comparison, the Vanguard S&P Growth Index Fund ETF is up 16.6% over the last five years and 15.7% since its inception in September 2010.\n\nWhy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is soaring\n\nYou can probably make a good guess as to why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is performing so well this year. Chip stocks are sizzling hot thanks primarily to surging demand for servers for training and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\nThis VanEck ETF owns only 26 stocks. The top five holdings make up over 50% of its total portfolio. When these stocks move higher, so does the ETF's price. And they've moved a lot higher so far in 2024.\n\nThe fund's largest holding is Nvidia, which comprises 20.4% of its total assets. Nvidia's share price has exploded 150% higher this year. Customers can't get enough of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in supporting AI models.\n\nAnother 12.9% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is invested in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company makes chips designed by leading customers including Nvidia. Its stock is up 65% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoughly 7.7% of the fund's portfolio is in Broadcom. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Its shares have jumped more than 40% in 2024.\n\nThe VanEck ETF's fourth- and fifth-largest positions are Advanced Micro Devices and ASML Holding with 4.97% and 4.8%, respectively, of the fund's net assets. Advanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's top rivals. Its stock is up only around 8% this year. Meanwhile, shares of semiconductor fabrication equipment maker ASML have risen over 35%.\n\nShould you buy this high-flying ETF?\n\nRisk-averse investors should probably stay away from the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. When it falls, it falls hard. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, the ETF plunged 24%. The fund also trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings ratio of over 39 for the stocks in its portfolio.\n\nHowever, aggressive investors who want to own a basket of semiconductor stocks should consider buying the ETF. AI should continue to provide a strong tailwind for these stocks. The VanEck ETF's annual expense ratio is 0.35%, higher than Vanguard's top ETF this year but still not too expensive.

        "title": "Spirit Aero to be broken up as Boeing agrees $4.7 billion stock deal",
        "body": "By Tim Hepher, Shivani Tanna and Mike Stone\n\n(Reuters) -Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in stock and Airbus moved to take on the supplier's loss-making Europe-focused activities in return for hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation following months of talks.\n\nThe near-two-decade independence of the world's largest standalone aerostructures company ended in a carve-up between its largest customers after the latest Boeing 737 MAX crisis, sparked by a mid-air door plug blowout in January, brought to a head doubts over the resilience of fuselage manufacturing.\n\nBoeing, which spun off Spirit in 2005, said it would repurchase its former subsidiary for about $37.25 per share, as reported by Reuters on Sunday, giving it an enterprise value of $8.3 billion including debt.\n\n\"Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,\" Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan said in a statement.\n\nSpirit shares rose some 8% in premarket trading, while Boeing dipped by just under 1%.\n\nThe Wichita, Kansas-based company said the deal offered a 30% premium versus the day before Boeing and Spirit announced talks to bring the struggling supplier back in house on March 1.\n\nBoeing has long pondered buying back its former subsidiary, which analysts say has struggled to thrive independently despite diversifying into work for Europe's Airbus and others.\n\nThe decision to go ahead comes as Boeing tries to resolve a sprawling corporate and industrial crisis that has engulfed one of the industry's key suppliers.\n\nBoeing is trying to move past months of difficulties sparked by the Jan. 5 blowout of a door plug on a virtually new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 jet that exposed quality problems.\n\nThose issues have led to a substantial slowdown in output at Boeing, rippling across the global commercial aviation industry.\n\nThe U.S. planemaker has also announced the planned departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in the wake of the crisis, with industry executives and analysts pointing to Spirit's Shanahan, a former senior Boeing executive, as one of the possible replacements.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how long he might be tied to Spirit, with the Boeing deal not due to close until mid-2025.\n\nIn a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said the deal \"should add clarity ... potentially for the Boeing board\u2019s attention to move to the decision on the next CEO\".\n\nAIRBUS DEAL\n\nSpirit, the manufacturer of the door plug, had been spun off from Boeing in one of a series of moves that critics say were emblematic of a focus on cost-cutting over quality.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing made the decision to buy back Spirit in the aftermath of the door plug blowout, in what it described as an effort to address its safety problems and shore up its production line.\n\nThat raised questions over the future of work that Spirit caries out for Boeing's arch-rival Airbus, prompting the CEO of the European giant to warn in April that it stood ready if necessary to veto changes in control of Airbus-related plants.\n\nOn Monday, Airbus said it would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco as reported by Reuters last week.\n\nIt will also take over minor work currently carried out in Wichita. The separate Airbus deal was triggered by talks between Boeing and Spirit and was loosely coordinated between the three companies, sources said. It is subject to due diligence.\n\nAirbus shares were up by about 2% in Monday morning trade.\n\nBecause Spirit's Airbus-related activities lose money, industry sources had said the European planemaker was pressing for up to $1 billion in compensation in return for taking over the plants, which make strategic parts for its A350 and A220 airliners.\n\nAirbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, depending on the final outlines of the deal, while it would pay the supplier a symbolic $1 for the assets.\n\nThat echoes its decision to buy the Canadian-designed CSeries small jetliner program for just $1 from Bombardier in 2018. It later renamed the jet the A220.\n\nUntil the latest shake-up, Airbus had not envisaged taking control of the loss-making A220 wings manufacturing carried out in Belfast, which Spirit bought from Bombardier in 2019.\n\nMonday's deal lifts doubts over the future of part of Northern Ireland's top industrial employer, though sources have said Airbus may need to invest significant sums to increase output and make the wings more affordable to produce.\n\nSpirit said it planned to sell operations in Prestwick, Scotland and in Subang, Malaysia that support Airbus programs and those in Belfast that do not support Airbus programs.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone and David Shepardson in Washington, Allison Lampert in Montreal, Tim Hepher in Paris and Shivansh Tiwary, Abhijith Ganapavaram and Shivani Tanna in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gaffen, Shubham Kalia, Jamie Freed and Jason Neely)",

        "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted Nvidia to new heights. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has soared 27,310% in the past 10 years, making it one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nBut there's a much smaller business that has performed even better. I'm talking about Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH). This beverage stock has skyrocketed 27,360% in the past decade (as of June 25), turning a $10,000 investment into a jaw-dropping $2.7 million.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Celsius' meteoric rise to becoming a $13-billion business today. Then by viewing things with a fresh perspective, investors can assess if the stock is a smart buying opportunity.\n\nEnergizing growth\n\nIf you see a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Celsius has, it's worth taking the time to figure out what factors led to such a strong performance. In this case, it shouldn't be a surprise that the key driver of Celsius' ascent has been incredible sales growth.\n\nBehind only Red Bull and Monster Beverage, the business has become the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. In 2023, Celsius reported revenue of $1.3 billion. That figure was 102% higher than the year before. And it represented an impressive 25-fold increase from only five years ago.\n\nWhile the broader non-alcoholic beverage industry might be extremely mature, the energy drink category is registering faster growth. Perhaps consumers aren't interested in drinking sugary beverages as much as they were 10 or 20 years ago. Or maybe there's simply a heightened focus on drinks that are supposedly healthier for you.\n\nThis is what Celsius aims to be. By marketing its products as functional beverages that have certain health benefits, it has steadily gained consumer mindshare. Any consumer-facing brand should strive to do just this.\n\nCelsius has also benefited from getting its drinks in front of more customers. This means expanding its presence in various retail settings. The business is also finding tremendous success on Amazon, an extremely popular e-commerce site that gets billions of visitors each month.\n\nAnd with the help of PepsiCo, which is Celsius' distribution partner both domestically and abroad, this company is in a favorable position to keep finding success.\n\nIs it too late to buy Celsius stock?\n\nSince hitting their all-time high in March of this year, Celsius shares have been nosediving, tanking 42% in less than five weeks. On May 28, Dara Mohsenian, a research analyst at Morgan Stanley, published a note that said the company's sales fell sequentially during the week ending May 18, causing Celsius' market share to dip slightly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even after its monumental decline, I still believe Celsius is an overvalued stock. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 61.6. That's a steep valuation to pay, particularly as sales are slowing down. And I think it gives prospective investors zero margin of safety.\n\nCelsius is expected to increase revenue at an annualized clip of 31% between 2023 and 2026. This is a far cry from the triple-digit growth investors have probably become accustomed to.\n\nWhat also worries me is that these projections could prove to be overly optimistic. Celsius has likely already taken advantage of the so-called low-hanging-fruit opportunity with its Pepsi deal. Moreover, the industry has virtually no barriers to entry. There's nothing stopping a well-funded entrepreneur from starting his or her own energy drink business, which consumers could flock to.\n\nCelsius has undoubtedly been a fantastic investment in the past decade, turning a small sum into nearly $3 million. But the stock doesn't look like a smart buying opportunity today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world",
        "body": "The unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.\n\nFour small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.\n\nThe saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.\n\nRegulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse\u2019s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.\n\n'Banking as a service'\n\nSynapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.\n\nIn just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called \"banking as a service.\"\n\nIt provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that in return got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.\n\nThe traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks when compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).\n\nThe largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was \"we\u2019ll bring in the deposits; you don\u2019t have to do much,\" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.\n\n\"This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,\" Mikula added.\n\nJelena McWilliams, former FDIC chair, is trustee in the Synapse bankruptcy. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nThe problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.\n\nThree weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.\n\nBoth parties blamed each other as the culprit.\n\n\"Synapse\u2019s abrupt shutdown of essential systems without notice and failure to provide necessary records needlessly jeopardized end users by hindering our ability to verify transactions, confirm end user balances, and comply with applicable law,\" Evolve said in a statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nSynapse CEO Sankaet Pathak rebuked this claim, accusing Evolve of having the means to settle a deficit yet delaying the return of customer funds.\n\n\"The debtor has been forced to play a perverse game of 'whack-a-mole' with unreasonable demands from Evolve as conditions to unfreezing the depositor accounts, all while the depositors suffer lack of access to their funds,\" Pathak stated in court documents last month.\n\nThe end result is that thousands of fintech customers lost access to their money.\n\n\u201cSynapse\u2019s bankruptcy has left tens of thousands of end-users of financial technology platforms that were customers of Synapse stranded without access to their funds,\u201d Jelena McWilliams, the court-appointed trustee to Synapse and a former FDIC chair, wrote in a letter last week to the heads of five federal banking regulators.\n\nThere was another problem: No one seemed to know where all of the money was.\n\nMcWilliams in early June said there was a shortfall of $85 million, with the four banks only accounting for $180 million of the $265 million belonging to end users.\n\nMore recently she said the range of the shortfall was $65 million to $96 million.\n\nSome money has been paid back to customers. McWilliams said on June 21 that more than $100 million \"has been distributed by certain of the partner banks.\"\n\nBlind spots\n\nBank regulators have been concerned for some time about the partnerships between Silicon Valley-style digital startups and FDIC-backed banks.\n\nActing Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu used a September 2023 speech to discuss the potential blind spots for regulators as these relationships become more blurry.\n\n\u201cBanks and tech firms, in an effort to provide a \u2018seamless\u2019 customer experience, are teaming up in ways that make it more difficult for customers, regulators, and the industry to distinguish between where the bank stops and where the tech firm starts,\u201d Hsu said in the speech.\n\nLast June, regulators issued final joint guidance on how lenders should handle these relationships.\n\nThese partnerships are not yet widespread across the entire banking industry, even though the use of this model is accelerating while banks of all sizes seek ways to attract deposits and earn more revenue.\n\nActing Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu has raised concerns about the ties between banks and fintech firms. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFewer than 2% of US banks used the banking-as-a-service model in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBut regulators are nonetheless getting more aggressive about calling out such relationships. The banking-as-a-service model accounted for 13.5% of public enforcement actions from regulators in 2023, according to S&P.\n\nIn January, the FDIC issued a consent order to one of Synapse\u2019s partner banks, Franklin, Tenn.-based Lineage, that identified weaknesses related to its banking-as-a-service program and ordered the bank to come up with a plan for how to achieve an \"orderly termination\" with significant fintech partners.\n\nThe next month, New York City-based Piermont Bank; Attica, Ohio-based Sutton Bank; and Martinsville, Va.-based Blue Ridge Bank received consent orders from regulators related to alleged deficiencies in their banking-as-a-service business.\n\nThen, earlier this month, the Fed issued an enforcement action against Evolve, saying that examinations conducted in 2023 \"found that Evolve engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices by failing to have in place an effective risk management framework\" for its partnerships with fintech companies.\n\nRegulators asked Evolve to improve its policies and risk management practices \"by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships.\" They also noted that the action was \"independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evolve said the recent order was \"similar to orders received by others in the industry\" and \"does not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits.\"\n\nThe bank counts Affirm (AFRM), Mastercard (MA), and Stripe as notable fintech partnerships on its website.\n\nIt has also in the past partnered with two crypto firms that went bankrupt, FTX and BlockFi, as well as Bytechip, a financial services firm had its accounts with Evolve frozen late last year on the allegation it violated federal law by laundering money for fraudsters.\n\nTo add to its recent challenges, Evolve said this past Wednesday that some customer data was illegally spread on the dark web as a result of \"a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization.\"\n\n\"Evolve has engaged the appropriate law enforcement authorities to aid in our investigation and response efforts,\" the bank said. \"This incident has been contained, and there is no ongoing threat.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "1 No-Brainer EV Stock to Buy Right Now for Less Than $200",
        "body": "Owning Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock is not for the faint of heart, even after a recent $5 billion cash infusion from Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY). But if you are a more aggressive investor, that cash lifeline could be exactly what Rivian needs to create a profitable business.\n\nThe future for this stock looks far brighter now than it did before the Volkswagen agreement -- and it still trades for well below $200 a share, even after a big stock rally. Here's why this electric vehicle (EV) stock might be a great buy right now if you have $200 available to invest.\n\nWhat has Rivian accomplished?\n\nIt is important to give Rivian the credit it deserves, despite the fact that the business continues to bleed red ink. Losses in startups aren't shocking at all, given the magnitude of trying to build an electric carmaker from the ground up. That said, Rivian makes highly desirable EV trucks. They have won multiple industry awards, which suggests that Rivian's products are good.\n\nImage source: Rivian.\n\nMore important than the awards, Rivian has started to produce at scale. In 2023, it made roughly 57,000 vehicles. That's a large number and proves that the company can execute on a plan.\n\nIn 2024, the plan shifted gears from ramping up production to turning a profit on each vehicle it builds. The new direction included cutting costs, upgrading its manufacturing processes, and switching to new suppliers.\n\nThe effort to upgrade the company's production processes was a near-term headwind and helped lead to a loss of nearly $39,000 on every vehicle it sold in the first quarter of 2024. That's not great, but it was a necessary step as the company works toward turning a gross profit on each vehicle by the end of 2024. That's not the same as being profitable at the company level, but it is the next step toward that goal.\n\nPut simply, management is doing a decent job of achieving the goals it is setting out for itself, and that is moving the company slowly toward being a sustainably profitable venture.\n\nSolving a big problem with Volkswagen's money\n\nThe race for Rivian has long been between time and money. To put a figure on that, the cash and marketable securities listed on the company's balance sheet fell roughly $1.5 billion in the first quarter to roughly $7.8 billion. Although you have to take into account the capital spending in the quarter on the plant upgrade, cash was getting increasingly tight.\n\nThat's where Volkswagen comes in, as it just offered Rivian a lifeline. The complete deal is for up to $5 billion in cash. The first part of that comes in the form of a convertible note. The rest is related to a proposed joint venture between the two companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first cash from the joint venture agreement is going to be a $1 billion purchase of Rivian stock in 2025. Another $1 billion purchase is set to take place in 2026. The remaining $2 billion will take the form of an investment in the joint venture and another loan, which will be made available in 2026.\n\nRivian will still be burning through cash as it builds out its business, but now it has cash coming in to replace what it spends, as well as a large, established partner in the auto sector. Assuming things go as planned, as there are still issues to iron out and regulatory approvals to get, working with Volkswagen could, at some point, dramatically improve Rivian's financial position and maybe even its ability to distribute its products.\n\nThe future has brightened for Rivian\n\nRivian shares rallied dramatically on news of the Volkswagen agreement, which shouldn't be a big surprise. It is still only appropriate for aggressive investors, but if that's the camp you fall into, well, Rivian has secured an important financial lifeline and an important partner. That materially increases the likelihood that Rivian succeeds in its goal of becoming a profitable EV maker.\n\nIf you don't want to buy the stock on this news, that's understandable. The two companies still need to work out the final details. But keep an eye on the company. A modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of the year is the next big milestone, and that could be what ends up convincing you to climb on board.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "AMD Stock Just Dipped. Is 2024 the Time to Invest?",
        "body": "Shares in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have tumbled 11% in the last three months.\n\nThe company has been a leading recipient of the recent boom in artificial intelligence (AI), with its stock up 147% since the start of 2023. AMD enjoyed a lot of sympathy growth as its rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), dominated the AI chip market. Because AMD is a leading chipmaker with the second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs), Wall Street hoped it would follow in Nvidia's footsteps.\n\nHowever, a mediocre earnings release alongside stellar growth from Nvidia suggests AMD could face challenges in the coming years. So, the question is whether it's worth making a long-term investment in AMD now while it's down or opting for an alternative way to gain exposure to the same markets.\n\nAMD stock just dipped, so is 2024 the time to invest? Let's assess.\n\nAMD's latest earnings release didn't do much to excite investors\n\nAMD posted its first quarter of 2024 earnings on April 30. Revenue increased by 2% year over year to $5 billion, beating analysts' expectations by $20 million. The company enjoyed solid gains in its data center and client segments, with revenue soaring 80% and 85% year over year. However, it was hit hard by more than 40% declines in its gaming and embedded divisions.\n\nOverall, the company's quarter was just fine. It beat revenue and earnings-per-share forecasts. However, AMD's performance was dwarfed by Nvidia's 262% year-over-year increase in revenue in the same quarter. And AMD isn't just having trouble keeping up in AI. While the company's gaming sales plunged, Nvidia's gaming segment posted gains of 18% during the same period.\n\nAMD Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nConsistent differences in the companies' growth have led AMD's free cash flow to fall 52% since 2021, while Nvidia's skyrocketed 490%. The chart above illustrates Nvidia's massive lead over AMD by this metric, suggesting Nvidia is better financially equipped to keep expanding its chip business and retain its market dominance.\n\nAMD remains a prominent chipmaker with positions throughout tech, from PC gaming to consoles, data centers, consumer products like laptops, and more. However, the looming threat of Nvidia means AMD will need to differentiate itself in the industry and give customers a reason to choose its products.\n\nCompeting in AI will likely be an uphill battle\n\nNvidia has cornered the market on AI GPUs, snapping up an estimated 70% to 95% share of the industry. The sector is expanding quickly, suggesting there should be room for the company to retain its lead and welcome newcomers like AMD. However, past trends in the chip market indicate AMD will have a mountain to climb if its goal is ever to dethrone its biggest rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has held a majority market share in discrete GPUs for at least the last decade, with its share rising from 65% to 88%. Meanwhile, since 2014, AMD's position in the market has fallen from 35% to 12% in Q1 2024.\n\nAMD has similarly had trouble overtaking Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the central processing unit (CPU) industry. AMD's Ryzen processors were a hit when they launched in 2017, with the company's CPU market share rising from 18% to 33% since then. Yet, Intel has managed to hang on to its leading role, with a 64% share in CPUs as of this year, proving it can be near impossible to lose dominance in a chip sector once you've achieved it. The data suggests Nvidia will retain its AI chip dominance, making it challenging for AMD to see significant growth in the industry.\n\nMoreover, AMD is a hard sell as it struggles to differentiate itself from the competition. While Nvidia is leading in GPUs, chip rival Intel is developing its own AI chips and expanding into manufacturing. Intel has plans to open plants throughout the U.S., with hopes of becoming the AI chip fab of the nation. The move could allow it to profit from rising AI chip demand throughout the industry as companies like Nvidia and AMD outsource their manufacturing. Alternatively, AMD has yet to find a niche to dominate in AI as it continues to develop chips to compete with Nvidia and Intel's offerings.\n\nAs a result, AMD's two biggest competitors look like potentially better investments as the AI market develops.\n\nAMD PE Ratio Chart\n\nTo add insult to injury, AMD's stock offers far less value than its peers. This chart shows AMD has the highest price-to-earnings ratio alongside Nvidia and Intel, making their stocks look like bargains in comparison.\n\nSo, despite its recent dip, I'd hold off buying AMD stock for now and consider loading up on better-valued options.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

Owners Tata had threatened to bring forward the planned closure of both remaining blast furnaces the day before the strike, citing safety fears due to a staff walkout. Unite\u2019s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closure of blast furnace number four which was not due to be shut down until September. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that would give them time for more negotiations to extend the life of the remaining furnace with a potentially new government in place.\n\nFurther talks to take place\n\nThe government has promised a \u00a3500m grant towards the development of a new \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace which recycles scrap metal, is less energy intensive, but requires far fewer staff. The closure of both furnaces would cost 2,800 jobs while extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace had been built on the site, which could take up to three years. Sources close to the matter told the BBC that Unite had given Tata the perfect excuse to shut down early, accelerating job losses. But Unite officials rejected that, saying their action \u201chad helped focus minds\u201d and they are claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.",

        "title": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide",
        "body": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\n\n4 hours ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \"stretched\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \"broadly stable\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \u00a3266,064, the lender said.\n\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \"broadly flat\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\". \"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\n\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \"Either way, we\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\" Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \u00a31.2bn in May, from \u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\n\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable",

        "title": "Energy price cap change mean lower bills but relief may be temporary",
        "body": "Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\n\n12 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\n\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \u00a31,723 in October, a \u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\n\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\n\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\n\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\n\nLatest changes in detail\n\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\n\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\n\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \u00a31,522\n\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \u00a31,668\n\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\n\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down",

        "body": "Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\n\n7 hours ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \"strenuously object to this plea deal\"\n\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \"sweetheart plea deal\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \"directly from the Justice Department\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\n\n'Families will object to this deal'\n\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\u00a319.6bn) for \"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\".",

        "body": "Will Biden's green jobs policy help him win votes?\n\n12 hours ago By Michelle Fleury , North America Business correspondent Share\n\nBBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia\n\nThe former \u201ccarpet capital of the world\u201d is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2013 his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.\n\nThe most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year\u2019s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn\u2019t appear to have lifted the incumbent\u2019s support. President Biden\u2019s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it\u2019s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.\n\nQcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables\n\nScott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an \u201caccelerant\u201d. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. \u201cWhat our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,\u201d he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals \u2013 not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: \u201cIn the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].\u201d Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. \u201cThe business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,\u201d says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump\u2019s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. \u201cNobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the \u2018latte liberals\u2019 care about in the big city.\u201d\n\nQcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton\n\nWell, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It\u2019s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump\u2019s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden\u2019s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton\u2019s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Caf\u00e9, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn\u2019t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be speaking with the Trump team\u201d. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton\u2019s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of \u201csolar panel capital of the world\u201d.\n\nBut that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world\u2019s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US\u2019s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the \u201csignificant distortion\u201d in the global economy caused by China.\n\nKasey Carpenter, a Republican, says he is not fearful that a possible Trump government would hit the solar sector",

        "body": "The big problem facing whoever wins the election\n\n1 day ago By Faisal Islam , @faisalislam, Economics editor Share\n\nGetty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility\n\nAmid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon\u2019s Honda factory - once one of the world\u2019s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK\u2019s famous boom towns.\n\nA view of shuttered shops on a Swindon street\n\nThe Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday\u2019s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world\u2019s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.\n\nFaisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon\n\nMarcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still \u201cgood employment prospects\u201d but says many are at or \u201c50p above\u201d minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,\u201d he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. \u201cWe were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I\u2019ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,\u201d Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? \u201cIf I\u2019m unlucky, I\u2019m getting unlucky every single day and I\u2019m probably the unluckiest person on earth,\u201d she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.\n\nFormer Honda worker turned cafe-owner Marcus Kittridge\n\nGary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon\u2019s town centre looked like it was \u201crotting\u201d and asked if anything could change. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.\u201d\n\nGary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is \"rotting\"\n\nThe Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year\u2019s brief recession. Swindon\u2019s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of \u201cI\u2019m not defeatist\u201d or \u201cwe can do it\u201d. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style \"Big Bang\". She told me: \u201cIt\u2019s big reform we are offering\u2026 unless we grow the economy we\u2019re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.\u201d Labour\u2019s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.",

From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at \u00a35. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. \u201cThrough the launch of our repair service, we\u2019re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London\u2019s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

        "body": "Tata offers to meet unions if strike called off\n\n14 hours ago By Huw Thomas , BBC Wales business correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs\n\nTata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: \"They suspend closure, we suspend action.\"\n\nUnite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community\u2019s national officer, said the letter \"simply reaffirms\" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was \"welcome\" Unite were \"reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed\", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.\n\nGetty Images Tata has previously said it is losing \u00a31m a day in Port Talbot",

        "body": "Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases\n\n3 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.\n\nHow do you treat E. coli and what are the symptoms?",

        "title": "Affordable home residents in Edinburgh hit by 450% gas price rise",
        "body": "Affordable home families hit by 450% gas price rise\n\n1 day ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share\n\nBBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'\n\nResidents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are \"living in a horror story\" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as \u00a3400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.\n\nSome of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices\n\nJakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from \u00a360 to \u00a3350. He said: \"These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. \"The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. \"We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property.\" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. \"We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,\" he said. \"People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. \"It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. \"It is really desperate.\"\n\nHenda Sankareh said she got the \"fright of her life\" at the new gas prices\n\nThe price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the \"fright of her life\" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: \"They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. \"That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.\"\n\nScott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly\n\nAfter residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: \"The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. \"Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate.\" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: \"I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. \"We can't afford to move. He added: \"When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. \"We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. \"I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.\"\n\nAngela Stevenson said she would fight the price rise",

        "title": "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early",
        "body": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n3 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",

        "body": "More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights\n\nAer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the \u201cindefinite nature\u201d of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots\u2019 industrial action it \u201cmust cancel\u201d additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I\u2019m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they\u2019ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. \u201cTrying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: \u2018Because you\u2019re a group we can\u2019t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don\u2019t open until 9am\u2019.\u201d Mr McWatters told the BBC\u2019s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been \u201cleft high and dry\u201d, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. \u201cAt that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,\u201d he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had \u201cfallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children\u201d. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don\u2019t meet you, we do every day. \"We\u2019ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we\u2019re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don\u2019t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union F\u00f3rsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RT\u00c9 has reported. If sanctioned, F\u00f3rsa will have to give seven days\u2019 notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is \"willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis\". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and F\u00f3rsa to \"agree to this step\".\n\nHow many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?\n\nAll Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about \u20ac36,000 (\u00a330,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about \u20ac287,000 (\u00a3242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nWhat do I do if my Aer Lingus flight is cancelled?",

Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

        "title": "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal",
        "body": "Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\n\n4 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\n\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\" she said. \"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\"\n\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \"releases\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \" he wrote. \"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\".\n\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\n\nGetty Images",

        "body": "IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\n\n4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\n\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \"clearly\" wanted him to say that \"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\".\n\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\n\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \"perfect\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \"fairly chaotic\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\". Mr Jenkins said this was \"totally inappropriate wording\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \"afflicted\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \"other reasons\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\n\nGuidance sought\n\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data \u201cprobably needs some further investigation\u201d. However, he said the decision to do so would be \u201chighly political\u201d. \"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \"what exactly we should be doing\". Mr Beer asked: \"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\" Mr Jenkins replied: \"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\" \"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\" Mr Jenkins responded: \"I don't know what to say to that.\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\n\n'I can't remember what I believed'",

        "body": "'How will we afford children with rent increases?'\n\n4 days ago By Alix Hattenstone, Miguel Roca-Terry and Jonathan Fagg , BBC England Data Unit Share\n\nDelia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage\n\nThe average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost \u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \u201cchronic shortage\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\n\n'All of us have been homeless'\n\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \u201cI was looking at my friends \u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\u2019t afford a house?\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \u00a31,312 to \u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\n\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\n\nHow has rent changed in your area?\n\nWhy has rent been increasing?\n\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \"geometric average\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\" he said. \"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\n\nWhere has rent increased the most?\n\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \u00a3555 in December 2019, to \u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\n\n'It was like a bidding war'\n\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \u2018mini budget\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth. This included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed \"Liz Truss' botched budget\" for \"driving up rents for tenants\" and a Labour spokesperson said \"time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters\". A Conservative Party spokesman said \u201cCovid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels\u201d, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. \u201cPeople were offering over the asking price or six months\u2019 rent up front.

        "title": "Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?",
        "body": "Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?\n\n4 days ago By Kevin Keane , BBC Scotland environment correspondent Share\n\nPA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing\n\n\"Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?\" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \"unlicenced\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\n\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\n\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\n\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \"at risk\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\n\nJob forecasts",

        "title": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?",
        "body": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?\n\n4 days ago By Emma Woollacott , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores\n\nAmazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.\n\nAmazon was quick to claim that the reports were \u201cerroneous\u201d, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that \u201cthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common\u201d. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question \u2013 whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d in reference to the environmental \"green washing\".\n\nBut first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called \"generative AI\". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. \"Some founders seem to believe that if they don\u2019t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,\" says Mr Ayangar. \"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.\"\n\nSri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI\n\nIt is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as \"AI start-ups\" in fact used virtually no AI at all. \"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,\" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that \"cutting-edge AI capabilities\" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.\n\nDouglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. \"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. \"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.\" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: \"If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.\"\n\nRegulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. \"The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,\" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nNick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem",

        "body": "The screen tech that can do almost anything\n\n7 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nLink\u00f6ping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. \u201cThis is difficult but we think it\u2019s possible.\" In today\u2019s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone\u2019s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice demonstration\u2026 it\u2019s very new,\u201d says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled \u2013 at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. \u201cBy slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,\u201d says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. \u201cIf you think about mass production, this is gigantic.\u201d There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable \u2013 they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue \u2013 the key hues required for full colour digital displays.\n\nTo keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there\u2019s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn\u2019t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV\u2019s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It\u2019s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today\u2019s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.\n\nHelio Helio's film can re-emit blue light as either red or green with little light loss\n\nThe technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren\u2019t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.",

        "title": "Europeans suffer from \u2018vacation deprivation,\u2019 despite working less and having more time off than their American and Japanese peers",
        "body": "In the eyes of many, Europe is viewed as a vacation dreamland, with its liberal holiday allowances and a culture that heavily promotes work-life balance.\n\nBut if you ask Europeans, they might disagree. As far as they are concerned, they\u2019re not getting nearly enough vacation days\u2014even as they\u2019re getting the most among some of their peers, a new Expedia report shows.\n\nGermans and French have among the most generous annual leave periods, with 31 and 33 days, respectively. That\u2019s over a month in both cases\u2014two-and-a-half times the number of days the U.S. employees get. Yet, a survey of over 11,500 employees worldwide revealed that workers in Germany and France report not having enough vacation time.\n\nIn contrast, their American and Japanese peers take significantly fewer days off work and seem largely satisfied with it. While 65% of U.S. and 53% of Japanese employees feel deprived of a vacation, that figure climbs to 84% among Germans and 69% for the French.\n\nMore time off certainly doesn\u2019t address the larger question of work-life balance, as some European employees are left wanting more. But what explains this divergence?\n\nIt turns out that people\u2019s attitudes toward vacation and its place in each country\u2019s culture dictate why they feel deprived of their downtime.\n\nIf you consider the U.S., employees work longer hours, according to OECD data. In 2022, the average worker spent 1,811 hours working through the year compared to 1,341 hours and 1,511 hours in Germany and France, respectively.\n\nCall it what you will, whether that\u2019s ambition\u2014or its lack thereof, as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said in April, it\u2019s what distinguishes the workers\u2019 attitudes.\n\n\u201cParticularly in America, there\u2019s an \u2018ideal worker\u2019 norm, and we feel pressure to look committed to the job at all times,\u201d Dr. Mindy Shoss, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida, said to Expedia. The reason Americans cited for not taking enough time off was \u201clife is too busy to plan or go on vacation,\u201d the travel company\u2019s 24th iteration of the \u201cVacation Deprivation\u201d report found.\n\nOn the contrary, vacations are seen as a \u201cbasic right\u201d in France, Christie Hudson, Expedia\u2019s head of public relations, told Fortune last month. They\u2019re also seen as a crucial aspect of overall well-being, which isn\u2019t valid to the same extent in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe distinctly French emphasis on the fundamental right to rest is one to adopt everywhere,\u201d the Expedia report said.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nFrance has become known as one of the least workaholic nations, with many people taking time off and working fewer hours.\n\nHowever, more generally, studies have found that European culture accommodates work-life balance more than the U.S. Countries like the U.K. have a statutory requirement entitling workers to 28 days off.\n\nThe approach is straightforward for Europeans: As long as people meet the subsistence level, they choose free time over wealth creation, unlike their American counterparts who prioritize the opposite, the Financial Times reported.\n\nEven when Americans choose to take vacations, rest and relaxation are often not a priority, making it harder to unplug. This explains the desire for more time off.\n\nIf we widen our gaze further, countries like Hong Kong and Japan offer unique lessons on how best to utilize the time workers get\u2014whether that\u2019s a little or a lot.\n\nHong Kong-based workers systematically plan their time off, often around public holidays, to maximize their vacations. That\u2019s how they have no leftover days on average, and the same is true of Singapore.\n\nIn Japan, where workers get roughly 19 days off a year, seven days go unused, according to Expedia. Still, Japanese employees feel the least deprived of vacations. The trick? Taking short, but frequent breaks between work to make the most of time off.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, people take time off every month instead of just twice a year. For the French, not even a full month of vacation feels like enough time,\u201d Melanie Fish, Expedia brands public relations head said.\n\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s a lot for the U.S. to borrow from, whether it\u2019s spreading your PTO throughout the year or prioritizing rest on your next vacation.\u201d",

        "body": "Jimmy Donaldson has in the past been criticized for using the $700 million fortune amassed by his work on YouTube to right social inequalities. But the 26-year-old, who goes by the online moniker \u2018MrBeast\u2019 has a question: what would you have him do instead?\n\nThe creator posted on X this week about the backlash he has received on videos such as \u2018I built 100 homes and gave them away\u2019 and \u20181,000 blind people see for the first time.\u2019\n\nBut the content creator\u2014who has launched a philanthropic arm to his brand\u2014is determined to keep up the work in the same vain as many high net worth individuals before him.\n\nPosting on the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Donaldson wrote on Sunday: \u201cWhen we help people (curing 1,000 blind people, building 100 houses, 100 wells, etc) people get mad and say I shouldn\u2019t be doing this and governments should.\n\n\u201cYes, ideally a YouTuber isn\u2019t the one fixing these issues but I\u2019m not just gonna stand by and do nothing.\u201d\n\nMrBeast\u2019s blindness video, posted on Jan. 28, 2023, sparked a debate about the ethics of influencers making content about philanthropic deeds. Donaldson was accused of \u201cmaking content out of people who can\u2019t see.\u201d Others added: \u201cNow you have to be filmed for a YouTube video to get vision.\u201d\n\nThe influencer, who sleeps in his North Carolina studio to cut down on driving time to the office, hit back in February 2023. Again posting on X, he wrote: \u201cTwitter \u2013 Rich people should help others with their money.\n\n\u201cMe \u2013 Okay, I\u2019ll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.\n\n\u201cTwitter \u2013 MrBeast bad.\u201d\n\nTwitter \u2013 Rich people should help others with their money\n\n\n\nMe \u2013 Okay, I\u2019ll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.\n\n\n\nTwitter \u2013 MrBeast bad \u2014 MrBeast (@MrBeast) January 30, 2023\n\nEven Donaldson, who has grown his business empire with the likes of a burger brand \u2018MrBeast Burgers\u2019 and snacking brand \u2018Feastables\u2019, has questioned before why individuals are stepping in to bridge inequalities that should, in theory, be addressed by governments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why curable blindness is a thing,\u201d Mr Beast wrote on X. \u201cWhy don\u2019t governments step in and help? Even if you\u2019re thinking purely from a financial standpoint it\u2019s hard to see how they don\u2019t ROI on taxes from people being able to work again.\u201d\n\nGovernment and philanthropy\n\nThe confusion Donaldson experienced was encountered by another famous pair of philanthropists when they began their foundation: Bill and Melinda Gates.\n\nThe Microsoft co-founder wrote that in 1993 when the entrepreneur and his then-wife first visited Africa they assumed that \u201cif millions of children were dying, there would be massive worldwide effort to save them.\u201d The deaths of these children occurred because of a range of reasons: measles, malaria, hepatitis B, yellow fever and rotavirus\u2014a diarrhea and vomiting sickness which many children in the western world are vaccinated against.\n\n\u201cBut we were wrong,\u201d wrote the tech titan on his blog, GatesNotes, in 2012.\n\nThe man worth $157 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index wrote that governments face a range of obstacles when it comes to funding the innovation needed to beat such inequalities. These range from being risk adverse to having a short-term lens prompted by election cycles.\n\nOn top of that, the father-of-three wrote the private sector will only invest so much in such innovations because businesses would shoulder all the risk while benefitting from a diminished level of returns.\n\n\u201cSo when you come to the end of the innovations that business and government are willing to invest in, you still find a vast, unexplored space of innovation where the returns can be fantastic. This space is a fertile area for what I call catalytic philanthropy,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe investor doesn\u2019t need a share of the benefits\u2014those go to poor people, or sick people or society generally, all of whom stand to gain earth-shaking returns from the kind of innovations that business and government likely won\u2019t pursue unless philanthropy goes first. And once you\u2019ve found a solution that works, catalytic philanthropy can harness political and market forces to get those innovations to the people who need them most.\u201d",

        "title": "DGT: Federal Reserve\u2019s Eventual Rate Cut Should Act As A Catalyst (NYSEARCA:DGT)",
        "body": "busracavus\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nSPDR Global Dow ETF (NYSEARCA:DGT) invests in a portfolio of about 150 large-cap global stocks. The fund has a higher concentration of U.S. stocks as these stocks represent over half of its portfolio. DGT's sectors allocation shows that it has a higher exposure to cyclical sectors than defensive sectors. Fortunately, the global economy appears to be improving. In addition, an eventual rate cut by the Federal Reserve should act as a catalyst to lift DGT's fund price higher. Therefore, we think investors should take advantage of any pullbacks.\n\nFund Analysis\n\nDGT has performed quite well in this bull market\n\nDGT has performed quite well since the broader market reached its cyclical low in late 2022. As the chart below illustrates, DGT's fund price has increased by about 53.0% but still lag the S&P 500 index's 57.3%.\n\nYCharts\n\nMany people will wonder how DGT will perform in the second half of 2024 and beyond. This is what we will discuss in the rest of this article.\n\nHalf of its portfolio belong to U.S. stocks\n\nLet us first look at DGT's portfolio composition by geography. As can be seen from the table below, stocks from the U.S. represent about 52.6% of DGT's portfolio. This is followed by Japan's 9.2% and U.K.'s 7.1%. While U.S. stocks represent a large chunk of DGT's portfolio, we are not particularly concerned. Most of these U.S. stocks have sizable businesses outside of the U.S. already. Therefore, we do not see this as a concern.\n\nSPDR\n\nSector allocation is quite balanced\n\nNext, we will look at DGT's sector allocation. As can be seen from the chart below, the fund's sectors are quite balanced. Only financials sector has a weight exceed 20%. All other sectors have weights below 15%. About 37.2% of its portfolio (financials, consumer discretionary, materials, and real estate sectors) are highly sensitive to business cycle peaks and troughs. In contrast, 20.2% of DGT's portfolio (health care, utilities, consumer staples sectors) belong to defensive sectors. The rest other sectors belong to sectors that are moderate sensitive to business cycle peaks and troughs.\n\nSPDR\n\nSince DGT's portfolio has a higher exposure to cyclical sectors, we need to pay attention to where we are in this economic cycle. The best time to invest in this fund is when the economy is in the trough, or when the economy is climbing out of the trough but not yet reach the peak. Having this in mind, we will evaluate where we are in this global economy cycle.\n\nThe global economy is improving\n\nTo evaluate where we are in this economy cycle, we will invite readers to take a look at the global composite PMI. This indicator is a forward economic indicator that helps us to gauge the strength of the economy. A PMI value above 50 means the economy is heading into expansion mode. On the other hand, a value below 50 means the economy is heading towards contraction. As can be seen from the chart below, the global economy has clearly walked out of the low reached in November 2022. Although the ride can be a bit bumpy since late 2022, the global economy is clearly recovering. In fact, global composite PMI reading in May is 53.7. This is much higher than April's 52.4. This significant improvement is due to accelerating growth in both manufacturing and services. While one may think that this reading is high, it is still much lower than the peak of 58.5 reached in May 2021.\n\nTrading Economics\n\nWe like DGT's portfolio as it may benefit from the eventual rate cut\n\nSince nearly half of DGT's portfolio includes international stocks, its fund price will inevitably be impacted by currency exchange rates. We can quickly see this relationship in the chart below. This chart basically illustrates how DGT's fund price has been impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. As can be seen from the chart, DGT's fund price has an inverse correlation to the strength/weakness of the U.S. dollar. As the U.S. dollar strengthens (e.g. when the Federal Reserve raise the rate), DGT's fund price tend to decline. On the other hand, when the U.S. dollar weakens (e.g. when the Federal Reserve cut the rate), DGT's fund price tend to move up.\n\nYCharts\n\nWe have been watching closely about when the Federal Reserve will cut the rate. The recent core PCE data is quite welcoming as we see core PCE continue to trend lower. As the chart below shows, core PCE reading in May is 2.6% and this is the lowest we have seen since the first half of 2021. This gives us more confidence that the Federal Reserve will eventually begin a new rate cut cycle this coming fall. A new rate cut cycle usually also means that the U.S. dollar will gradually weaken. This should be quite beneficial to DGT's fund price especially that the global economy appears to be improving.\n\nTrading Economics\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nWe think DGT will benefit from an improving global economic outlook. An eventual rate cut (we think will happen in Fall 2024) by the Federal Reserve should also act as a catalyst to DGT's fund price. Therefore, investors may want to take advantage of any pullbacks.",

        "title": "My Best Dividend Aristocrats For July 2024",
        "body": "undefined/iStock via Getty Images\n\n2024 Review\n\nA positive trajectory resumed for the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) during the month of May. The ETF posted a modest gain of 1.45% during the month. Albeit some of this optimism has faded in June with the ETF sitting in the red near the end of the month. Year-to-date, through June 26th NOBL is up 2.44%.\n\nSeveral dividend aristocrats are running at a much faster pace than NOBL in 2024. Let's take a look at which individual aristocrats are driving the ETFs return through month-end May. The following 33 aristocrats are all outperforming NOBL (+3.40% - Jan - May) this year:\n\nTICKER YTD 24 NEE 32.98% BRO 26.29% WMT 25.99% DOV 20.55% CB 20.23% XOM 19.35% CL 17.99% ECL 17.35% GD 16.63% EMR 16.36% CAT 15.43% CINF 14.42% CHD 13.78% PG 13.72% CTAS 12.96% PNR 12.61% GWW 11.65% S&P 11.30% TGT 11.21% CVX 11.07% KMB 10.78% TROW 10.60% AFL 10.26% AMCR 8.31% KO 7.64% LIN 6.37% MKC 6.14% ABBV 6.06% ESS 5.85% ED 5.83% ADP 5.74% GPC 4.77% IBM 3.96% Click to enlarge\n\nThe S&P 500, as measured by SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), gained 5.06% in May, outperforming NOBL during the month. SPY is also thus far enjoying a much more robust return in June, +3.31% through June 26th. The dividend aristocrats are not known to consistently beat the S&P 500 index, in fact, the dividend aristocrat index underperformed the S&P 500 index for 7 out of the last 9 full calendar years.\n\nHowever, if you look further back in history, the dividend aristocrat index is outperforming the S&P 500 index by about 2.18% per year between 1990 and 2022. A significant portion of this long-term outperformance is attributable to the dot com bubble and the financial crisis, as well as the immediate years following each market crash. This pattern was broken with the 2020 market crash, perhaps the much shorter duration of the crash and recovery are the reason. The dot com bubble and the financial crisis both extended for multiple years, while the 2020 market crash was fully recovered in a matter of months. 2022 also proved to be a strong year for the aristocrats, as they earned 15.15% of alpha on the S&P, making up for 3 years of underperformance.\n\nEven though the dividend aristocrats have trailed the S&P for the better part of the last 9 years, long-term investors can rest assured that based on history, over a much longer time period, the dividend aristocrats can hold their own. There are currently 66 companies in the dividend aristocrat index, but strong historical returns for the index can be attributed to only a handful of them. As an investor, I am always curious how to identify these drivers of outperformance.\n\nSeveral changes were made to the dividend aristocrat list during the course of 2023 and in early 2024. Last year we saw V.F. Corporation (VFC) and Walgreens (WBA) fall off the list. Kenvue (KVUE) joined after it was spun off from Johnson and Johnson. And in early 2024 we welcomed a new dividend aristocrat, Fastenal (FAST). More recently, 3M Company (MMM) announced a dividend cut, and it will lose its aristocrat status after a very impressive streak of 64 years of dividend increases.\n\nI want to present 3 strategies that theoretically could identify winning aristocrats and lead to better performance than the dividend aristocrat index. These strategies work best with a buy-and-hold long-term investing approach, as will be evidenced by the results. They are based on quantitative models that do not consider qualitative data; therefore, it is prudent that further due diligence is performed on all chosen stocks.\n\nThe Most Undervalued Strategy\n\nStrategy number 1 is a focus on valuation, and more specifically it targets the potentially most undervalued dividend aristocrats. In theory, this is a long-term strategy, since it may take some time to fully see the reward of leveraging a valuation approach. My preferred method for valuation is dividend yield theory, mainly for its simplicity. Unlike other valuation methods, dividend yield theory does not require making assumptions aside from assuming that a given stock will revert back to its long-term trailing dividend yield.\n\nThis valuation technique works best for mature businesses with long histories of dividend growth, making the dividend aristocrats an ideal pool of companies to value using this technique.\n\nSelecting the 10 most undervalued dividend aristocrats each month and adopting a buy-and-hold investing approach can lead to long-term outperformance when/if the targeted stocks return to fair valuation. It may take a few months or even years to see if this strategy actually pays off. I predict that it will underperform NOBL for the first few months while we wait for bargain stocks to return to fair value.\n\nMonth Most Undervalued NOBL SPY Jan 24 -2.98% -0.47% 1.59% Feb 24 2.84% 2.72% 5.22% Mar 24 6.70% 4.60% 3.27% Apr 24 -5.33% -4.69% -4.03% May 24 0.41% 1.45% 5.06% Jun 24 -1.76% -0.93% 3.31% 2021 Partial 9.05% 6.54% 9.06% 2022 -3.91% -6.50% -18.16% 2023 4.25% 8.12% 26.18% 2024 -0.58% 2.44% 14.98% TOTAL 8.60% 10.33% 29.49% Alpha over NOBL -1.74% Alpha over SPY -20.90% Click to enlarge\n\nThe table above shows the monthly and annual returns for the buy-and-hold portfolio of the most undervalued strategy.\n\nThe portfolio underperformed NOBL in May by 1.04% and SPY by 4.65%. June, excluding dividends, is thus far looking just as bad, the portfolio is down 1.76% (price only return) through June 26th, while NOBL is down 0.93% and SPY is up 3.31%. Since inception, the portfolio is trailing NOBL by 1.74%, and SPY by 20.90%.\n\nThe 2023 and 2024 tech rally, mainly the magnificent 7, have driven the return of the S&P 500, leaving most other equities in the dust.\n\nAt its peak, this strategy was ahead of both NOBL and SPY by double-digit gains. While such outperformance is not something I am expecting out of this strategy, it has shown merit when stock valuations revert to historical means. It's expected that a strategy based heavily on valuation will cycle in and out of favor. Today, it would appear that the strategy is very unfavorable as the market is highly driven by technology and AI stocks.\n\nThe portfolio consists of 39 unique present and former dividend aristocrats. I track this portfolio by investing $1,000 each month, equally split among the 10 chosen aristocrats for that month. During the month of June, the 3M position in this portfolio was sold and reinvested equally among the 10 June selections.\n\nThis portfolio pays a more attractive dividend yield relative to both NOBL and SPY. Currently, the portfolio has a dividend yield of 3.19%, relative to just 2.09% for NOBL and 1.25% for SPY. In the prior update the portfolio had a dividend yield of 3.39%, this yield dropped significantly following 3M's dividend cut.\n\nHere are the 10 most undervalued dividend aristocrats chosen for the month of July 2024. The table below shows potential undervaluation (column Over/Under) for each of the 10 chosen aristocrats. The image below is taken from a new spreadsheet I recently created where I am self-computing the 5-year trailing dividend yield. Previously, I used Seeking Alpha as a source for the historical yield.\n\nCreated by Author\n\nThe top 10 list has one change compared to the prior month. J.M. Smucker (SJM) is replaced Albermale (ALB).\n\nHere is a closer look at the dividend yield theory valuation for Albermale.\n\nIn the image below, the black line is the actual price since June 2017. The light green shaded area represents a 0 to 15% undervalued zone. The dark green area represents an undervaluation in excess of 15%. The light red-shaded area represents a 0 to 15% overvalued zone.\n\nCreated by Author\n\nThe Fastest Expected Growth Strategy\n\nStrategy number 2 is a focus on dividend aristocrats, who are expected to grow the fastest in the near future. Historically, there has been a correlation between earnings per share growth and share price appreciation. Companies that have grown their earnings faster have also seen higher total returns. One way to gauge how fast earnings for a company will grow is to leverage analyst forecasts. For this strategy, I decided to use a discounted five-year EPS growth forecast combined with a return to fair valuation and the dividend yield to identify the 10 best aristocrats poised for the best total return in the future.\n\nMonth Fastest Growth NOBL SPY Jan 24 0.61% -0.47% 1.59% Feb 24 3.23% 2.72% 5.22% Mar 24 4.97% 4.60% 3.27% Apr 24 -6.79% -4.69% -4.03% May 24 -0.10% 1.45% 5.06% Jun 24 -2.30% -0.93% 3.31% 2021 Partial 11.62% 6.54% 9.06% 2022 -9.86% -6.50% -18.16% 2023 11.58% 8.12% 26.18% 2024 -0.81% 2.44% 14.98% TOTAL 11.36% 10.33% 29.49% Alpha over NOBL 1.03% Alpha over SPY -18.13% Click to enlarge\n\nThe table above shows the monthly and annual returns for the buy-and-hold portfolio of the fastest expected growth strategy.\n\nThe portfolio underperformed NOBL by 1.55% in May and SPY by 5.16%. June thus far is just as bad, through June 26th the portfolio is down 2.30% (price only return) while NOBL is down 0.93% and SPY is up 3.31%. Since inception, the portfolio continues to maintain a modest level of alpha over NOBL, +1.03%, but trails SPY, -18.60%.\n\nThe fastest expected growth portfolio, despite seeing significant losses, is currently performing the best out of the 3 strategies. At one point it trailed the most undervalued strategy by a wide margin, but it fared much better in the most recent market rally.\n\nAll portfolios appear to be struggling this year, especially relative to the S&P 500.\n\nThe portfolio consists of 37 unique present and former dividend aristocrats. I track this portfolio by investing $1,000 each month equally split among the 10 chosen aristocrats for that month. Dividends are reinvested back into the issuing stock, and positions are only trimmed if they lose aristocrat status. This portfolio had a small position, 2.64% allocation, in 3M Company that was liquidated at the end of May and reinvested equally into the 10 chosen aristocrats for the month of June.\n\nIn addition to outperforming NOBL since inception, this portfolio also pays a more attractive dividend yield. Currently, the portfolio has a dividend yield of 2.78%, relative to just 2.09% for NOBL and 1.25% for SPY.\n\nHere are the 10 dividend aristocrats poised for the best total return for the month of July 2024. The table below shows the expected growth rate (column EPS + Valuation) for each of the 10 chosen aristocrats.\n\nCreated by Author\n\nThe top 10 list has one change compared to the prior month. Federal Realty Trust (FRT) is replaced by Albermale (ALB).\n\nThe Blended Strategy\n\nStrategy 3 is a blend of the first two strategies, with a focus on the fastest expected growth but applied only to undervalued aristocrats. A blend of undervaluation and expected growth could narrow down the best aristocrats between the two strategies. The most undervalued aristocrats may not necessarily be poised for the fastest growth. Additionally, targeting only undervalued aristocrats can offer a margin of safety in that securities are purchased for fair or better prices.\n\nMonth Blended NOBL SPY Jan 24 -1.09% -0.47% 1.59% Feb 24 2.69% 2.72% 5.22% Mar 24 5.38% 4.60% 3.27% Apr 24 -5.76% -4.69% -4.03% May 24 0.14% 1.45% 5.06% Jun 24 -0.84% -0.93% 3.31% 2021 Partial 9.18% 6.54% 9.06% 2022 -7.04% -6.50% -18.16% 2023 8.63% 8.12% 26.18% 2024 0.16% 2.44% 14.98% TOTAL 10.43% 10.33% 29.49% Alpha over NOBL 0.10% Alpha over SPY -19.06% Click to enlarge\n\nThe table above shows the monthly and annual returns for the buy-and-hold portfolio of the blended strategy.\n\nThe portfolio underperformed NOBL in May by 1.31% and SPY by 4.92%. June is thus far looking equally bad, the portfolio is down 0.84% (price only return) through June 26th, while NOBL is down 0.93% and SPY is up 3.31%. Since inception, the portfolio is beating NOBL by 0.10% but trailing SPY by 19.06%.\n\nThe blended strategy was an attempt to merge the best of the most undervalued and fastest expected growth strategies. For the longest time, this was the worst-performing strategy, however, since November 2023 this portfolio slid ahead of the most undervalued portfolio and is slowly gaining ground on the fastest expected growth portfolio.\n\nThe portfolio consists of 40 unique present and former dividend aristocrats. I track this portfolio by investing $1,000 each month equally split among the 10 chosen aristocrats for that month. Dividends are reinvested back into the issuing stock, and positions are only trimmed if they lose aristocrat status. Similar to the two prior portfolios, the blended portfolio, had a position in 3M Company that was be liquidated at the end of May.\n\nThis portfolio, similar to the prior two, also pays a more attractive dividend yield relative to NOBL and SPY. Currently, the portfolio has a dividend yield of 2.98%, relative to just 2.09% for NOBL and 1.25% for SPY.\n\nHere are the 10 dividend aristocrats chosen for the blended strategy for July 2024. The table below shows potential undervaluation (column Over/Under) and the expected growth rate (column EPS + Valuation) for each of the 10 chosen aristocrats.\n\nCreated by Author\n\nThe top 10 list has one change compared to the prior month, but since its exactly the same as the fastest expected growth strategy, there are no new charts to present here.\n\nPerformance Review\n\nWe have already seen how the buy-and-hold strategies are performing in June, so now let's look at how the chosen stocks for the month are doing as well. The 10 chosen aristocrats for the most undervalued strategy are down 2.42%, and performing the worst. The fastest expected growth strategy selections are down 2.17%, and since the blended strategy selections for the month were the same, this strategy has the same return. The fastest expected strategy was off to the best start in 2024 however, through June 26th, the most undervalued strategy has taken the lead, +3.80%, relative to +0.62% for the fastest expected growth, and -0.07% for the blended strategy. For perspective, NOBL is up 2.44% this year, while SPY is up a staggering 14.98%.\n\nHere is a comparison of the buy-and-hold portfolios and the individual monthly selections for each strategy. A buy-and-hold approach is a much more tax-friendly investing strategy. It is also working out much better for the most undervalued strategy, but not for the fastest expected growth strategy or the blended strategy.\n\nThe one thing we can glean from the individual selections seeing a higher return than the buy-and-hold portfolios is that newly invested capital is being allocated at much more favorable returns than the buy-and-hold portfolio is experiencing as a whole. This is the case for the fastest growth and blended portfolios, and not for the most undervalued strategy.\n\nType Most Undervalued Fastest Growth Blended NOBL Individual 4.41% 19.57% 12.55% 10.33% Buy-and-Hold 8.60% 11.36% 10.43% 10.33% O/U 4.19% -8.21% -2.11% 0.00% Click to enlarge\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI, personally, believe each of the 3 strategies outlined above can theoretically beat the dividend aristocrat index over a long period of time. These strategies are based on simple principles of valuation and expected returns, and they are easy to understand and implement. Investors should keep in mind that selecting individual stocks carries more risk than investing in an index. The simplest and possibly the safest way to invest in the dividend aristocrats is to purchase shares of NOBL. The fund finished 2021 with a fantastic return, performed much better than the S&P in 2022, and posted a respectable gain in 2023. Since inception, the fund has had an annualized rate of return of 10.29% since inception.\n\n2024 is proving to be another wild year for the stock market, highly driven by technology and AI optimism. I think there is a place for dividend stocks in everyone's portfolio. Dividend investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and you will find yourself in a slow period from time to time. The best course of action is to stick with your long-term strategy, so long as it still fits your long-term objectives.\n\nThe dividend aristocrat data in the images of this article came from my live Google spreadsheet that tracks all the current dividend aristocrats.

        "title": "Mid-America Apartment Communities: The Upside Is Now Over 15% Annually (NYSE:MAA)",
        "body": "Dragon Claws\n\nDear subscribers,\n\nThis week, I wrote an article on Equity Residential, but my primary focus and the REIT I want you to focus on, unless you're already fully invested (like I am), is actually Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA). This is a REIT with an A-rating, sub-38% long-term debt/capital, and a yield that's almost 4.3%. Most of the quality apartment/multifamily REITs are currently seeing yields of around 4-4.5%, some just below, but overall they're more or less at the same specifics.\n\nMAA is like EQR as well as Camden (CPT) and is an A-rated solid multifamily REIT with a very solid portfolio and overall valuation upside - at the right price, which I believe we currently have.\n\nBecause I believe we have this price, I consider the company to be attractive here. This is one of the lowest-leverage REITs in the space, with a current 3.6x net debt to Adj. EBITDAre, and the company has returned a 10-year TSR of 10.2%, better than the market. Also, with 121 consecutive cash dividends since the IPO, the company has not failed to pay out to its shareholders.\n\nWith a current market cap of around $20B and over 102,000 units, the company is larger than some and not as large as others - but where it shines through is valuation upside and consistency.\n\nMid-America Apartments - Good returns since I started buying in fall of 2023\n\nIt was last year during October/November that I seriously started investing in MAA, pushing my stake above 1% for a few simple fundamental reasons, which can be gleaned here.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nAs I've said before, and unlike EQR, MAA doesn't have any West Coast exposure. This is one of the main advantages of the business - all of the markets are growth-oriented markets with very good fundamentals, and the high focus on so-called \"Garden style\" properties is another positive here.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nOut of the company's current balance sheet, there's over 77% common equity with the lion's share of debt unsecured. Only 1.8% of the current debt is subject to securitization, and less than 0.3% is preferred stock.\n\nThere are only eight REITs in the world that are public and have an A rating or above. MAA is one of them, and it has this rating for all three services. The company's maturities are very well-laddered with only one maturing this month, and the company has over $1B of combined cash and capacity available at this time. With a debt/preferred ratio of 22.8% of the total capital, it's no strange thing that the company is being viewed as positive as we're seeing here.\n\nMAA Is also incredibly stable. This is something we can see clearly confirmed here for the quarter as well, which we saw about a month ago with 1Q. Core FFO was in line with expectations - slightly down for 1Q, due to impacts from new supply deliveries in the company's markets. There's a busy summer season coming, and MAA is going into it with already-good occupancy levels.\n\nSame-store revenue grew by 1.4% - below peers, but still good, with a physical occupancy of above 95%, but below 96% - so note that EQR in many areas has been higher, if only slightly. Also, OpEx is increasing more rapidly for MAA than some others, with a 5.4% growth, and well above revenue increase, while the company's NOI is also decreasing slightly.\n\nResident turnover remains very low, but the other trends are currently not exactly favorable, reflecting also the company expectation of an AFFO decline of around 4% for this year, which will not rise back to previous 2023 levels until, at current forecasts, around 2026E.\n\nIt surprises me a little that MAA has not seen more negative trends because of this; instead, it has actually seen valuation slowly climb/increase despite this expected decline. I do not believe it is outside of the realm of possibility for the company to trade \"down\" from her, and given the forecasts, I would even view this as justified.\n\nIt becomes important when looking at MAA to consider these results In the context of a much longer-term picture.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nLook, I say, what Mid-America has actually managed to do for its investors. Market cycle is largely irrelevant if you look at the very long term. The company has a 30+ year tradition of creating value in the Sunbelt region, and MAA also has an in-house team and operations for creating value in new developments and properties.\n\nThe company's top markets remain places like Atlanta, Dallas, and Tampa, each of which are growing at non-trivial rates with very solid market fundamentals, in terms of employment, salaries, age, and the like.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nHowever, the company's main challenge remains the outlook for the full year at this time. Not only is revenue and rent growth expected to remain below 1% for the year, the physical occupancy is also not expected to reach 96%, and both expense and real estate tax growth rates are expected to be between 4%- 5.6%, with a midpoint closer to 5% for each, and a property NOI growth of negative 1.3%.\n\nIn short, it's not set to be an overly impressive year for the company here - but 2025E and beyond, that's when some of the positive trends are set to materialize here which could and should improve things. We're talking about platform initiatives, the impacts of repositioning some projects, more redevelopment, some new M&As, some lease-ups, and continued upside from the geography here.\n\nIt also pays off here to remember the current migration trends within the US, which I have been following since COVID-19.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nPlenty to like here about this for MAA - and this outperformance for these areas is set to continue on a forward basis. The company's projects have been put to market, including things like some Atlanta projects, Phoenix, Denver, Raleigh, and others - with pre-purchases available in many, and others coming online in early 2025E at the latest.\n\nThe company also moves forward with internal redevelopments and renovations, with updated kitchens, appliances, and new flooring. None of these things are where I would expect massive bottom-line improvements, this is more the company \"keeping up\" with the competition.\n\nOverall, Mid-America manages some very attractive assets with plenty of value-adds, including fitness centers, co-working areas, spas, and relaxation areas. I've said it before and I will say it again - if I were to take the step to live part-time in the US, it would be in one of these areas, and it would likely be in a unit either from Camden or from Mid-America. While in some comparisons they come across as expensive, they also offer flexibility and value which I, being of the target demography and income, find appealing.\n\n1Q24 and the rest of 2024 therefore, is something I expect to continue to be relatively flat, or even negative - and I expect the company to trade or trend down a bit as well - but over the long term, expect the company to improve and move up - leading to positive RoR for shareholders that invest today.\n\nHow high?\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nMid-America Valuation - A 15% annualized upside is still possible here\n\nWhat I've said before is mostly still true - in that even if you decide to forecast the company at only a 19-20x P/E, MAA continues to show a compelling upside. At a 7-10-year average, a 20x P/AFFO is not illogical or exuberant, especially when you consider that this company \"hits\" its targets 100% of the time with a 10% margin of error. The company still does this as well, which leads me to forecast the company at a range of around 20-21x P/AFFO.\n\nThe results you could get from the investment as it stands now is looking as follows.\n\nF.A.S.T graphs Upside Mid-America(F.A.S.T graphs Upside Mid-America)\n\nIs this sort of return likely?\n\nWell, based on the company's extensive history of \"hitting its targets\", I would characterize this as a likely development. Even if the company turns sour and doesn't hit that note of 19-20x, and only stays at 17-19x, you're still generating solid returns well above that of a savings account or a CD (Paywalled Link to F.A.S.T Graphs). So based on this, I would say that this company, even if it turns a bit sour from here, represents a very solid investment.\n\nRemember, I'm often not looking for massive, quadruple-digit returns. Far too many investors focus on what they \"can get\", when investing, when they should be focusing on what they could actually lose if the company turned sour. While a portion of my portfolio, about 10-15%, is allocated to riskier plays, the vast majority is invested in companies that strictly generate income and a solid, annualized rate of return while minimizing overall risk.\n\nThis is what MAA is for me - a very solid investment with very high safety.\n\nAnalysts would concur with this. We're currently at a share price of $137, and if you recall, I have a PT of $139. I'm not switching my PT here, which means the company's upside is almost gone here. The 20 analysts that follow the company have a range starting at $124/share and going up to $154/share, with an average of $139, an increase of $2/share since the last time I wrote which means the average is exactly on my current PT as well (Paywalled TIKR.com Link).\n\nHowever, most analysts despite this price target, are currently at a \"HOLD\". Almost 15 of them out of 20 do not consider the company a \"BUY\" here.\n\nI say that it's not as attractive as it once was, and it does have downside potential - but it's still a solid multifamily potential.\n\nIf pressed to pick the two most attractive REITs to invest in today, my answer would be Realty Income (O) and Agree (ADC). But many investors, especially here, are already at capacity with these investments - as am I. So I would say that MAA represents a good alternative if you're looking to invest money at a good dividend rate and potential upside.\n\nMy thesis for the company is as follows for June 2024 and for the coming 7 months.\n\nThesis\n\nMid-America Apartment Communities is, in this analyst's view, a sector-leading REIT with a very solid portfolio of good exposure to some of the most attractive apartment real estate in the USA.\n\nThe company offers a compelling upside both based on valuation and the potential of growth and stability with above-average operating and safety metrics.\n\nI give the company a share price of $139/share, under which I believe the 15% annualized is intact, even as of June 2024. You're in for a poor year, as I see it, but beyond 2025E, that's when we'll see some real upside in MAA. I believe it could pay off to invest at this time.\n\nRemember, I'm all about:\n\nBuying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.\n\nIf the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1.\n\nIf the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows.\n\nI reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.\n\nHere are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).\n\nThis company is overall qualitative.\n\nThis company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.\n\nThis company pays a well-covered dividend.\n\nThis company is currently cheap.\n\nThis company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.\n\nI can't call MAA \"cheap\" here, but I can call it \"qualitative\", and I do - as well as a \"BUY\".",

        "title": "Cavco Industries: Uncertain Housing Market Due To High Rates And Low Inventory (NASDAQ:CVCO)",
        "body": "Marje\n\nSynopsis\n\nCavco Industries (NASDAQ:CVCO) designs and manufactures factory-built homes. Based on reported wholesale shipments, it is one of the largest manufacturers of manufactured homes in the US. For FY2024, CVCO\u2019s net revenue fell due to a decline in its factory-built housing segment, which reported lower sales volume and selling prices. Profitability margins also contracted slightly due to increasing SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue and contracting gross profit margins.\n\nIn 2023, the US manufactured housing industry's annual shipments decreased due to a rising interest rate environment. The current interest rate environment is looking uncertain as well due to persistent inflation. Therefore, this uncertainty is expected to create headwinds for CVCO in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, the US is facing housing affordability issues as a median-income household can no longer afford a median-priced home. This might potentially be beneficial for CVCO as it provides factory-built housing, which is considered one of the most affordable forms of unsubsidized home ownership. However, given CVCO\u2019s uncertain outlook and a lack of margin of safety in its current share price, I recommend a hold rating for now.\n\nHistorical Financial Analysis\n\nAuthor's Chart\n\nCVCO has been experiencing some fluctuations in terms of net revenue growth. In 2022, net revenue reported was approximately $1.627 billion. In 2023, net revenue increased to $2.142 billion. This growth was driven by both its factory-built housing and financial services segments. The factory-built housing segment reported year-over-year growth of 33%, while the financial services segment increased by 3.4%. The growth seen in the factory-built housing segment was attributed to higher home selling prices and sales volume. Additionally, the Solitaire Homes acquisition also contributed to this growth, contributing $28.3 million.\n\nHowever, in 2024, net revenue fell to $1.794 billion. The decline reported in 2024 was mainly due to a decrease in its factory-built housing segment revenue. For the year, this segment reported a year-over-year decrease of 17.1%. The decline in factory-built housing segment revenue was due to lower sales volume and selling prices. On a brighter note, its financial services segment revenue increased 6.7% year-over-year but was totally offset by the decline reported in its factory-built housing segment.\n\nAuthor's Chart\n\nMoving onto margins, 2024\u2019s figures showed modest contraction across all three of them. Its consolidated gross profit margin contracted from 25.90% to 23.79%. This contraction was driven by both its factory-built housing and financial service segments gross profit declines. For its factory-built housing segment, the gross profit decline was due to lower home sales prices and fewer units sold. Factory-built housing gross profit margin contracted by 2.1% to 23.2%. For its financial service segments, gross profit margin contracted 7.1% to 35.8%.\n\nRegarding SG&A as a percentage of net revenue, it increased to 13.82% from 2023\u2019s 12.06%. As a result of contracting gross profit margin and increasing SG&A as a percentage of net revenue, its income from operation margin contracted from 13.84% to 9.98%. Additionally, its net income margin contracted from 11.24% to 8.80%.\n\nRevenue Segment\n\nAuthor's Chart\n\nCVCO is one of the largest manufacturers of factory-built houses in the U.S., providing quality and affordable housing solutions, including HUD-Code homes, modular homes, multi-family/commercial building and vacation cabins. CVCO also offers home loan financing solutions and insurance policies. Homes sold can be further segregated into wholesale and retail. Wholesale homes are sold to independent distributors, builders, communities, and developers. Retails are sold directly to consumers by CVCO\u2019s retail stores. Wholesale prices typically consist of the cost of home and shipping from factory to site, while retail prices include additional retail markup.\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Analysis\n\nFor its most recent 4Q24 results, CVCO reported net revenue of approximately $420.18 million, down 11.8% from 4Q23\u2019s $476.38 million. For the quarter, financial services segment revenue increased 6.4% but was offset by the decrease in the factory-built housing segment. Factory-built housing segment revenue fell 12.6% year-over-year and was mainly attributed to lower sales volume. For the quarter, the number of factory-built homes sold fell 12% year-over-year. On the other hand, the net factory-built housing revenue per home sold remained robust, as the year-over-year decrease was a modest 0.7%.\n\nRegarding margins, CVCO\u2019s consolidated gross profit margin decreased 1.7% to 23.6% for the quarter. The contraction in consolidated gross profit margin was due to contractions in both its reportable segments\u2019 gross profit margins.\n\nFor the factory-built housing segment, gross profit fell because of the lower sales volume. Its gross profit margin contracted from 24.4% to 22.4% in 4Q24. In the financial services segment, although gross profit increased by 4.7% as a result of having more insurance policies in force and fewer weather-related events, gross profit margin contracted by 0.7%.\n\nFor the quarter, CVCO\u2019s income from operation margin contracted from 11.39% to 8.95%. This contraction was due to a lower gross profit margin, as discussed, and also a higher SG&A as a percentage of net revenue. In 4Q23, SG&A as a percentage of net revenue was 13.93%. In 2024, this percentage expanded to 14.62%. As a result, CVCO\u2019s net income margin contracted from 9.94% to 8.08%. Its diluted EPS fell from $5.39 to $4.03.\n\nThe Manufactured Housing Trend\n\nCensus Bureau Investor Relations\n\nFrom 2009 to 2022, the US manufactured housing industry's annual shipments have been consistently growing. In 2009, there were approximately 50,000 units, but by 2022, it had increased to 113,000 units. This represents a percentage change of approximately 126%.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the number of manufactured homes broke the 100,000 unit threshold for the first time since 2007. 2021 reported 106,000, while 2022 reported 113,000. The driver behind this growth in manufactured housing was due to pent-up demand, rising housing prices, and low interest rates. As a result, they drove higher interest and demand for manufactured housing.\n\nHowever, in 2023, it reported a decline to 89,000 units, which represents a drop of approximately 21%. For context, the average number of manufactured homes completed between 2018 and 2020 was approximately 95,200, which is higher than 2023\u2019s reported figures.\n\nFannie Mae\n\nThe main driver behind the decline in 2023 was due to a rising interest rate environment. According to Fannie Mae, the interest rate started to increase in March 2022 and continued into 2023. Looking at the chart, 2023\u2019s first-half total number of manufactured homes reported was only 44,000. Over the past six years, this is the lowest number of units completed for any half-year. This data shows that the rising interest rate environment is creating headwinds in the manufactured home industry as well. As stated, 2023\u2019s figure has fallen below the 100,000 unit threshold that was achieved in the past two years.\n\nCurrent Interest Rate Environment\n\nThe Fed\u2019s reluctance to ease monetary policy continues to stall the housing market, keeping homebuyers frustrated as they deal with persistently high housing costs. Despite inflation data having cooled to 2.7% in the past few months, the Fed would need more confidence that it would return to its 2% goal before they would start reducing the interest rate. Until this happens, mortgage rates are unlikely to cool significantly. Even though there have been certain improvements since the November mortgage rate plunge, it is still considerably high, averaging around 7%.\n\nDespite the higher mortgage rates, CVCO has been seeing an increase in quarter-to-quarter backlogs. Even though a stronger easing of the mortgage rate would have helped to facilitate this recovery, the growing backlog is showing that buyers are adjusting to the higher rates, which have led to improvements in orders.\n\nFRED\n\nOn June 12, 2024, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged, and they projected only one rate reduction for 2024. The reason behind keeping rates unchanged is to combat the current sticky inflation. Before this, the market expects more than one rate cut in 2024. However, due to persistent inflation, these rate-cut expectations are quickly dissipating.\n\nTherefore, looking ahead, if inflation were to remain elevated or sticky, I believe the interest rate will also remain unchanged, which will have an impact on the mortgage rate and CVCO's outlook. Given the current uncertain outlook on inflation and the direction of the interest rate, I anticipate these to create a slight headwind for CVCO in the short term. In the longer term, if inflation comes under control and the interest rate comes down, it will stimulate the housing market, which will benefit CVCO.\n\nUnaffordable Housing\n\nNBC News analysis of Census Bureau\n\nBased on the following chart, since August 2022, a median-income household can no longer afford a median-priced home in the US. As of April 2024, the gap has been widening, and the median list price has increased to approximately $439,337, while what a median-income household can afford has fallen to approximately $370,611.\n\nGiven the current affordability situation, this is where factory-built homes come into play. For context, CVCO is one of the largest producers of manufactured homes in the US. Factory-built homes have certain advantages over site-built homes, and one of them is their affordability advantage. Factory-built homes are considered one of the most affordable forms of unsubsidized home ownership. In addition, zoning regulations are starting to loosen in response to concerns about affordability.\n\nAccording to CVCO, the average retail price of a factory-built home is approximately $108,000, whereas a site-built home averages $365,000. At $108,000, it is well below what a median-income household can afford. Apart from the pricing advantage, CVCO also offers factory-built homes that are of high quality and innovative design. Examples include HUD-Code homes, modular home, park model, and multi-family/commercial. For context, CVCO is one of the largest U.S. HUD builders, bolstering 31 production lines.\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nRelative Valuation Model\n\nAuthor Relative Valuation\n\nIn my relative valuation model, I will be comparing CVCO against its peers in terms of growth outlook and profitability margins. For growth outlook comparison, I will be comparing in terms of forward revenue growth rate, as it is a forward-looking metric. For profitability margins, I will be comparing their EBITDA margin TTM and net income margin TTM. These comparisons will give us an idea of the performance and strength of their core business activities. For context, CVCO operates in the homebuilding industry.\n\nIn terms of growth outlook, CVCO underperformed its peers, as it reported a forward revenue growth rate of -1.74% while its peers\u2019 median is -1.28%. Although peers\u2019 median is better, it is in negative territory as well. When compared individually, CVCO is not the one with the worst outlook, as LEGH reported -8.25%. SKY is also reporting a negative forward revenue growth rate of -1.28%. Overall, the industry\u2019s outlook is not looking great.\n\nIn terms of profitability margins, CVCO underperformed in both metrics. Firstly, its EBITDA margin TTM of 10.91% is lower than peers\u2019 median of 20.40%. Secondly, its net income margin TTM of 8.79% is also lower than peers\u2019 median of 16.67%.\n\nCurrently, CVCO has a forward P/E ratio of 17.29x, which is higher than peers\u2019 median of 15.34x. Given CVCO's underperformance in both growth outlook and profitability margins, I argue that its P/E should not be trading above its peers\u2019 median. Therefore, I will be adjusting my 2026 target P/E for CVCO downward to 15x. By having a lower P/E than its peers, it better reflects CVCO\u2019s underperformance against them.\n\nFor 2026, the market revenue estimate for CVCO is approximately $2.03 billion, while EPS is $22.80 per share. According to management in CVCO's most recent 10K, the company will keep focusing on maximising efficiencies by achieving a balance between workforce size and production levels against the demand for its product offerings. This, in turn, will lead to margin improvements moving forward. Therefore, given CVCO\u2019s commitment to maximising efficiencies as well as my forward-looking analysis as discussed, they justify the market\u2019s estimates. By applying my adjusted target P/E to CVCO\u2019s 2026 EPS, my 2026 target price for CVCO is $342.\n\nRisk and Conclusion\n\nAs discussed, interest rates have an impact on the housing market. When the Fed raises its benchmark rate, it increases the cost of owning a new home. This in turn reduces housing demand as the number of buyers decreases. If inflation were to start cooling, it might prompt the Fed to begin their rate-cut measures. Lower interest rates will lead to lower mortgage rates, which in turn will drive demand for new homes as the number of potential buyers who can afford or are willing to buy a new home increases. In such a scenario, it might bolster CVCO\u2019s growth outlook, leading to share price appreciation.\n\nCVCO faced modest headwinds in FY2024 caused by the interest rate environment, which resulted in its net revenue decline. The decline was driven by the decrease in the factory-built housing segment, which reported lower sales volume and selling prices. In addition, profitability margins also contracted slightly.\n\nIn 2023, the rising interest rate environment caused US manufactured housing industry annual shipments to fall. Currently, the interest rate environment is looking uncertain due to sticky inflation. Additionally, the US is facing housing affordability issues, and this might be beneficial for CVCO as it provides factory-built housing. Given CVCO\u2019s uncertain outlook as well as a lack of margin of safety in its current share price, I am recommending a hold rating.",

        "title": "Broadcom: An Essential Company For AI Investors (NASDAQ:AVGO)",
        "body": "G0d4ather\n\nMy thesis\n\nBroadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) AI-related revenue is soaring and is expected to represent more than a third of the total by the end of FY2024. This is a strong indicator of the company having strong AI exposure, and the market already knows it as the stock price almost tripled since January 2023. The company's intrinsic value is higher than the current market capitalization by 9%, and this potential upside might be unattractive for some investors. However, the DCF model is built on conservative assumptions and does not price in decrease in interest rates soon.\n\nBroadcom's surge in AI revenues is not a coincidence or a one-off event. The company's revenue is extremely diversified with various offerings, it has an extremely wide intellectual property base, and continues investing billions in developing new technologies. Insanely high profitability metrics underscore AVGO's extensive pricing power backed by the technological strength of its products. The management has ambitions to make AVGO one of the major AI beneficiaries, and the pace of rolling out new products and features proves that the team is working hard. Recent reports suggest that we are still far from the bubble in AI, meaning that AVGO is still a very attractive opportunity deserving a Strong Buy rating.\n\nAVGO stock analysis\n\nAVGO is among Nasdaq 100 top-ten best performing stocks in the first half of 2024. As a semiconductor stock, AVGO has been one of the main darlings of the AI-driven rally which started since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBroadcom is an essential company amid the expansion of AI solutions because of the company's focus on complex semiconductor products that are vital for building systems that enable high-performance computing. But Broadcom's products are not only aimed for data centers, but also for a broad range of other applications like broadband access, telecom equipment, smartphones, factory automation. The company does not only sell hardware but has been expanding into software as well in recent years. Other companies in the below table are closer competitors, but none of them demonstrate such a massive free cash flow (FCF) margin.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nFor a non-IT person like me, it is difficult to assess the technical characteristics and advantages of Broadcom's semiconductor products, but accounting records sometimes speak quite loudly. Broadcom's profitability screams about the company's immense pricing power. Several profitability ratios of AVGO are comparable to Nvidia (NVDA), the major AI star of recent years. AVGO and NVDA are not directly competing as products of these companies mostly complement each other rather than overlapping.\n\nAVGO's Investors Meeting\n\nBroadcom's AI revenue is soaring and is expected to represent 35% of the total by the end of FY2024, compared to below 5% in FY2021. A 35% forecast is ten percentage points higher than the management's previous guidance, meaning that the demand is soaring. Broadcom's success in AI is not surprising given the accelerating global AI spending and Broadcom's crucial role in this trend. While CPUs and GPUs are the brains of data centers, in the below picture it is shown that Broadcom's products are vital in connecting these \"brains\".\n\nAVGO's Investors Meeting\n\nBroadcom's positioning as a cornerstone of AI servers for data centers is likely very strong because the company heavily invests in developing new products, and the below timeline of its Tomahawk networking offering speaks volumes. Since the launch of the product in 2010, the company's relentless commitment to innovate helped in increasing its bandwidth by 80 times while reducing energy consumption by 90%.\n\nAVGO's Investors Meeting\n\nThe company is unlikely to stop innovating as it had 910 pending U.S. patents pending as of the end of the last fiscal year, in addition to 15,400 patents which were already in the company's intellectual property portfolio. According to the 10-K, with all key patents expiring closer to 2042.\n\nWith such a crucial meaning for AI servers and commitment to maintain technological excellence, AVGO is likely to benefit from massive investments in data centers from the largest U.S. tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Over the last six months, all these giants announced plans to invest tens of billions in data centers across the world. This aggressive spending on data centers is unlikely to end soon because these companies have accumulated massive cash reserves since the Pandemic. In the below table, I summarized cash balances of these giants as of the end of FQ1. The total cash balance of these companies is $331 billion, meaning there are massive reserves to invest in the AI infrastructure.\n\nDT Invest\n\nBroadcom's future growth potential is not only about AI servers and data centers. There is another potentially strong driver of long-term growth, which are semiconductor products for the Internet-of-Things industry (IoT). It is expected to become a $1.5 trillion market by 2031, showing a 19.4% CAGR. To understand how huge the IoT industry is expected to be, statista.com suggests that the global smartphones market totaled $0.5 trillion in 2023. According to Broadcom's Director of Product Marketing, the company's chips have strong potential to be used across different IoT areas and verticals.\n\nIntrinsic value calculation\n\nI value growth stocks using the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. A central variable in a DCF model is its discount rate, which is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). AVGO's WACC is 10.7%, based on the below working.\n\nDT Invest\n\nI consider consensus revenue estimates as a reliable source for my DCF's revenue assumptions for years 1-2. Due to its scale and popularity, the company's financial metrics forecasts are extensively covered by Wall Street analysts for the next three years, which adds credibility to my revenue growth assumptions. For years 3-5 I implement a steady 100 basis points per year CAGR decrease. The year 1 free cash flow margin is as usual the levered TTM level of 47.45%. AVGO's FCF margin is very high and projecting further improvements might be too optimistic. Therefore, the FCF margin assumption will be constant for all five years. An aggressive 5% perpetual growth rate is used due to AVGO's robust AI exposure and historical revenue growth rates.\n\nA 5% perpetual growth rate might be questionable for AVGO bears. I think that since the perpetual growth rate significantly impacts the total intrinsic value, I have to spend some time on explaining my reasoning. I want to prove that a 5% rate is reasonable by looking both forward and backwards. According to stockanalysis.com, Broadcom's revenue was $1.4 billion in 2006 and grew to $35.8 billion by 2023. It means that the average compound annual revenue growth rate was 21% over the last seventeen years.\n\nmarket.us\n\nFrom the forward-looking perspective, a 5% perpetual growth rate also looks justified. AVGO's offerings are central for AI servers, as was shown in my analysis. According to market.us, the global AI server market will become a $430 billion industry by 2033. The projected industry's CAGR is 30.3%, and AVGO's exposure to this industry is rapidly expanding. Based on AVGO's historical revenue growth and potential in AI servers, I think that a 5% perpetual growth rate might be even pessimistic.\n\nBroadcom's intrinsic value is almost $800 billion. A 9% discount for AVGO looks like a good deal, especially considering conservative revenue growth assumptions used in my DCF. Furthermore, as interest rates are expected to start declining soon, discount rates will soften as well.\n\nDT Invest\n\nWhat can go wrong with my thesis?\n\nA close to 50% FCF margin is extremely high, and potential future competition might diminish AVGO's high profitability. There is no guarantee that AVGO will be able to sustain this FCF levels over the next decade or even the next five years. The FCF margin shrinkage might negatively affect the company's intrinsic value.\n\nBeing a technological company also means that there are significant risks of the company's products and services becoming obsolete and non-competitive in case AVGO fails to drive innovation. The competition for talented engineers is extremely high as there are many other companies larger than AVGO (for example the four giants mentioned above that have total cash of $330 billion) that are highly likely to offer better compensation.\n\nBroadcom's goodwill more than doubled compared to last year after the VMware acquisition. As of the last report, goodwill amounted to $98 billion. In case the VMware investment does not pay off, AVGO will be recognizing a multi-billion impairment charge. This will significantly negatively affect the company's EPS, and ultimately the valuation.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are many more reasons to be bullish than bearish when we speak about Broadcom. The management's determination to make AVGO an essential part of the AI revolution is strong, and stellar past performance increases chances of succeeding again.",
        "summary": "This is a strong indicator of the company having strong AI exposure, and the market already knows it as the stock price almost tripled since January 2023.\nAVGO's Investors MeetingBroadcom's AI revenue is soaring and is expected to represent 35% of the total by the end of FY2024, compared to below 5% in FY2021.\nBroadcom's success in AI is not surprising given the accelerating global AI spending and Broadcom's crucial role in this trend.\nAn aggressive 5% perpetual growth rate is used due to AVGO's robust AI exposure and historical revenue growth rates.\nIt means that the average compound annual revenue growth rate was 21% over the last seventeen years.",

        "title": "FedEx Q4: Turnaround Taking Hold (NYSE:FDX)",
        "body": "Wirestock/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nI believe the ongoing struggles FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has faced are mainly centered around their competitive operating efficiency, as exemplified by the U.S. Postal Service's decision to expand United Parcel Service (UPS) as their primary air cargo provider in April 2024.\n\nFor years, FedEx has faced challenges in sustaining their operations, especially in securing mutually beneficial terms to extend their contract with USPS. USPS was FedEx Express\u2019s largest customer, paying them roughly $1.7 billion in the fiscal year of 2023. This was a big loss to FedEx. However, I think the turnaround is starting to take shape.\n\nFedEx has begun introducing cost-cutting measures under their DRIVE savings program, which contributed to a 14% increase in net income for the fiscal Q3 ending February 2024. So far, these cost cutting measures have proven to be successful in not only reducing costs but also making them more lean and efficient, as revenue has increased from $21.7 billion last quarter to $22.1 billion beating expectations by $41.14 million.\n\nAssuming this turnaround has legs, I think the stock has upside. With this, I am a strong buy on shares. If FedEx can continue to execute their cost-cutting strategies effectively and stabilize their revenue streams, the current valuation presents a compelling entry point for investors looking for potential upside in a market where FedEx has historically been undervalued relative to their performance improvements\u200b.\n\nBackground\u200b\u200b\n\nFedEx has faced significant operational inefficiencies that have contributed to their lagging performance compared to competitors like UPS. These inefficiencies stem from various structural and strategic challenges, such as the underperformance of FedEx's Express segment. For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024, the Express unit's operating margin stood at a meager 1.9%, lower than the 20% margin achieved by the Freight unit and the 13% margin of the Ground segment\u200b\u200b.\n\nAnother factor is the declining revenue across key segments. For the previous fiscal Q3 of 2024, the company reported a 2% year-over-year decline in total revenue, dropping from $22.2 billion to $21.7 billion\u200b\u200b. The Express segment alone saw a 2% decrease in revenue due to lower volumes and fewer fees for fuel and surcharges. However, as I mentioned above, revenue has begun to turn around for FedEx in this most recent quarter.\n\nThe loss of their contract with the USPS to UPS\u200b\u200b, which accounted for roughly $1.7 billion in revenue, reflects their operational inefficiencies and inability to sustain their customer relations. USPS needed an option to lower their costs and a longer reach with more areas where FedEx has evidently been underperforming\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The new contract with UPS is described as \"mutually beneficial\" and complements their \"unique, reliable and efficient integrated network,\" according to UPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9\u200b\u200b.\n\nFedEx, for their part, announced in a post:\n\nThe elimination of structural costs currently in place to support postal service volume will be addressed and, in conjunction with our DRIVE efforts, FedEx profitability will improve in FY25 and beyond.\n\nEarnings Recap\n\nFedEx's recent earnings report has delivered results that exceeded market expectations, leading to a significant boost in their stock price. FedEx reported a non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.41, which beat analyst estimates by $0.04. The company also boasted a revenue of $22.1 billion, which surpassed expectations by $40 million\u200b\u200b. Importantly, this performance marks a year-over-year revenue increase of 0.9%.\n\nThe company's operating income for 4Q was $1.87 billion on an adjusted basis, beating the consensus estimate of $1.82 billion. Not only did FedEx beat expectations but this is also an increase from $1.77 billion a year ago. This improvement in operating income was driven by decreased structural costs from FedEx's DRIVE initiatives, increased yield, and reduced self-insurance costs\u200b\u200b. The Ground segment, in particular, showed better performance because of growth in commercial volume and effective cost management.\n\nFedEx also announced plans to repurchase $2.5 billion of their common stock, including $1.0 billion during the first fiscal quarter. They also approved an increase in the annual dividend rate by 10% to $5.52 per share\u200b\u200b. Since reporting earnings on June 25th, FedEx shares have increased by nearly 17%.\n\nAll of this sounds good. I believe this shows a company pulling off a multi-prong turnaround in both revenue, operating income, and delivering more capital back to shareholders. It appears to be a triple win.\n\nChief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, is optimistic for the coming year. During the company\u2019s recent earnings call, she stated:\n\nLooking ahead, in fiscal year 2025, we expect the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year. Currently, we expect US domestic parcel and LTL volumes to continue to improve with the year-over-year increase growing as the year progresses. International air cargo demand from Asia accelerated in early May and is stronger versus previous expectations. We expect year-over-year growth to be driven by e-commerce and low inventory levels. Shippers are facing tightened capacity both in air and sea freight services. Red Sea disruptions have further exacerbated shipper challenges from Asia to Europe. These conditions should bring strength to the overall air freight yields from Asia. -Q4 Call.\n\nWhile FedEx has been struggling, their future looks much better.\n\nValuation\n\nOver the past three months, FedEx has recorded only 4 upward EPS revisions and 19 downward revenue revisions, which indicate market analysts' pretty bearish outlook for the company\u2019s earnings power\u200b\u200b. This conservative position has resulted in forward estimates that may understate the company's performance.\n\nWith these conservative revisions, FedEx's valuation metrics suggest the stock is undervalued relative to their sector. The company\u2019s forward Non-GAAP P/E ratio stands at 14.44, compared to the sector median of 18.65, representing a -22.60% discount\u200b\u200b. This discrepancy indicates that even with muted EPS estimates, there is still room for growth.\n\nThe company's EPS growth rate (FWD) is projected to be 17.42%\u200b\u200b, and is expected to compound at 13.90% over the next 3-5 year CAGR horizon. I like this a lot (on top of the share buybacks the company is committing to).\n\nIf FedEx's valuation were to converge with the sector median forward P/E, this would imply a significant upside potential. Given the current forward P/E of 14.44 and the sector median of 18.65, the stock could see an upside of approximately 29.16% if revalued at the sector median\u200b\u200b. The company\u2019s forward EPS growth on both the short and medium term horizons is projected to beat the sector median. This is after analysts downgraded estimates for more conservative growth. I think this is a great setup.\n\nRisks\n\nEconomic indicators point to decreased growth in the demand for U.S. freight, further exacerbating the industry's challenges. Factors such as a capacity glut in U.S. highways, driven by an increase in registered Class 8 vehicles from 1.47 million in February 2020 to 1.7 million by April 2023, have diluted the impact of any gains in freight demand. This oversupply has softened the market and weakened freight rates, creating a tough environment for logistics companies\u200b\u200b including FedEx.\n\nThe National Truckload Index, which measures average national truckload spot rates, fell to $1.49 per mile last year, while operating costs for trucking companies had risen by over 30 cents per mile, not including fuel costs\u200b\u200b (as of June 24th, spot rates have gone up to $2.32 for a seven-day average).\n\nFedEx has not been immune to these industry-wide issues, which have weighed heavily on their earlier financial results. The company's freight segment has struggled to maintain profitability amid declining volumes and lower rates. The broader economic context, marked by slow manufacturing growth and fluctuating retail sales, has also played a role in the sluggish performance of the freight market\u200b\u200b. The Transportation Services Index (TSI) data reflects this, showing that freight transportation services have not regained their pre-recession growth rates and continue to lag behind the overall economy's growth\u200b\u200b.\n\nFedEx has also been affected by the growing dominance of Amazon in the delivery market, whose expansion in logistics has increased competition and shifted significant volumes away from traditional carriers like FedEx. In 2023, Amazon was estimated to have delivered 5.9 billion packages, surpassing both UPS and FedEx\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThere are also other factors that can hinder any prospect for the company\u2019s performance.\n\nIn 2023, there were wage disparity and labor issues within FedEx Ground. Former contractors have cited a 30% to 40% turnover among drivers in the past 18 months. This problem was exacerbated by the wage differences compared to UPS drivers, who, under a new Teamsters union contract, could earn higher wages and benefits. This made it challenging for FedEx to attract and retain qualified drivers.\n\nHowever, these risks can be managed, in my opinion.\n\nAs the logistics industry consolidates, FedEx stands to benefit by streamlining their operations and leveraging their expansive network more effectively. This phase is expected to reduce competitive fragmentation, and allow FedEx to capitalize on their scale and scope. In recent years, FedEx has launched several initiatives to enhance their operational efficiency and reduce costs. For instance, the expansion of the Mojix inventory tracking platform enables FedEx to reduce aircraft downtime by swiftly locating and delivering necessary parts for repairs, thereby maintaining operational agility and minimizing costs\u200b\u200b.\n\nFedEx has also been focusing on their advanced data capabilities to drive efficiency and innovation. The establishment of the FedEx Innovation Lab in 2023 aims to leverage advanced technology and data-driven insights and build smart logistics solutions and digital capabilities.\n\nFedEx Dataworks, another project, combines the company's digital and physical networks to create a scalable platform of interconnected data, insights, and information. This platform captures real-time data on every package, enhancing supply chain visibility and predictability by integrating advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning.\n\nThese are the types of things only logistics providers at scale can do, which means they are highly competitive not only against other large logistics providers, but also against small ones as well. It's why I am optimistic the company can thrive in this environment. It's why I feel optimistic that a turnaround has begun.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFedEx has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including operational inefficiencies, a competitive freight market, and the growing dominance of Amazon in the delivery sector. However, the company has taken steps to address these issues for a potential turnaround. The introduction of the DRIVE cost-cutting initiative aims to save $4 billion by 2025 $6 billion by 2027. FedEx has also invested in advanced technology and data analytics to drive efficiency and innovation\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe recent earnings report reflects these efforts starting to bear fruit\u200b\u200b. The favorable guidance for fiscal 2025, combined with plans for significant stock repurchases and dividend increases, further boosts my confidence\u200b\u200b. Despite previous downward revisions, the company\u2019s forward P/E ratio remains below the sector median, which suggests substantial upside potential as turnaround (I believe) occurs. With this, I place FedEx as a strong buy.",

        "title": "Northwest Natural: Good Dividend, But That Is All (NYSE:NWN)",
        "body": "strickke\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding Company (NYSE:NWN) is a utility company that primarily provides natural gas services to customers in rural Washington and Oregon. The company also provides water utility services in Idaho, Arizona, and Texas:\n\nNorthwest Natural\n\nAs is the case with many utility companies that do not provide electricity services, Northwest Natural Holding is frequently overlooked by the market. After all, many investors believe that electric utilities have much greater growth potential. Indeed, there could be a case for that if generative artificial intelligence ever takes off on the scale that some analysts project. Scientific American recently stated that artificial intelligence alone could use more electricity than some countries by 2027. However, we should not completely ignore natural gas and water utilities like Northwest Natural Holding. This is especially true in northern states because natural gas is much more efficient at heating or cooking than electricity. This results in it being cheaper to use for these purposes. Therefore, it will always be the energy of choice for residential and business customers in those areas. In most cases, there is only one supplier of natural gas. Thus, people migrating to those areas will almost certainly become customers of the company and drive its forward growth.\n\nAs regular readers can likely remember, we previously discussed Northwest Natural Holding in late December 2023. The equity market since that time has generally been pretty strong, and natural gas prices have increased. However, the utility sector as a whole has been weak due partly to the fact that utility companies are frequently treated as bond proxies by the market. As a result, we might not expect Northwest Natural to have delivered a strong performance since that time. This is an assumption that was proven correct, as shares of the company are down 7.67% since my previous article was published:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWe can see that the company underperformed both the S&P 500 Index (SP500) and the U.S. Utilities ETF (IDU) by quite a lot. This is almost certainly going to reduce the appeal of this company among potential investors. However, the share price decline has had the positive effect of boosting the company's dividend yield. Northwest Natural Holding boasts a 5.40% dividend yield right now, which makes it one of the few companies (in any sector) that currently has a higher dividend yield than an ordinary money market fund. As the common stock has a much higher potential to deliver capital gains than any money market fund, that prospect may entice some investors whose primary goals revolve around the generation of income.\n\nInvestors in this company did better over the period than the price performance alone would suggest. Northwest Natural Holding's high yield offset some, but not all, of the share price decline, and investors in the company ultimately only lost 5.30% when the dividend is taken into consideration:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThis is still nothing to write home about, though, as the company did hand its investors a loss during a six-month period that was generally pretty good for most other things in the market. While some utility investors might be willing to accept a certain amount of underperformance in exchange for a high yield, it is still doubtful that they would be willing to accept a loss over the course of half a year.\n\nAs six months have passed since we last discussed this company, let us revisit it and our general thesis surrounding it. The important things that we want to see are whether or not it still makes sense to be invested in this company, how its financial situation has been evolving, and whether or not the share price dip could present a possible opportunity.\n\nAbout Northwest Natural Holding Company\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, Northwest Natural Holding is a utility holding company that provides natural gas services to customers in Oregon and Washington state along with water service to customers in the Pacific Northwest, Texas, and Arizona. According to the company's website:\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding Company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and has been doing business for over 165 years in the Pacific Northwest. It owns NW Natural Gas Company, NW Natural Renewables Holdings, NW Natural Water Company, and other business interests. We have a longstanding commitment to safety, environmental stewardship and the energy transition, and taking care of our employees and communities. NW Natural is a local distribution company that currently provides natural gas service to approximately 2.0 million people in more than 140 communities through 800,000 meters in Oregon and Southwest Washington with one of the most modern pipeline systems in the nation. NW Natural consistently leads the industry with high J.D. Power & Associates customer satisfaction scores. NW Natural owns and operates 21 Bcf of underground gas storage capacity in Oregon. NW Natural Water provides water distribution and wastewater services throughout the Pacific Northwest, Texas and Arizona. NW Natural Water currently serves approximately 180,000 people through about 74,000 connections and provides operation and maintenance services to an additional 20,000 connections.\n\nWe can immediately see that the natural gas utility company is far larger than any of the company's other operations, at least in customer count. It is also much larger in terms of revenue, as 95% of the company's full-year 2023 operating revenue came from that single business segment:\n\nNorthwest Natural\n\nThis did not change much in the first quarter of 2024. The company's first-quarter earnings press release states that the natural gas utility alone accounted for $417.864 million in revenue against a consolidated total of $433.470 million. That means that the company's natural gas utility alone accounted for 96.40% of its first-quarter revenue. Thus, we can basically treat the company much as a pure-play natural gas utility, as the other segments do not have much impact on the company's overall performance.\n\nDue to its natural gas focus, the company's financial performance will probably be weaker over the next two or three quarters than we saw in the first quarter of 2024. This is in line with historical patterns, as we can see here:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThis chart shows the company's consolidated quarterly revenue for every quarter going back to the second half of 2021. As we can see, the company's first-quarter revenue during any given year tends to be substantially better than it is during the second or third quarter. In most cases, the fourth-quarter revenue is weaker than the first-quarter numbers, but it is not nearly as low as what the company sees during the summer months. This simply comes from the fact that natural gas consumption decreases when it is hot out and people are not running the furnaces in their homes.\n\nBusinesses, in contrast, will frequently use natural gas throughout the year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration states:\n\nIndustry uses natural gas for many purposes, including as a feedstock (raw material) to make products and generate electricity. \u2026 Natural gas is one of the primary sources of energy in U.S. commercial buildings. Some consumers in the commercial sector also use natural gas as a fuel to generate electricity and in combined heat and power systems.\n\nThe takeaway here is that businesses do not use natural gas solely for heating, so they will continue to consume some throughout the year. However, they still do not use as much during the second and third quarters as they consume during the winter months due to the lower need for space heating. This is nice because it does allow Northwest Natural Holding to generate some revenue during the summer months. The majority of the company's active utility accounts are residential, though:\n\nNorthwest Natural\n\nResidential customers are highly unlikely to have heavy natural gas consumption during the summer months. There are certainly some households that use natural gas stoves and water heaters, but that is pretty much all of the consumption that residential households will have during the summer months. Thus, the high proportion of residential households in the company's business mix does mean that its revenue will fluctuate somewhat more than a natural gas supplier that is very business or industrial-heavy.\n\nWith that said, there are a few advantages to the majority of the company's natural gas profits coming from the residential sector. One major one is that it is not especially hurt by the trend towards remote work. After all, this trend results in less natural gas consumption by office buildings and other commercial customers. If these buildings are empty during the day, it is only necessary to keep the heat high enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. That is a much lower level than is needed for the comfort of most humans. In contrast, if people are at home all day working, they might be inclined to keep their homes heated to a higher temperature than they would if they were away all day in the office. Thus, remote work results in a situation where commercial consumption of natural gas declines but residential consumption of natural gas increases. This appears to benefit Northwest Natural Holding given its customer mix.\n\nIn my previous article on Northwest Natural Holding, I pointed out that the Pacific Northwest could experience a warmer-than-normal winter in 2024 and that would negatively affect the company. From the previous article:\n\nThe biggest risk here is that an unusually warm winter could reduce the need for heating compared to more normal conditions. As Northwest Natural Holding's cash flows do depend on the amount of natural gas that its customers consume, warm weather that results in lower consumption of natural gas would have an adverse effect. This was the situation that we saw last year as many utilities specifically stated the warm weather as a reason for poor performance. \u2026 This could suggest that the Pacific Northwest may be warmer than normal this winter, especially with the warmer-than-normal Pacific Ocean. That naturally could cause Northwest Natural Holding's financial performance over the twelve months to be adversely affected by low natural gas demand. This might explain why the stock price has been underperforming the broader utility sector.\n\nIt turns out that my prediction was correct. The company specifically pointed out that warmer-than-normal winter temperatures had a negative impact on its first-quarter performance (bold text):\n\nNatural gas distribution segment net income decreased $6.2 million (or $0.28 per share) reflecting higher operating expenses. Margin increased $0.5 million primarily due to the amortization of deferrals and customer growth which among other miscellaneous items contributed $5.5 million. Partially offsetting these items was a $3.5 million reduction in margin due to warmer comparative weather and the effects of customers not covered by the weather normalization mechanism. Weather was 9% warmer than average in the first quarter of 2024, compared with 5% colder than average weather in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThus, if it was not for the weather, the company's revenue would have come in somewhat stronger than what the company actually experienced during the most recent quarter. Fortunately, that may be a one-time problem, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently predicts that the upcoming winter will be colder than average in the Pacific Northwest area where Northwest Natural Holding Company operates. Granted, it is difficult to make weather forecasts six to nine months out, but the fact that this is being driven by ocean temperatures does give the forecast a certain amount of credibility. If this prediction proves to be correct, Northwest Natural Holdings should have a bit of a revenue boost later on this year and into early next year. That does provide a bit of a tailwind for the stock price going forward.\n\nFinancial Considerations\n\nAs I stated in the previous article on Northwest Natural Holding Company:\n\nIt is always important that we investigate the way that a company finances its operations before making an investment in it. This is because debt is a riskier way to finance a company than equity because debt must be repaid at maturity. This is usually accomplished by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay the existing debt since very few companies have sufficient cash to completely pay off their debt as it matures. That process can cause a company's interest expense to increase following the rollover, depending on the conditions in the market.\n\nIn the previous article, we saw that Northwest Natural's interest expenses have been increasing over the past several quarters due to rising interest rates. This appears to have moderated a bit in recent quarters though, as shown here:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWe can certainly see a very steep increase from the first quarter of 2022 until the final quarter of last year. The company's interest expenses almost doubled over that period. However, the first quarter of 2024 actually saw a $2.3 million decline in total interest expenses and the trend over the past year has been stabilizing. Overall, it appears that the growth in the company's interest expenses has moderated to the point where it is pretty reliably paying $19 million to $21 million in interest per quarter. That is still a very substantial increase over the level that it was paying coming out of the pandemic, but it is no longer exhibiting rapid growth in interest expenses, either. While this will serve as a drag on the company's net income that it did not have a few years ago, it seems that it is more predictable now, which allows for better forward earnings projections.\n\nOne reason for this is that the company's borrowing activity appears to have decreased. We can see this by looking at the company's total and net debt at the end of the past several quarters:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nNote how the company's debt went up from $1.396.8 billion in the third quarter of 2021 to $1.5585 billion at the end of the same quarter in the following year. The company's debt then increased another roughly $207.1 million over the next year. However, it has actually declined a bit over the past six months. This is exactly what the Federal Reserve was attempting to accomplish by raising interest rates in 2022 and 2023. Basically, it was trying to get companies to slow down their borrowing because it is getting ever more expensive to borrow.\n\nIt is uncertain whether or not the company will actually be able to continue to hold back on its debt issuance that we have seen over the past six months. It is planning $415 million in capital expenditures in 2024, which is a higher than historical level:\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding\n\nThe company will have to finance this spending somehow, and that probably means that it will need to issue more debt at some point. The company only has $182.2 million in cash and accounts receivable, so it is obviously not going to fund these expenditures internally. The company did not state in its earnings report how it intends to fund this increase in capital expenditures, but a slide from its June 2024 investor presentation suggests that tapping existing lines of credit is one option that is being considered:\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding\n\nThus, we might see the company's interest expenses begin to climb again during the summer months as it undertakes utility work from these substantial capital expenditures.\n\nIn my previous article on Northwest Natural Holding Company, I stated:\n\nOne metric that we can use to evaluate the company's financial structure is the net debt-to-equity ratio. This ratio tells us the degree to which the company is depending on debt to finance its operations as opposed to its own funds. If this ratio is significantly higher than its peers, then it could be a sign that it is more reliant on debt than may be prudent. That would represent a risk that we should consider before investing in a company.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Northwest Natural Holding Company has a net debt of $1.6770 billion against shareholders' equity of $1.3434 billion. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.25 right now, which is actually a bit better than the 1.32 that it had the last time that we discussed it. This is nice to see, especially in today's monetary environment, where money actually costs something. Here is how Northwest Natural Holding Company compares to its peers:\n\nCompany Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio Northwest Natural Holding Company 1.25 New Jersey Resources (NJR) 1.48 NiSource Inc. (NI) 1.31 Atmos Energy (ATO) 0.60 Southwest Gas Holdings (SWX) 1.45 Spire Inc. (SR) 1.32 Click to enlarge\n\nWith the notable exception of Atmos Energy, Northwest Natural Holding Company has a lower proportion of debt financing its operations than any of its natural gas utility peers. This is a good sign, as it strongly suggests that the company is not overly reliant on debt to finance its operations. As such, we probably do not need to worry too much about its debt load right now. This company is not excessively leveraged.\n\nDividend Analysis\n\nAs I stated previously:\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why investors purchase utilities like Northwest Natural Holding is that they tend to have higher dividend yields than stocks in many other sectors. This is due to their relatively low growth rates. The low growth rate has induced the company to pay out a significant portion of its profits to the shareholders in order to provide a return to investors, and the low growth rate has prompted the market to assign lower multiples to the company than we might find in some other sectors. Thus, the dividend is a fairly high percentage of the company's stock price.\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding currently boasts a 5.40% dividend yield, which is far above the 1.33% current yield of the S&P 500 Index. The iShares U.S. Utilities ETF has a twelve-month trailing distribution yield of 2.47%, so Northwest Natural Holding beats the aggregate utility sector by quite a lot as well.\n\nThe company's yield is a lot higher than it was the last time that we discussed the company, which is entirely due to its poor share price performance. The company kept its quarterly dividend flat at $0.48750 per share, which is the same level that it has had since the third quarter of last year:\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThis company has been far less aggressive about raising its distribution than many other utilities, so that could be a problem for many investors. After all, we want our incomes to be rising in the face of today's high inflation.\n\nIt appears as though Northwest Natural Holding Company is having no difficulty maintaining its dividend. For the trailing twelve-month period, the company reported an operating cash flow of $228.1 million but it only paid out $68.6 million in dividends. Thus, it generated more than enough cash to cover its dividend and still has money left over for other purposes. We should not need to worry about the company's ability to maintain its payments.\n\nValuation\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.87. Here is how that compares to the company's peers:\n\nCompany Forward P/E Ratio Northwest Natural Holding Company 15.87 New Jersey Resources 14.54 NiSource Inc. 16.85 Atmos Energy 17.36 Southwest Gas Holdings 20.88 Spire Inc. 14.05 Click to enlarge\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding appears to have a reasonable valuation relative to its peers. There does not appear to be any real opportunity to pick up an undervalued company here, especially when we consider that Northwest Natural's earnings may be under some pressure this year. The company reduced its earnings guidance in the first quarter conference call, and pointed out that a significant proportion of its capital spending this year will be on rapidly depreciating assets. This will cause the company's depreciation expenses to rise and put downward pressure on its net income over the coming few quarters.\n\nA few of the company's peers, meanwhile, are expecting to experience earnings growth over the same period. That explains the higher ratios that some peer companies have compared to Northwest Natural Holding.\n\nWith that said, the increase in depreciation expenses should not adversely impact the company's operating cash flow. However, utility stocks tend to trade on earnings rather than cash flow.\n\nOverall, the company looks fairly valued at best.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Northwest Natural Holding is a very high-yielding natural gas utility that is frequently overlooked by the market. The company offers a very attractive yield for income investors that came about because of its very poor performance relative to the market and sector average over the past several months. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any real near-term catalyst for the stock price, and the company looks fairly valued. It may not be a horrible play if all you are after is the high yield, but the stock price is likely to struggle for at least the next six months.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "ICF: The Blue Chips Of REITs",
        "body": "Justin Paget\n\nI'm fairly positive on REITs as I've written about before given that we are entering an interest rate cutting cycle. REITs generally have underperformed for many years now, and I believe a lot of negativity is already priced in, especially when it comes to commercial properties. If you agree, you may want to consider the iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (BATS:ICF). This is a passively managed exchange-traded fund that offers access to the largest names and brands in office, retail, residential, industrial, and other property sectors. And because REITs must by law pay out 90 percent of their income in dividends, it's especially appealing for income-oriented investors.\n\nA Look At The Holdings\n\nICF's portfolio includes 30 REITs which tend to have market dominance in their respective property sectors. No position makes up more than 8.17% of the portfolio, making this relatively top-heavy.\n\nishares.com\n\nWhat do these companies do? American Tower Corporation is an owner and operator of wireless and broadcast communication real estate, leasing space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and TV broadcast companies, wireless data providers and utility companies. Prologis, on the other hand, is a global industrial REIT that owns and operates logistics real estate in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Equinix, Inc is a data center real estate investment trust that offers colocation, interconnection and managed services to companies that use data, such as enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and network service providers. And rounding out the top 5 is Welltower Inc., which is a health care real estate investment trust that owns properties in senior housing and health care, including assisted living facilities, memory care communities and post-acute care centers.\n\nSolidly diverse among the leaders in each REIT category. Something I think is a big positive.\n\nSector Composition and Weightings\n\nICF's portfolio is spread across six subsectors, limiting concentration risk and providing balanced exposure to the REIT arena. Telecom Towers make up 16.5% of the fund, followed by Retail and Data Center REITs. Notice Office makes up about 4%, so if still worried about that part of the market, it's not a big portion anyway.\n\nishares.com\n\nPeer Comparison\n\nOne fund worth comparing against is the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE). This fund tracks the Real Estate Select Sector Index, which includes REITs and real estate management and development companies. When we look at the price ratio of ICF to XLRE, we find that ICF is recently outperforming, but has largely lagged for 4-5 years.\n\nstockcharts.com\n\nThe top 10 positions look similar, but the weightings are different, which explains the performance differential overall. Both funds, I think, are good for broader exposure.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nOn the positive side, ICF gets you exposure to a broad basket of large-cap REITs that dominate their specific property sectors. These are the blue-chip equivalents of the REIT space. And there's a decent yield at 2.9% with capital appreciation potential.\n\nycharts.com\n\nThe risk? Real estate cycles are affected by interest rates and consumer spending trends. The fund invests in REITs related to the retail, office, industrial, hospitality and self-storage property sectors that could be impacted by evolving consumer behavior and the workplace. And if rates don't get cut soon, REITs likely continue to languish overall.\n\nOddly enough, I'd argue that the low office sector exposure is a negative. Given how much bearishness there's been on office, the contrarian in me prefers a larger exposure there for more upside potential. That's likely just me, though. I just think that's probably the most undervalued REIT segment currently.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF provides access to a widely diversified portfolio comprising REIT stocks. Since it is based on a REIT index, ICF benefits from the experience of Cohen & Steers, one of the most successful real estate investment firms in the United States, which might improve the fund's likelihood of discovering attractive investment opportunities. I think overall it's a good fund, and the cycle should start to favor it soon. It's worth considering if you're looking for yield and a different return pattern than you tend to see from typical stocks and bonds.",

        "body": "\u201cIn this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,\u201d says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry \u2013 today it\u2019s \u201cmaybe 50%\u201d, he says.\n\n\u201cYou only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.\u201d\n\nThe oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking.\n\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis \u2013 fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction \u2013 is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world\u2019s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe.\n\nView image in fullscreen Union Street in Aberdeen\u2019s city centre. The city prospered from North Sea oil. Photograph: Andreea Dragomir/Alamy\n\nIn the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss.\n\n\u201cMost of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?\u201d Douglas says.\n\nThis is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week\u2019s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas \u2013 and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?\n\nFor Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors \u2013 not just across the UK but also in other countries \u2013 to see if we can take working people on this journey.\n\n\u201cIt is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise \u2026 we simply can\u2019t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The end of the miners\u2019 strike at Selby coalfield in Yorkshire in 1985. Many communities were decimated by pit closures under the Thatcher government. Photograph: World Image Archive/Alamy\n\nThe spectre of the miners\u2019 plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers\u2019 union never recovered.\n\nArguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights \u2013 describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.\n\nThe UK\u2019s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to \u201cmax out\u201d oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising \u201cnot a single job\u201d will be lost during the transition.\n\nIn response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions \u2013 although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,\u201d said Minio-Paluello. \u201cThe risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade \u2013 from 441,000 to 214,00 \u2013 during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.\n\nAccording to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only \u201caround the edges\u201d. Even BP\u2019s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is \u201cnot going to make any difference\u201d to Britain\u2019s energy security.\n\nAjay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:\u201cThe UK\u2019s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour\u2019s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Climate activists protesting against drilling in the North Sea. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nCritics of the Tory pitch to \u201cmax out\u201d North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities.\n\nAnalysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of \u00a388,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of \u00a351,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of \u00a329,000 in Scotland \u2013 and above the \u00a342,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\n\nAs high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland\u2019s employment sector could plummet from \u00a319bn a year in 2019 to \u00a312bn by 2050, according to the report.\n\nFor people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,\u201d says the 39-year-old scaffolder. \u201cIt has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life \u2013 to look after my children, get a house, get a car.\u201d\n\nDale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations.\n\n\u201cTaking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,\u201d said Green.\n\nIf it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to \u201csecure a future for every oil and gas worker\u201d. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.\n\nView image in fullscreen Wind turbines at the Seagreen offshore windfarm, under construction off the coast of Montrose in the North Sea.

They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables.\n\nUnite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party\u2019s manifesto at its \u201cclause V\u201d last month \u2013 in part because of fears Labour\u2019s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague.\n\n\u201cWe should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,\u201d Graham said earlier this year. \u201cThese types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.\u201d\n\nThe union is running a grassroots \u201cNo ban without a plan\u201d campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from.\n\nPreviously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging.\n\nLast week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a \u201cclear and funded\u201d transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland.\n\nA spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed \u201csupport from the climate movement\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart \u2026 we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.\u201d\n\nRuby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows \u201chow far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships\u201d.\n\n\u201cGovernment support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.\u201d\n\nJake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government\u2019s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition.\n\n\u201cIf I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.\u201d\n\nBut he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and \u2013 if done correctly \u2013 positive.\n\n\u201cMore and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change \u2013 change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we\u2019ve worked in for the last 40 years.\u201d\n\nMolloy warns that many of the much-heralded \u201cnew jobs\u201d in renewables do not exist in Scotland \u2013 citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments.\n\nTessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to \u201cget everyone around the table \u2013 the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities \u2013 to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone\u2019s interests\u201d.\n\nCrucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren\u2019t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.\u201d\n\nLast month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.\n\nExperts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor.\n\nA Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate.\n\nMolloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I\u2019ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future \u2013 and that of millions around the world \u2013 relies on us getting this right.\u201d",

        "body": "House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.\n\nBritain\u2019s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.\n\nOn an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3266,604 in June, Nationwide said.\n\nHouse prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.\n\nRobert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.\n\n\u201cAs a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay \u2013 well above the long run average of 30%,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed \u00a31.2bn of mortgage debt, down from \u00a32.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.\n\nOfficial figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank\u2019s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Twice as many Britons support tax increases to pay for public services as those who believe they should be reduced even if it means further public service cuts, according to new a report.\n\nA study released by abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a research body set up by the fund manager, said the public are willing to support policies that they don\u2019t think will benefit their own finances, despite almost two in five (39%) of households now classed as having serious financial difficulties. The number of households with finances in distress has increased by 2.9 million since the last election in 2019, when 28% were in that situation.\n\nAbout a third of the 5,572 people surveyed said they supported raising their taxes if it benefitted other people with more hours of free childcare, cheaper energy tariffs for lower-income households and an increase in child benefit.\n\nMubin Haq, the trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cPeople realise in terms of what the parties are promising on public services that there is a massive gap on what\u2019s needed and what money is available. That is why the public backs these tax rises, because they would rather have that than even more deterioration of public services.\u201d\n\nBoth parties have ruled out tax rises for income tax and VAT, while the Conservatives have said they would knock 2p off national insurance contributions, cut stamp duty and give a tax break to pensioners.\n\nIn June, the Guardian reported that the Labour party has been drawing up options to raise money to rebuild public services with extra wealth taxes.\n\nThe next government will have to implement further cuts of between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn on unprotected Whitehall departments if it wants to reduce debt and avoid raising taxes, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\n\nHowever, the head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, said a Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules before it embarked on another round of cuts. Johnson said the pressures on public spending were so powerful that he could not envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "sshepard\n\nCo-authored by Treading Softly\n\nThere's a classic saying that \"if you can't beat them, join them.\"\n\nWhen it comes to approaching the market to gather income from your holdings effectively, there can be areas in the market where you cannot produce better income than the companies that already exist there. The banking sector has existed for an exceptionally long time and continues to be a vital part of the economy because it provides financial services that other companies and sectors have not been able to effectively provide on their own. We've seen that when companies want to provide similar services, they become a bank; look at NewtekOne (NEWT) for example. They were a fantastically well-run BDC (Business Development Company), but they decided that they wanted to expand their offerings to be more of what a financial institution would be. So, they decided to become a bank because they could not keep up with banks without becoming one themselves. They effectively said we can't beat them, so we're going to join them.\n\nIf you're following our unique Income Method to generate a livable yield from your investments to pay your expenses and live your life to the fullest, sometimes you need to accept that when it comes to the financial sector, there's not much better you can do but to join the banks.\n\nIn this regard, I want to examine two different ways that you can join the banks. One involves investing in a vast array of financial institutions, and the other involves investing in the same types of assets that banks are investing in themselves.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\nBTO \u2014 Yield 9.3%\n\nJohn Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO) is a CEF (Closed-End Fund) that invests in banks. Banks have fallen out of favor in the past couple of years, as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank sparked fears of another bank-driven financial crisis. More than a year later, we can see that the fears failed to materialize into reality, as it turned out the boogeyman wasn't actually under the bed.\n\nIn terms of assets, the bank failures of 2023 were huge. The news media became hyper-sensitive, and fears of bank panic spreading were everywhere. Some might find it surprising that bank failures are fairly common. From 2015 through 2019, 25 banks failed with little fanfare. Source\n\nFDIC\n\nWhat was startling last year was not the number of bank failures, but the sheer amount of assets, as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank was huge. Yet, as we sit here today, we can be confident that it wasn't a \"Lehman moment\", as some were suggesting at the time. During the crises, we noted that the issues with Silicon Valley Bank were specific to them and not indicative of a systemic crisis.\n\nFast-forward to today \u2014 banks are no longer at panic prices but are still trading at very attractive valuations. The market stopped panicking, but is still a bit cautious about banks. For BTO, this means that the price is currently trading at a discount to Net Asset Value.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nFor a fund that routinely trades at a healthy premium, this is a buying opportunity.\n\nWe continue to believe that the structural risks for banks are much lower than some in the market believe. Banks were stressed by declining Treasury prices on their balance sheets, but as interest rates stabilize, the shock of the impact is dissipating. If interest rates start declining, that will speed up the process, but it is hardly required. The Treasury portfolios that the bears loved to point to as having huge unrealized losses are slowly curing themselves as Treasuries mature at par and are reinvested into new Treasuries at today's higher rates.\n\nWhile there is certainly some stress on commercial real estate that could cause credit losses at some banks, we don't see anything that is nearly as significant as the ubiquitous mortgages and CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations) that collapsed during the GFC. Banking regulations are a lot more strict, and the positioning of banks is far more conservative. We are not in a period where credit issuance was high and irresponsible. Whatever overenthusiasm there was in the credit markets, experienced a bucket of cold water during COVID. As a result, credit quality is relatively strong among borrowers compared to other pre-recession periods. This is why we expect that if there is a recession, it is unlikely to be a severe one for lenders. This includes bank and non-bank lenders.\n\nJAAA and CLOA \u2014 Yield +6%\n\nBlackRock AAA CLO ETF (CLOA) and Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) are funds that offer attractive 6% yields. When we usually talk about CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligations) funds, we focus on funds on the bottom side of the CLO structure. The equity and subordinated tranches offer extremely high yields in this environment. Source\n\nECC Earnings Call Presentation\n\nThis would be the higher risk but much higher reward side of things. If you've read our articles on OXLC (Oxford Lane Capital) or ECC (Eagle Point credit), which invest in the bottom level of a CLO, the equity tranche, which offers the highest risk but highest reward. We have also suggested the idea of investing in Eagle Point Income Company (EIC), which invests in the subordinated debt section of a CLO.\n\nMany have asked us about safer options. These two ETFs invest in the largest section of a CLO, which predominantly and historically has been owned by high-net-worth individuals, financial institutions like major banks, and insurance firms. That's because Triple-A CLO debt is considered to be among the lowest-risk debt investments possible alongside highly rated corporate bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury notes.\n\nThese senior tranches have little credit risk because the entire structure of a CLO is designed to ensure that the AAA tranches get paid first. However, the underlying borrowers are still rated B/B+. As a result, these investments provide a slightly higher level of income than a Treasury note. However, unlike fixed-income alternatives, Triple-A CLO debt is a floating investment.\n\nIf you expect interest rates to remain higher for longer and want a place to put cash that offers a higher yield than Treasury notes, these ETFs are a reasonable option. It is worth noting that the distributions will be variable and will decline if interest rates decline.\n\nIn terms of price volatility, JAAA/CLOA can be expected to have relatively low price swings. The price will be sensitive to changes in interest rate outlooks and could be impacted by default fears, but likely far less than many other investments. To be clear, the risk is low relative to other investment options, and it would be reasonable to put investment money here to earn a higher yield while you wait for opportunities to deploy it. It is a place for money where you want lower risk. However, it is not a safe place for money where you cannot tolerate any risk like your emergency fund. Price swings over a month or two are likely to be in the low single digits, but they can happen and, in a panic-type event, could be larger.\n\nI know a lot of investors are looking for a lower-risk place to put their cash that can earn a higher yield than maybe their money market account from their brokerage is offering. These two funds are a great opportunity with the understanding that the yield will decline in concert with changes in short-term interest rates.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith BTO, JAAA, and CLOA, we have multiple routes to be able to invest alongside or in financial institutions that allow us to enjoy strong income from them. BTO gives you exposure to a vast array of financial institutions to collect a great yield from the effectiveness of experienced fund managers. CLOA and JAAA provide us a route to invest in Triple-A CLO debt to collect a higher yield income at very low risks, right alongside financial institutions that invest in this type of debt, MBS, and Treasury notes. At the end of the day, our goal is to maximize the income we can receive and minimize the risks that we take on. These opportunities today allow us to hit that sweet spot between risk and reward to be able to collect great income without having to take on outsized risk.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, the greatest risk you face is becoming financially destitute. Unfortunately, it's a fact of life that as we get older, our health will wane, and we will need to invest more of our time and energy into maintaining our health. The last thing you want to do is worry about your finances while you're taking care of your health and enjoying retirement with your loved ones. This is why I created my Income Method in the first place, to help solve some of retirement's biggest burning questions and meet those needs head-on. That's the beauty of my Income Method. That's the beauty of income investing. Today, it's time to decide that if you can't beat the sustainable income generation of our Income Method, it might be time to join it.",

The company has vibrant history, and it can even be called iconic. Its profitability is still stellar and recent earnings show that there is still some potential to expand left.\n\nOn the other hand, the business mostly consists of units operating either in highly competitive or highly saturated industries. Wall Street analysts do not expect any real growth in revenue for the next decade, and this projection looks fair due to the company's absence in any thriving industries. Capital allocation approach of the past decade also looks questionable as high leverage for new projects did not help to create more value for shareholders. The stock is more than 30% undervalued, but I consider it fair given stagnating financial metrics and no exposure to emerging industries. All in all, I assign CMCSA a \"Hold\" rating.\n\nCompany information\n\nComcast is one of the largest cable and telecommunications company in the United States. The company's offerings include television, high-speed internet, and telephone services.\n\nThe company's fiscal year ends on December 31. Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment is the largest revenue and EBITDA contributor to the company's consolidated P&L. This segment's offerings include residential broadband, video revenue, advertising. For more detailed information regarding each segment readers can refer to the latest 10-K report.\n\nComcast's latest 10-K report\n\nFinancials\n\nComcast's financial performance over the last decade has been solid with a 6.5% revenue CAGR and stable gross margins. On the other hand, the operating margin shrank by the end of the decade below 20%. The FCF margin has been consistently positive, ranging between high single-digits and low double-digits.\n\nAuthor's calculations\n\nCapital allocation looks questionable. Debt levels are high and liquidity ratios are quite low. High debt level is not a problem itself, but when we look at it with the context of stagnating operating profitability, there are questions about the necessity of this high leverage to finance new projects. On the other hand, the current debt level is much lower compared to five years ago, which is a positive trend. Moreover, CMCSA blended rather aggressive deleveraging with solid dividend growth. Though, the stock's forward 3.24% dividend yield is still lower than 10-year Treasuries yields by around one percentage point.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe latest quarterly earnings were released on April 25, when the company delivered positive revenue and EPS surprises. Revenue growth was quite modest with a 1.24% YoY increase. The adjusted EPS expanded from $0.92 to $1.04 YoY. The good news is that the EPS expansion was partially achieved with the operating leverage as key profitability metrics showed modest expansion.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe upcoming earnings release is scheduled for July 23. The Q2 revenue is expected by consensus to be $30.10 billion, which will mean a slight YoY decrease. The adjusted EPS is expected to follow the top line with a one cent YoY decrease. Wall Street's sentiment around the upcoming earnings release is quite weak because there were fourteen EPS estimates downgrades over the last 90 days.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLong-term revenue and EPS consensus estimates are not very promising. Revenue is expected to grow approximately in line with inflation, while the EPS is expected to slight outpace revenue growth. It is difficult to agree here with EPS projections because due to the long-term inflationary effect on costs it will be almost impossible to drive profitability expansion without top line growth.\n\nThe entertainment industry has changed significantly over the last ten or fifteen years. Younger generations prefer streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Disney + (DIS), YouTube (GOOGL), Apple TV (AAPL) and dozens of other players. Video consumption increasingly shifts to these services, making traditional cable television less relevant in modern world. And this is a global trend, not only confronted in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to intense competition from formidable players in video streaming, Comcast also faces amplified competition from telecom providers and satellite broadcast firms. Telecom operators are actively marketing high-speed internet, digital phone services, which are usually bundled into quite appealing offerings for customers.\n\nThe sentiment around CMCSA looks weak and the stock has been falling over the last several months despite the broader market rallying. As one of the greats said, the stock market is a voting machine over the short-term. That said, CMCSA's share price might continue stagnating until the market's sentiment improves. While tech giants continue beating their all-time highs in 2024, it is difficult to say when investors will pay attention to value stocks like CMCSA.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nValuation\n\nThe stock declined by 6% over the last twelve months and the YTD performance is also disappointing with a 10% decline. The stock currently trades closer to the lower end of the last 52 weeks' range. Comcast's valuation ratios look very attractive both compared to the sector median and historical averages. That said, the stock is undervalued from the perspective of ratios.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nTo determine the upside potential, I am simulating the discounted cash flow [DCF] model. I use a 7.42% WACC recommended by Gurufocus. Consensus projects revenue to deliver around 2% CAGR over the next decade, which looks applicable for my DCF model. Since revenue is expected to compound in line with inflation, I do not expect the FCF margin to show notable improvements. Therefore, I use a flat 10.2% FCF ex-SBC margin, which is the past decade's average.\n\nAuthor's calculations\n\nAccording to my DCF simulation, the fair value of the business is $201 billion. This is 34% higher than the current market cap and such an upside might look attractive for some investors. However, I think that the discount is fair given the fact that the company's revenue and profits are expected to be almost flat on a nominal basis, and the current dividend yield is still notably below the risk-free rate.\n\nRisks to my cautious thesis\n\nShifts in the market sentiment are difficult to forecast. Some unfavorable news like the Fed unexpectedly deciding to introduce few more rate cuts due to the strong stance of the U.S. economy might cause a selloff in growth stocks. This can lead to a notable rotation of investors' capital to stocks like CMCSA due to their attractive valuation and solid dividend growth. In this case my cautious thesis will not age well.\n\nComcast's business boasts various segments, and the company has a lot of assets. This means that the company has a huge room for restructuring, divesting, and investing. For example, Disney's stock (DIS) also suffered a lot of pain before Bob Iger returned and started executing his transformation plan. Despite DIS still trading below pre-pandemic levels, it is difficult to deny that the stock became much more interesting to investors after Bob Iger started the turnaround and it even showed periods with notable rallies. For companies with diversified assets and segments there is always a possibility for restructuring and creating new synergies.\n\nBottom line\n\nTo conclude, CMCSA is a \"Hold\". A notable discount to the share price looks fair given no exposure to notable secular growth drivers. On the contrary, most of Comcast's businesses operate in highly saturated markets where there is almost no room for growth.",

        "body": "marketlan/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost of my articles are about \"big picture\" developments. I'm not only doing this to use them as a foundation for stock picks but also because I believe that discussing major developments is sometimes more important than discussing individual stock picks.\n\nI also want to provide value for people who may not like my stock picks to have info for their own stock selection.\n\nSome big-picture developments we have frequently discussed are (some more than others):\n\nThe energy bull case.\n\nArtificial intelligence.\n\nA top-heavy S&P 500.\n\nInflation.\n\nSupply chain re-shoring.\n\nBiden/Biden picks.\n\nGreen transition.\n\nNeedless to say, a lot of these topics are in some way related. This includes the impact of artificial intelligence on energy demand and the composition of the S&P 500, which is something I want to discuss in this article.\n\nThe S&P 500 just exited the first half of this year. It returned 14%, which is the second-best first-half performance this century.\n\nSpeaking of this century, the number of record highs (31) in the first half of this year is also the second-highest number this century.\n\nBloomberg\n\nSince the lows on October 12, 2022, the market has added $16 trillion in value, most of it coming from technology and communications services. The same goes for the first six months of this year.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWhat's interesting is Nvidia (NVDA) was a huge outlier, adding more than 200 points to the S&P 500 in the first half, with a number of \"big guys\" adding more than 40% year-to-date.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWhile this is great for people who simply own the S&P 500, it has created a very unusual situation, as the equal-weight S&P 500 has underperformed the market-weighted S&P 500 (the \"normal\" S&P 500) by the widest margin in the first six months of a year ever.\n\nThis is what the underperformance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 compared to the S&P 500 since October 12, 2022, looks like:\n\nBloomberg\n\nAs of June 27, the biggest six companies in the S&P 500 account for 31.4% of the S&P 500!\n\nThese companies are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nWhat do these companies have in common?\n\nThey all have turned into AI plays.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not \"hating\" on these companies. They all have phenomenal products, pristine balance sheets, and bright futures.\n\nThe problem I see is diversification. The S&P 500's purpose is to offer diversified exposure. Right now, it has turned into an AI play, with most sectors lagging behind.\n\nIf the AI rally runs into trouble, the S&P 500 is likely poised to underperform - especially because it is now valued at 21x earnings, indicating subdued returns in the years ahead (see the chart below).\n\nJPMorgan\n\nAgain, I'm not making the case the AI rally is over. This is simply a risk/reward assessment. As much as I believe AI enthusiasm was justified, it's not something that will last forever, especially because expectations are now sky-high.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the average investor is now looking at a high likelihood of subdued returns in the years ahead.\n\nBecause the S&P 500's surge was mainly fueled by tech, a lot of companies have been left in the dust - often with great valuations and potential.\n\nIn this article, I'll present three dividend stocks that all trade at very attractive valuations, have great business models, and come with either high income or consistent dividend growth.\n\nI own one of them and have the other two on my watchlist.\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) - A Struggling Giant With Tremendous Potential\n\nNorfolk Southern was one of the first dividend stocks I bought, as I wanted to own a company with a good dividend growth track record, an ultra-wide moat, and the ability to benefit from secular growth like economic re-shoring.\n\nRegarding its moat, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Norfolk Southern is one of America's largest Class I railroads, which enjoys a duopoly with its peer CSX Corp. (CSX) in the Eastern third of the United States.\n\nAssociation of American Railroads\n\nBecause of its dominant position, it enjoys a very wide moat, which is one of the reasons why it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 and most non-rail transportation peers.\n\nUnfortunately, the company's stock has been lackluster since early 2022, when it started to encounter a number of headwinds, including weaker economic growth, falling consumer sentiment (NSC is a major intermodal railroad), a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and ongoing operating challenges.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nIn other words, the company has somewhat lost its way, which was reflected in poor 1Q24 earnings, when the company reported 2% lower revenues, 1% higher expenses, and 6% lower operating income - adjusted for the East Palestine derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\nIt now has an operating ratio of 69.9%, which is a horrible result.\n\nWith that said, I am a buyer of NSC, as I am a big fan of buying undervalued stocks with turnaround potential - especially in critical supply chains.\n\nPressured by activist investors, NSC is working hard to turn its business around, which includes cutting costs and improving rail operations.\n\nOur strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mageau demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\nIf the company is able to lower its operating ratio to 66% by the end of this year, it could massively improve investor confidence.\n\nAs we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call\n\nWhile I wait for this turnaround to get support from better economic growth, I enjoy a 2.5% dividend. This may not be a juicy yield. However, it comes with a 46% payout ratio and a five-year CAGR of 10.2%.\n\nOver the past ten years, this dividend has risen by 137%. The share count has been reduced by 27%.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nCurrently, NSC trades at a blended P/E ratio of 18.2x.\n\nAnalysts expect a 1% EPS recovery in 2024, potentially followed by 17% and 14% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nThis paves the way for a fair price target of $275, 28% above its current price.\n\nOn a longer-term basis, I'm much more bullish, as I expect NSC to go back to its old glory, especially if it gets a much-needed tailwind from economic growth.\n\nWhile I have been buying gradually, I'm going to be a much more aggressive buyer *if* NSC drops to or below $200.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) - Undervalued Dividend Growth\n\nZoetis has become one of my favorite healthcare stocks. The former Pfizer (PFE) spin-off has become the world's largest producer of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and similar for animals.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nThe company's portfolio covers eight core species and seven therapeutic areas and holds 15 blockbuster drugs among roughly 300 product lines.\n\nWith regard to patent loss risks, the average market life of key brands in its portfolio is 30 years, including anti-infectives, dermatology, vaccines, pain and sedation, and others.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nWhat matters is that the company holds the number one market share in:\n\nNorth America, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nDermatology and pet pain.\n\nCompanion animals, cattle, and fish.\n\nIt has also consistently outperformed its peers, growing revenues by 8% annually since its IPO in 2013.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nThrough 2033, the company expects to maintain consistent growth, as it believes its total addressable market will grow by 4-6% annually to at least $75 billion by 2033.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nIt also has consistently grown its margins, which boosted adjusted net income by 109% in the 2017-2023 period.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nWith that said, ZTS is down 12% year-to-date, which was triggered by the news that its arthritis drug, Librela, could be harmful. I discussed this in an article published on April 14, when I went with the title \"Despite Lawsuit Risks: Why Zoetis Remains A Completing Investment.\"\n\nSince then, shares have rebounded 15%, beating the 6% return of the S&P 500.\n\nWhile lawsuit risks are always an issue in healthcare, I believe these fears are overblown, allowing investors to buy ZTS at attractive prices.\n\nCurrently yielding 1.0%, Zoetis comes with a payout ratio of 29% and a five-year CAGR of 22.7%. It also has outperformed the market by a wide margin over the past ten years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nMoreover, the company, which enjoys anti-cyclical demand, is currently trading at a blended P/E ratio of 31.3x, which is slightly below its normalized P/E ratio of 31.7x. While this may seem like a lofty valuation, analysts expect 8-10% annual EPS growth to last, potentially paving the road for 10-11% annual returns.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nAs such, I stick to my buy rating and believe ZTS offers a great risk/reward for dividend growth investors seeking healthcare exposure in a market with strong long-term secular tailwinds.\n\nWith that said, if you're looking for a higher yield, the next pick may be for you.\n\nSuncor Energy (SU) - A Dirt-Cheap Canadian Oil Play\n\nSuncor is the largest peer of my investment in Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). The company is one of the largest operators in Canada's oil sands and one of my favorite picks for income and capital gains.\n\nThe company has a number of benefits that I'm looking for in an oil company, which include deep reserves (more than 25 years of low-cost reserves), efficient operations in oil sands, and an increasing focus on shareholder distributions.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nMy most recent article on Suncor was written on May 19, when I called it \"One Of My Best Ideas In Energy.\" Since then, it held a special call in May when it presented its long-term outlook.\n\nDuring this call, it committed to an additional C$3.3 billion per year in free cash flow by the end of 2026, which translates to significant cash generation and shareholder returns.\n\nThis improvement comes with a targeted reduction in the company's WTI breakeven by $10 per barrel, which massively improves its free cash flow potential.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nMoreover, it has revised its net debt target for its 100% free cash flow payout to C$8 billion. That is down from C$9 billion. As I wrote in my prior article, expectations are for C$8.6 billion in net debt by the end of this year, which makes it likely that Suncor will reach its debt target next year.\n\nThis bodes well for shareholders, as the company aims to deliver over C$40 billion of AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) from 2024 to 2026, with a 10% compound annual growth rate, translating to a 15% growth rate on a per-share basis.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nCurrently yielding 4.2%, the company aims to grow its dividend by 3-5% annually, with most shareholder returns coming from buybacks.\n\nGiven the company's favorable production outlook, in 2026, it could generate north of C$8 billion in free cash flow at $75 WTI. That translates to 12% of its market cap. This bodes very well for buybacks and total returns!\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nWith regard to production, the company plans to increase upstream production by over 100,000 barrels per day while keeping controllable costs flat, which could potentially result in an 8% decline in operating cost per barrel over the next three years.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nAs I believe oil has much more room to rise than $75 WTI, I consider Suncor to be a \"hidden\" Canadian gem, which is perfect for a wide range of investors, including income and buyback-focused investors.\n\nPlease note that Suncor is listed both in Toronto and New York.\n\nValuation-wise, Suncor currently trades at a blended P/OCF (operating cash flow) ratio of just 5.3x, making it one of the cheapest energy stocks on my radar.\n\nApplying an 8.5x multiple, the company has a fair stock price of C$92 in Toronto, 76% above the current price. The same applies to New York-listed shares.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nNeedless to say, I believe SU has a lot of room to run the moment energy bulls return, making it one of my top picks in the sector.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe S&P 500 has surged, mainly driven by tech giants and AI enthusiasm. This concentration poses a risk if the AI boom slows.\n\nIt also left other promising sectors undervalued.\n\nIn this article, we discussed three compelling dividend stocks: Norfolk Southern, Zoetis, and Suncor Energy.\n\nEach offers unique advantages, from Norfolk's potential turnaround in the rail industry and Zoetis's leadership in animal healthcare to Suncor's massive potential in the energy sector.\n\nI believe these picks provide a great risk/reward in the dividend (growth) space and offer value in what has become a very challenging market.",

        "body": "aristotoo/E+ via Getty Images\n\nOverview\n\nThe market feels a bit more at ease after the first round of the French elections, as it seems that extreme policies will be avoided by an effort to deny the National Rally a legislative majority. French stocks have recouped some of their recent losses, and the euro reached $1.0775, its best level since June 13. The yen remains soft after the Tankan survey showed little change but an uptick in capex plans. Outside of the yen and Swiss franc, the dollar (DXY, USDOLLAR) is trading with a mostly softer bias. A handful of emerging market currencies are weaker today, including the Mexican peso. Central European currencies, though, a firmer in the wake of the euro's gains, but the South African rand is leading the emerging market currencies with nearly a 1% gain as a new government is falling into place.\n\nAsia Pacific and European equities began the new month on a positive note. All the large bourses in the Asia Pacific region were higher, but Australia (AS51), after MSCI's regional index posted its first weekly advance since early June last week. Europe's Stoxx 600 (STOXX) is snapped its own four-day down draft today, helped by the bounce in French stocks. US index futures are narrowly mixed. Bonds are continuing their pre-weekend slide European yields are 2-8 bps higher, with core-peripheral spreads narrowing and the French premium over Germany narrowing by around five basis points. The 10-year US Treasury yield (US10Y) is firm near 4.41% after rising 14 bps last week. Gold is trading quietly (~$2318-$2330) after settling last month slightly below $2327. August WTI continues to probe the $82 area. It reached $82.70 before the weekend but closed near $81.40.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nJapan's Tankan Survey was little changed from last quarter. Sentiment among large manufacturers ticked up, but there was no improvement for large non-manufacturers or smaller businesses. It did contain new information in terms of stronger capex plans (11.1% vs. 4.0% previously, missed expectations, 13.9%). It comes on the heels of the small increase in Tokyo's June CPI, which is a harbinger of the national report in a few weeks. At the end of the week, Japan will report May household spending. It rose in April (year-over-year) for the first time since February 2023. The combination of yen weakness and Governor Ueda's mission to normalize monetary policy suggests the risk is that both QT (fewer bond purchases than maturing issues) and a small rate hike are delivered at the end of the month. Minutes from the June RBA meetings are released tomorrow. They ought to be seen as a communication tool and the message from the meeting was that the central bank has not yet adopted an easing bias. Australia will report May retail sales on Wednesday. Wage growth and income tax cuts could boost consumption in the coming months. At the end of the week, Australia reports May merchandise trade. The surplus through April has fallen to about A$28 bln from around A$36.5 bln in the year-ago period. Exports have fallen by a cumulative 5.2%, while imports have risen by 2.9%. China's June PMI reading can only add to a pessimistic near-term economic outlook and underscore expectations for new action at the Third Plenum in the middle of the month. The composite PMI eased for the third consecutive month to 50.5, the lowest this year, from 51.0. Manufacturing remained at 49.5 for the second consecutive month in June. It was at 49.0 in June and December 2023. New orders and new exports are contracting. The non-manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 from 51.1. This is also a new low for the year. The Caixin manufacturing PMI edged up to 51.8 from 51.7. It has not fallen since last October.\n\nThe dollar has held above JPY160 since breaking the barrier in the middle of last week. It reached almost JPY161.30 ahead of the weekend. It is trading inside Friday's range after trading on both sides of the previous day's trading range but settled slightly above Thursday's high. The market knows it is risking intervention in what is arguably a one-way market. The dollar has a three-week rally in tow, during which it has appreciated by about 2.25%. The Australian dollar also traded on both sides of Thursday\u2019s range ahead of the weekend but settled within its range. It rallied from an eight-day low near $0.6620 and posted its highest close since June 3 (~$0.6675). It is trading firmly today but needs to convincingly break the $0.6600-$0.6700 range to be anything important. Meanwhile, yuan bears may be wary of official action in the offshore market and have been hesitant to push the dollar above CNH7.30. It is straddling that level for the fourth consecutive session. Chinese officials can engineer a squeeze in the offshore market by tightening liquidity, making it more expensive to short the yuan, and they could intervene directly. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1265 (CNY7.1268 on Friday). The central bank announced its intention to borrow bonds from primary dealers to sell to stem the decline in bond yields, which have fallen to record lows. The 10-year yield reached 2.18% today, while officials have suggested a 2.5%-3.5% range is appropriate.\n\nEurope\n\nThe first round of the French elections gave Le Pen's National Rally a plurality of votes, but even with a generous look at round two, it most likely will not secure an outright majority after the second round this coming weekend. The markets have responded well. French stocks have rallied around 1.4% and the French 10-year premium over Germany has narrowed by about five basis points. Meanwhile, tomorrow the preliminary aggregate June CPI will be reported, and the year-over-year rate is likely to be little changed from May's 2.6%, but for the rounding. Before the weekend, France, Italy, and Spain reported their figures and today, German states have. The national figure is due shortly, and it looks to have risen a mild 0.1% for a 2.4% year-over-year pace (down from 2.5%). Eurozone consumer prices appear to have accelerated in Q2 (4.3-4.4% annualized vs. 4.0% in Q1). Looking further ahead, the base effect warns of a difficult second half. In H2 23, eurozone inflation rose at an annualized rate of less than 1%. May unemployment is due at the same time. This is a good story. Eurozone unemployment reached a record low of 6.4% in April. It was at 7.5% at the end of 2019. The tightening of monetary policy and the economic slowdown, which included a small contraction in H2 23. The labor market has fared better than anyone reasonably expected.\n\nThe euro traded last week in the lower end of June's range. It traded below $1.0675 on three occasions since mid-June, and found good buyers each time. Pre-weekend position squaring ensured the euro snapped a three-week fall but stalled near $1.0725. The results of the French election have seen the euro jump to about $1.0775, its best level since the day after US May CPI (June 12). The euro has found intraday support in early European activity near $1.0750. Nearby resistance is seen in the $1.0785-$1.0800 area. Sterling traded in a narrow range ahead of the weekend of a little more than a fifth of a cent in both directions around $1.2640. It was confined to less than a cent range last week. The $1.2600 area offers important support. Sterling is trading firmer but has held below $1.2690. On the topside, $1.2700-$1.2710 offers nearby resistance. Still, the potential may extend toward $1.2735-65 in the coming days.\n\nAmerica\n\nNorth American participants have one eye on Thursday's holiday and one eye on Friday's jobs report. There is wood to be chopped first. On tap today, the ISM manufacturing is more important than the final PMI manufacturing survey (preliminary estimate rose to 51.7 from 51.3). Except for this past March, the ISM manufacturing diffusion index has been below 50 since October 2022. May construction spending is due, as well, and it fell in March and April. A 0.3% rise in May will nearly offset that decline. The highlight for Canada this week is also the employment report at the end of the week. Canada's unemployment rate is rising, and the Bank of Canada took advantage of the softer CPI measures to become the first G7 central bank to cut rates last month. The unemployment rate has risen from 5.7% in January to 6.2% in May. Canada created about 63k full-time jobs in the past five months. Mexico has a full schedule of economic reports this week, but the most market-sensitive data are today (May remittances and IMEF June survey) and tomorrow (June manufacturing PMI and April private consumption).\n\nThe US dollar posted an outside session ahead of the weekend against the Canadian dollar. It reversed from an eight-day-high near CAD1.3735 to CAD1.3655. Quarter-end position adjustments may have exacerbated the move, but the greenback still managed to settle within the previous day's range. Last week's low was near CAD1.3625. The greenback has not settled below CAD1.3600 since April 9. Canadian markets are closed today for Canada Day. The exchange rate is subdued today, and the greenback is in a narrow range (~CAD1.3665-CAD1.3690). The greenback also traded on both sides of Thursday's range against the Mexican peso ahead of the weekend. It also settled inside Thursday's range. Initially, the dollar reached a nine-day high against near MXN18.60 in the pre-weekend Asia Pacific session. It trended lower through Europe and the North American morning to approach MXN18.20 before bouncing back above MXN18.30. The US dollar is trading firmly today ~MXN18.2665-MXN18.4120) but within last Friday's range.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

        "title": "Baytex Energy: Clearwater Production Up As Advertised (NYSE:BTE)",
        "body": "bashta\n\nMy previous article (and many before it) stated that the main benefit of acquiring oil light production would be the ability for Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) to safely increase the Clearwater heavy oil production without \"betting the company\". As the first quarter report showed, that indeed happened. It is likely to happen a whole lot more. Management will also likely make the acquired Eagle Ford operation more efficient. But the big news is the Clearwater production.\n\nBaytex Energy Summary Of Production By Basin (Baytex Energy First Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release And Reports Filed With Sedar)\n\nThe Peavine area noted above is where the Clearwater production is. As will be seen later, the Clearwater production is easily the most profitable production in the portfolio.\n\nHowever, heavy oil production is a discounted product. That discount can widen during cyclical downturns such that the production needs to be shut in. Therefore, the profitability is only through part of the cycle. The Clearwater production may be low cost enough to survive a downturn while cash flowing. But that is highly speculative at this point. In the past, that has been a relative rarity as decent amounts of heavy oil production were shut in to prevent a negative (big negative) cash flow situation.\n\nAs a side note, management did sell some noncore Viking light oil production that likely lowered average costs as well.\n\nMost of the production increase came from the light oil Eagle Ford production acquired in the United States.\n\nEagle Ford Acquisition Financial Effects\n\nThe Eagle Ford production acquisition likely caused a \"step-up\" in those assets that has dramatically increased the depreciation. This increase along with operations optimization procedures and related acquisition costs caused profits to evaporate, but not cash flows.\n\nBaytex Energy Profitability Report By Country Before Corporate Expenses (Baytex Energy First Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release And Reports Filed With Sedar)\n\nThe way this is done, the light oil United States production results in cash flows that will be protected through the acquisition valuation (and subsequent depreciation charge shown above). Note how much the depreciation increased, even though production did not go up anything close to that for United States depreciation. At least part of that is the accounting effects of the acquisition.\n\nSo, the more valuable light oil cash flows will be protected from taxes. On the other hand, it will be a bit of time before that segment shows adequate profits (after allocated expenses) because it does take time to optimize large acquisitions.\n\nClearwater Profitability\n\nBut this company has another way to profit immediately by using those cash flows to obtain a much larger return in the current environment.\n\nBaytex Energy Portfolio Profitability By Drilling Area (Baytex Energy Corporate Presentation June 2024)\n\nAs shown above, the Clearwater area has by far the most profitable wells (I have ever seen for that matter). If it were not for the nature of the heavy oil profitability characteristics, the company could simply focus on heavy oil production and really forget the rest of the portfolio.\n\nIn the meantime, management essentially has a lottery ticket (that won) to higher profits as soon as management can mobilize the equipment. Investors can just bet that is happening as we speak. Already, the first quarter showed a big increase in production over the previous quarter in the comparison shown before. There is liable to be a lot more where that is coming from.\n\nCash Flow Opportunity\n\nManagement may even have the opportunity to increase cash flow even more:\n\nTamarack Valley Demonstration Of Clearwater Superior Profitability In Current Environment (Tamarack Valley Corporate Presentation February 2024)\n\nMore than one Clearwater operator is presenting that they are getting as many as 3 paybacks in roughly the current environment within 2 years (or sometimes less, depending on the operator). Baytex Energy shows a payback period of 10 months (which by the way is not bad). This operator, Tamarack Valley (OTCPK:TNEYF), has two payback periods in the first year while beginning a third payback period.\n\nFor Baytex Energy, this is a cash flow opportunity because cash is worth more now than later to any company (especially during a period of inflation). Tamarack Valley can drill two more wells in the same fiscal year to dramatically increase cash flow, while Baytex can drill one. Compounding could turn that into a huge cash flow build (rate) difference real fast.\n\nBaytex Energy has spent considerable time advertising the largest wells in the basin (in terms of initial production). However, for shareholders, profits are likely more important than large initial production results.\n\nBoth companies report fantastic profitability. So, they do agree on that.\n\nSummary\n\nBaytex Energy has the opportunity to take the Eagle Ford cash flow (after maintaining and optimizing production) to go for a far greater return on its Clearwater project. Shareholders can win both from the optimizing of Eagle Ford production after the acquisition and the growth of Clearwater production.\n\nNote that there is plenty of other production that is not as profitable. The other heavy oil production can be maintained so the leases do not expire (and the company loses control) while any growth goes to Clearwater.\n\nThis management, like others in the industry, is now finding other heavy oil areas where the latest technology can likewise be used for outrageous profits (until the next cyclical downturn).\n\nEagle Ford\n\nThe lowest cost light oil production is the Eagle Ford production. The acquisition likely increased the value of the non-managed leases where Marathon (MRO) is the operator. As a partner in those leases, Baytex as access to information that may well improve the acquired Eagle Ford results. Marathon is a well-known excellent operator in the basin.\n\nThe acquisition as also turned the company into an American light oil producer with heavy oil from a primarily Canadian producer which began in the heavy oil business. That may eventually mean a different valuation for the stock price now that it is listed on the NYSE.\n\nBaytex Energy Summary Of Operating Progress Since Acquisition (Baytex Energy Corporate Presentation June 2024)\n\nThe trend shown on the upper right likely means that profitability of the wells is increasing. Texas has a huge natural gas surplus. This often means that operators pay as much or more than the posted price to get rid of natural gas production so they can produce oil. There are benchmark prices and there are operators getting those prices and making a profit on natural gas production. But those often tend to be the integrated majors or large producers that can negotiate because they have large volumes to deliver. Smaller producers in some areas (and that can vary widely by both area and producer) often have little negotiating leverage.\n\nEven if producers get a decent price for natural gas, the oil production is far more profitable.\n\nThe production results shown above are not bad. The real question is how profitable the acquisition can be once management has things optimized. We probably will not know that for a couple of more quarters.\n\nA side benefit is that now most of the Eagle Ford production is operated by the company. Before, all the Eagle Ford production was operated by Marathon. It could increase the overall valuation of the non-operated properties because every operator has non-operated wells. But operating control of most of the production is usually more highly valued by the market.\n\nSummary\n\nThe light oil acquisition of Eagle Ford production has decent cash flow that will be protected by a big depreciation charge. How profitable that acquisition turns out to be remains to be seen. But it does allow management to develop the far more profitable Clearwater acreage right away, while it optimizes the Eagle Ford production. That is an unusual advantage for any acquisition.\n\nAdditionally, Baytex Energy may have the opportunity to improve the Clearwater cash flow by optimizing the length of the wells rather than going for the largest wells in the basin. Other operators seem to have a faster payback period. One example of that was given.\n\nThe issue remains a strong buy because Baytex Energy has the opportunity to come out ahead in several ways with that additional light oil production.\n\nI would expect in the upcoming quarterly report that there will be material progress in Clearwater and also some reporting on the profitability improvement of Eagle Ford production. All of this could continue to lower the corporate breakeven point more and result in better than anticipated cash flow. This could mean debt repaid ahead of schedule and more future cash flow available to shareholders than currently anticipated.\n\nThe acquisition of the Eagle Ford production may turn out to be the best thing that management has done in some time. While any large acquisition takes time to get where it is going, this is one case where shareholders could see the benefits unfold immediately in the Clearwater area.\n\nRisks\n\nAny upstream company is subject to the volatility and low visibility of commodity prices. Any severe and sustained price downturn can be extremely painful for a company with an objective to pay down debt. There is some hedging to mitigate the risk. This company also has some very low-cost production that puts it in a far better position than many competitors. But a sustained commodity price downturn can change the outlook for the company or even prove to be fatal.\n\nThe loss of key personnel could set back the company's plans. In particular, the loss of Eagle Ford personnel when the company is headquartered in Canada could prove to be a particularly tough challenge.\n\nAny acquisition can fail to meet expectations. This company has the Marathon information because it is a partner to Marathon, which helps with familiarity of the acreage and probably with best practices as well. That may well mitigate the risk.\n\nThe technology changes that periodically sweep the industry could stop \"tomorrow\". These changes often make acquisitions look better. But they can also cause the title of \"low-cost basin\" and \"low-cost acreage\" to change.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "FS KKR: Improvements In Non-Accruals And Portfolio (NYSE:FSK)",
        "body": "adventtr/iStock via Getty Images\n\nOverview\n\nFS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK) operates as a business development company that invests in upper middle companies through different forms of debt such as lending or equity investments. I previously covered FSK back in early April, and the performance since then has outpaced the S&P 500 (SPY) due to the consistently high levels of distribution. FSK currently has a dividend yield of 13% which makes it highly appealing to investors looking to add high levels of income to their portfolio. We can see that FSK outperforms the VanEck Vectors BDC Income ETF (BIZD) as well.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nFSK has a total return profile of nearly 39% over the last three-year period, which is a testament to its quality and consistency. A lot of the growth can be attributed to the prolonged period of higher interest rates. As interest rates rose, so did the earnings potential for this BDC, as the majority of their investments are done on a floating rate basis. However, the rise of interest rates have also revealed some weaknesses in the underlying quality of underwriting of their investments. This is the reason why I rated FSK as a hold the last time I covered it. I wanted to revisit now that we are at the midpoint of the year and provide some updated insights where possible.\n\nI previously rated FSK as a Hold during my last coverage, but I see signs of improvement with the portfolio structure and quality, which are contributing to my upgraded rating. Most importantly, non-accruals have decreased as a result of some portfolio weight shifts and increased investment activity. Let's first take a look at the strategy FSK uses to generate the income needed to support its high distribution rate.\n\nSlight Portfolio Improvement\n\nA part of FSK's approach is to remain highly diverse in order to eliminate any sort of concentration risk to any one specific industry or sector. We can see that the majority of FSK's investments are within the software and services sector, accounting for 16.5% of the fund's fair value. This means that FSK leans more towards technology-based companies and may experience more price upside during tech bull runs. This is closely followed by exposure to capital goods and commercial & professional services, making up 14% and 13.8% of fair value respectively.\n\nThe structure and exposure make up of their investments remain mostly the same from the last time I covered FSK. Software & Service exposure was slightly reduced from the prior level of 16.9%. When I last covered FSK, they had a small 2% weight in equity real estate investment trusts, but this has since been reduced and is no longer included in FSK's top sector breakdown. Their portfolio of investments has a fair value of $14.2B and about 205 different portfolio companies within.\n\nFSK Q1 Presentation\n\nDespite the original exposure to REITs being small, I still believe this to be an improvement. Real estate was the hardest-hit sector as a result of rising interest rates and still hasn't quite recovered. Just to give you an idea of how impacted the real estate sector (XLRE), take a look at the quick price performance comparison below. Real estate still remains in the negative compared to all of the other sectors. This is likely due to the sector's reliance on access to affordable debt financing that can go towards acquisitions, expansion efforts, and new project developments as a way to fuel growth.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nHowever, the investment strategy of FSK is pretty solid with a majority focus on senior secured debt investments. Approximately 65.2% of their investments are senior secured, and this offers a bit of security since senior secured debt sits at the top of the capital structure. This form of debt has the highest repayment priority before others in scenarios where a portfolio company may be going through a bankruptcy and liquidating assets. This helps protect against bad investments so that FSK can get some capital back instead of losing everything.\n\nFinancials & Risk Profile\n\nFSK reported their Q1 earning at the start of May and the results were mostly positive. Net investment income landed at $0.73 per share, while total investment income amounted to $434M. While total investment income was actually down 4.8% year over year, the NII per share performance was solid and aligned with Q1 results of prior years. What stood out the most during this latest quarterly report was the elevated levels of new investments that FSK made.\n\nAbout 75% of these new investments were allocated towards add-on financing to existing portfolio companies, since those relationships are already established and expectations are clear. The remaining percentage went towards new investments that may be able to contribute additional growth to their overall portfolio. These new originations stuck with their strategy by maintaining a 69% exposure to first lien senior secured loans. These new investments had a weighted average EBITDA of $243M and a 5.7x leverage rate.\n\nFSK Q1 Presentation\n\nThe last time I covered FSK, the effects of the higher interest rates started to reveal that some of FSK's investments may not have been high quality. At the time, the rate of non-accruals sat at 8.9% of the amortized cost of the total portfolio. This non-accrual rate has been improved and has now decreased to 6.5% at cost basis and 4.2% of fair value. This improvement is through a lower exposure to interest rate sensitive sectors like real estate and an increased level of new investments. The new investment growth has steadily risen now for a year straight, and the improvements are now being seen as FSK successfully adapts to the higher interest rate environment. Just as a reference, here are the non-accrual rates of some peer BDCs:\n\nAres Capital (ARCC): 1.7% non-accrual rate at cost.\n\nFidus Investment (FDUS): 1% non-accrual rate at fair value.\n\nCapital Southwest (CSWC): 2.3% at fair value.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWe can see that FSK and the federal funds rate share an inverse relationship. As interest rates rise, the level of NII (net interest income) rises due to the floating rate structure. The percentage of investments that are on a floating rate basis now sits slightly above 90% as of the latest Q1 report. This has helped FSK capture a much higher level of NII per share as rates increased. However, this also meant that non-accruals naturally increased as it put additional strain on the profitability on some portfolio companies. However, it seems like FSK has become accustomed to the rate environment and with the elevated levels of new investment activity, we may see non-accruals continue to decrease.\n\nWe sit in a bit of a uncertain spot because on one end, FSK has adapted to the higher interest rate environment and increased the quality of their portfolio. However, there are some indicators that point to interest rate cuts being on the horizon. Inflation has slowly started to cool and creeps closer to that 3% mark. Additionally, the unemployment rate has consistently crept up over the last few quarters and now sits at the 4% mark as the labor market weakens. Lastly, the US Presidential elections are at the tail end of the year and this may cause elevated levels of uncertainty in the markets. A combination of all of these factors may be enough of an incentive for the Fed to begin cutting rates. If rates start to get cut, we may see lower levels of NII per share, but this isn't the end of the world because lower interest rates would likely translate to a higher volume of potential borrowers that can offset any drop in earnings.\n\nLastly, the liquidity of FSK remains strong despite the non-accruals and elevated level of capital committed to new investments. FSK currently has $242M in cash and equivalents to help them navigate any additional headwinds. This cash is accompanied by over $3.6B in financing arrangements and credit availability. This level of liquidity is strong when considering that most of their debt maturities take place in 2026 and beyond.\n\nFSK Q1 Presentation\n\nDividends\n\nAs of the latest declared quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share, the current dividend yield sits at 13%. At the beginning of May FSK announced both a special dividend and a supplemental dividend so shareholders have been handsomely rewarded with extra income. The first supplemental distribution of $0.06 per share will be paid alongside the base distribution. The second supplemental of $0.05 per share was paid out at the end of May. The additional supplementals reinforce that FSK is successfully generating high levels of income.\n\nWhat amazes me about these supplementals is that FSK is externally managed by FS KKR Advisors. These high levels of supplementals are more common when looking at internally managed business development companies. This is because internally managed BDCs don't have to dish out a slice of their earnings to pay the management's fee. However, FSK is able to perform at this high caliber while being externally managed and the base distribution remains well-supported.\n\nAs previously mentioned, NII landed at $0.73 per share for Q1. This means that the quarterly dividend of $0.64 is supported at a coverage rate of 114%. This means that as long as rate remain elevated, I believe that the dividend should remain at the current levels. This high yield produces an impactful income stream that can grow to high levels over time with continued investment. Running a back test with Portfolio Visualizer, we can create a visualization of how an investment of $10,000 would have played out. This assumes that the $10,000 investment was made at the start of 2015 and an additional $500 was invested every single month. Additionally, the calculation also assumes that all dividends received were reinvested back into FSK.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nIn 2015, the dividend income received from FSK was $1,228. Fast forward to the full year of 2023 and the dividend income produced from your investment would now equal $13,188. This shows the insane compounding power of a high yielding BDC like FSK. Keep in mind that throughout the last decade, the interest rate environment has shifted back and forth and FSK has still managed to compound the dividend income at a relatively consistent rate over the last decade.\n\nValuation\n\nIn terms of valuation, FSK still trades below its pre-pandemic level and never quite fully recovered back to the $23 per share range after the covid related drop. A quick reference to the average Wall St. price target of $20.65 reveals that there's a potential upside of about 5% from the current levels. Since FSK operates as a BDC, the price can significantly vary from the underlying value of assets. As a result, FSK trades at a large discount to net asset value of about 19%. For reference, the price has traded at an average discount to NAV of 21% over the last three-year period.\n\nCEF Data\n\nHowever, the average discount to NAV level is more representative of the higher non-accrual rates at the time. Now that non-accruals has started to decrease and the shape of the portfolio improves through its decreased exposure to real estate and increased investment activity, I believe that the price of FSK may actually grow over time. Even if interest rates end up getting cut, FSK may increase in price and NAV and lower rates would likely serve as an incentive to a higher volume of borrowers for FSK to invest in. As a result, I am upgrading my rating to a Buy.\n\nTakeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I am happy to see that FSK's portfolio and non-accruals have improved over the last quarter. The poor non-accrual rate is what initially prompted my hold rating, and it's clear that management is trying to improve. The increased level of investments has the potential to yield higher levels of net investment income going forward. This is even more likely if we consider that lower interest rates may actually increase the volume of potential borrowers that FSK can invest in. FSK has maintained a well-balanced and diverse portfolio that has exposure across many different industries. NII per share covers the distribution at a comfortable margin and therefore gives confidence that the distribution remains safe in the current environment.",

        "title": "TSMC: Strategic Alliances Lift Stock To New All-Time Highs (NYSE:TSM)",
        "body": "BING-JHEN HONG\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is strategically positioned to capture a lion share of the AI-driven value accumulation within the semiconductor industry. The world's leading foundry service company is benefiting from the multi-year shift towards increased semiconductor content in mobile devices, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the further proliferation of the Internet of Things. Furthermore, TSMC's strategic alliances with key growth customers such as NVIDIA and Apple amplify its market position and commercial moat. Overall, I expect TSMC's revenue growth over the next 3 years to be above 20% CAGR, with a slightly higher expansion rate for EPS due to potential margin expansion. As a function of valuation anchored on a residual earnings model, I maintain a \"Buy\" rating on TSM stock, and set my target price at $200.\n\nFor context: TSMC stock has significantly outperformed the broader U.S. stock market this year. Since the beginning of the year, TSMC shares are up by approximately 67%, compared to a gain of about 15% for the S&P 500 (SP500).\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nStrong AI Momentum Drives EPS Upgrade Cycle\n\nOver the past 12-24 months, TSMC has enjoyed a strong upgrade cycle in EPS estimates, with analysts now expecting about $46 billion of EBIT next year (FY 2025), compared to approximately $43 billion expected back in December 2023.\n\nRefinitiv\n\nPointing to this bullish consensus momentum, I highlight that the earnings revision cycle is primarily driven by positive AI exposure. In fact, TSMC's advanced node and packaging segments are poised to benefit from hyperscalers' shift towards increasingly diverse data center ecosystems, as well as the growing demand for custom compute chips, also in mobile devices.\n\nMorgan Stanley mapped estimates for TSMC's AI GPU and ASIC revenue contribution trend from 2021 to 2027e, projecting a significant upward trajectory in AI-related sales towards 25% of total revenues. Specifically, TSMC's AI revenues are expected to increase from less than $5 billion in 2021 to over $30 billion by 2027. The growth upside underscores TSMC's strategic positioning in high-growth markets that anchor their momentum on AI--areas like autonomous driving, smart devices and edge computing, and cloud computing. In a broader context, growth is driven by three primary segments, including General-purpose AI, Custom AI chips (ASICs), and CoWoS/wafer test. (Source: Morgan Stanley, TSM research note dated June 17th: AI semi demand upside from Apple AI, OW).\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nOn that note, I am especially bullish on TSMC's partnership opportunities with major AI-winners including Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO). In fact, Apple and NVIDIA are significant contributors to the demand: Increasing demand and expanding requirements for high-performance, power-efficient GPUs is set to surge dramatically from 2023 onwards (see 3nm wafer demand, RHS). (Source: Morgan Stanley, TSM research note dated June 17th: AI semi demand upside from Apple AI, OW).\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nStrong Financial Performance\n\nTSMC's financial metrics illustrate the company's promising growth trajectory: Since 2019, TSMC's topline has almost doubled, growing from $35.7 billion to $70.2 billion (CAGR of 18-19%). Over the same period, gross profit has surged from $16.5 billion to $37.6 billion (CAGR of 22-23%), while operating profit jumped from $12.6 billion to $29.4 billion (CAGR of 23-24%). You see, there is solid operating leverage in TSMC's business model, with gross profit growth outpacing revenue growth, and operating income growth outpacing gross profit growth.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLooking ahead, I project TSMC's revenue growth to accelerate, for the reasons discussed in the previous section of this article. Moreover, I expect ongoing operating leverage to drive earnings growth ahead of top-line expansion. According to analyst estimates, the company is expected to maintain gross margins above 50%, with projections reaching nearly 60% by 2026 due to price hikes in advanced nodes (N3 and N5). In fact, NVIDIA's commentary on TSMC\u2019s low service prices highlights TSMC's ability to potentially increase wafer prices. Overall, I model a 20-25% CAGR in operating earnings up to 2027. This robust operating earnings growth supports TSMC's policy of distributing up to 70% of FCF as cash dividends, potentially doubling its dividend per share from $14 in 2024 to $30-35 by 2027 .\n\nValuation Update: Raise TP To $200/ Share\n\nAnchored on strong commercial momentum, which is projected to be maintained over the next few years, I am revising my valuation assumptions for TSMC stock. With gross margin and OPEX estimates based on analyst consensus estimates, with adjustments of +/- 10%, I now project TSMC's earnings per share for FY 2024 to range between $6.3-6.5 (non-GAAP). Additionally, I forecast these earnings will rise to $8.1 in FY 2025 and $9.3 in FY 2026. Beyond FY 2026, I anticipate a compound annual growth rate in earnings of approximately 3.25%, which is about 100 basis points above the projected nominal GDP growth and thus likely conservative. I am maintaining my cost of equity assumption at 9%. With these updates, I now assess the fair value of TSMC stock at $205, a significant increase from my previous estimate of $105, but still below TSMC's current market trading price.\n\nFor context, the value \"Speculation\" is just the difference to fair implied value. A positive value implies a premium; or in other words, markets are speculating to price more fundamental upside compared to my estimates.\n\nCompany Financials; Bloomberg & Author's EPS Estimates; Author's Calculation\n\nBelow also the updated sensitivity table.\n\nCompany Financials; Bloomberg & Author's EPS Estimates; Author's Calculation\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nTSMC is poised to capture a significant share of AI-driven value accumulation within the semiconductor industry, a trend that should extend for a few years. As the world's leading foundry service provider, TSMC is benefiting from a multi-year shift towards increased semiconductor content in mobile devices, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the proliferation of the Internet of Things. Overall, I expect TSMC's revenue growth over the next three years to exceed a 20% CAGR, with a slightly higher expansion rate for EPS due to potential margin improvements. Based on a valuation anchored on a residual earnings model, I maintain a \"Buy\" rating on TSMC stock, and set my target price at $200.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "CleanSpark Walks A Fine Line With Bitcoin (NASDAQ:CLSK)",
        "body": "Vertigo3d\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) has found itself in a unique position when compared to other BTC mining operators as the firm remains flush with cash, bitcoin holdings, and a growing operation with the goal of reaching 50exahash/second in eFY25. As the firm operates in a more challenging BTC mining environment post-BTC halving, management has been opportunistic in acquiring competing mining operations to expand and benefit from the challenging environment. In addition to this, CleanSpark is in the process of building out an additional 75MW of capacity in Wyoming for an additional 4.2exahash/second to be added to the fleet for a total of 20.9exahash/second. Inclusive of their 5 new facilities in Georgia, the firm will have a total of 31.6exahash/second. Given CleanSpark\u2019s expanding holdings of BTC and new operating facilities, I reiterate my BUY rating for CLSK shares with a price target of $28.67/share at 18x price/BV of BTC holdings.\n\nBe sure to review my initial coverage of CleanSpark here:\n\nCleanSpark May Benefit From The Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nCleanSpark Operations\n\nCleanSpark is entering the next stage in company development as the firm breaks ground at their newly announced 75MW mining facilities located in Wyoming. Management anticipates the 45MW mining operation to begin mining as soon as 120 days as of q2\u201924. This site is an existing site that will require CleanSpark to bring in their equipment as the previous tenant exits the space. The 30MW site is a greenfield project that will require more construction; however, management anticipates having both sites operational before winter begins in Wyoming. Management mentioned on the q2\u201924 earnings call that the firm has secured 50MW of transformers and switching gear in anticipation of the build-out as well as execution of their option to acquire 100,000 S21 Pro miners. These two facilities are expected to add an additional 4.2 exahash/second to the firm\u2019s existing 16.7exahash/second. CleanSpark will also have the flexibility to add additional capacity to these two sites for a total of 130MW for a total hash rate of 7.4exahash/second, leading to the firm having a total of 24.1exahash/second, a 44% increase to their existing hashrate.\n\nThese facilities will likely bring CleanSpark economies of scale as the new S21 Pro equipment is expected to lower the firm\u2019s average hash cost from $32 down to $28. This compares to their expected hash price of $50, resulting in the potential for wider operating margins in the coming year despite the BTC halving event. Overall operating capacity increased by 63%, leading to significantly stronger operations YTD.\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nLooking at CleanSpark\u2019s mining rate per exahash, it is clear that the halving event has affected operations as the BTC yield has significantly declined. Though I believe that this will impact the firm\u2019s operations and margins in the coming quarters, CleanSpark\u2019s operational efficiencies that have resulted from higher compute power and energy efficiency may help soften the blow to the bottom line. CleanSpark\u2019s average revenue per BTC mined significantly improved sequentially from $36.5k to $55k, adding significant cushion to their bottom line. As of the firm\u2019s May 2024 BTC mining update that was released on June 4, 2024, CleanSpark now holds 6,154BTC on its books.\n\nCleanSpark announced the acquisition of 5 new BTC mining facilities in Georgia for $25.8mm in cash on June 18, 2024. These facilities will add 60MW of infrastructure and is expected to increase the firm\u2019s hashrate by 3.7exahash/second to over 20exahash/second in total by the end of the month. Management noted that the data centers already have existing equipment on site and that the mining hardware has already been purchased.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, CleanSpark announced their intent to acquire GRIID Infrastructure based on an enterprise value of $155mm in an all-stock deal. CleanSpark\u2019s management announced that GRIID\u2019s Tennessee assets will adopt CleanSpark\u2019s mining operational efficiencies and will allow for the firm to expand their operations to 100MW in Tennessee by the end of CY24. Management also anticipates to reach 400MW by 2026.\n\nManagement made some very strong comments during the q2\u201924 earnings call about the state of the market for BTC miners. Zachary Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, discussed the imminent consolidation of the BTC mining industry as firms that operate at lower efficiency will likely be acquired or collapse as a result of the BTC halving event. Given the firm\u2019s recently announced acquisitions post-q2\u201924 earnings, it is clear that this process has begun and will likely continue throughout the duration of the year. Given CleanSpark\u2019s $681mm of liquidity as of q2\u201924, I believe the firm is in a prime position to continue outpacing less efficient mining operations and is well-position to acquire the laggards.\n\nManagement also provided an update on their Sandersville location. As of q2\u201924, CleanSpark was operating at 180MW of the expected 230MW capacity. As of the earnings call, the firm is constrained by the utility in testing their 50MW transformers in order to build out the new substation. Though this will somewhat hinder mining operations, I do not anticipate this to significantly impact the firm long-term as they near their goal of 50exahash/second.\n\nCleanSpark Financials\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nCleanSpark experienced a $119mm gain on the fair value of BTC as per the remeasurement rule, leading to an adjustment to the firm\u2019s reported total costs & expenses. Net of this adjustment, CleanSpark would have reported operating income of $17mm and net earnings of $7mm as opposed to the reported $137mm and $126mm, respectively.\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nThis reporting rule change can work to benefit CleanSpark as the firm has added significant amounts of BTC to the books since reporting q2\u201924 earnings results, assuming the price of BTC improves into the next reportable quarter. The downside risk is that the price of BTC may work against CleanSpark as the price/coin remains in a volatile state.\n\nTradingView\n\nValuation & Shareholder Value\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nComparing the price performance of BTC to CLSK, it is apparent that CLSK shares move in tandem with the direction of BTC given this accounting phenomenon.\n\nTradingView\n\nIf BTC were to continue its decline into the end of the reportable quarter for CleanSpark, the firm may report an impairment on their financials as a result of the price decline. Given this correlation, CLSK shares will likely be valued to the price of BTC as opposed to revenue or aEBITDA as it relates to the firm\u2019s sales of BTC. Given CleanSpark\u2019s multi-pronged valuation streams, I will value the firm based on aEBITDA generation paired with the value of BTC, as denoted by the two tables below.\n\nCorporate Reports Corporate Reports\n\nWith my expected aEBITDA generation, I believe CLSK shares should be priced at $28.67/share at 18x price/BV of BTC, providing the firm significant upside potential as the firm generates cash through the sale of BTC as well as manages their holdings of the token. I recommend CLSK with a BUY rating.\n\nAs denoted above, this buy rating comes with significant risks as CLSK shares are directionally motivated by the price of BTC. As denoted in the chart above, BTC appears to be rolling over and may continue this decline. One risk denoted in my recent report covering the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is that as more institutional investors migrate a portion of their holdings to BTC, additional inherent risks will be involved with the pricing dynamics, which include rebalances, cash raises, and potential correlation with the broader indices in the instance of a market selloff. Given that I am not a BTC trader, I cannot recommend CLSK beyond their operational risk as it pertains to BTC directional risk.",

        "title": "3 Of The Most Popular REITs And Why You Should Own Them",
        "body": "Kwarkot\n\nIn case you missed it, I wrote two articles last week.\n\nOne was titled \u201cWho Else Is Avoiding These 3 High Yielding REITs\u201d in which I suggested investors should avoid owning Granite Pointe Mortgage (GPMT), Service Properties Trust (SVC) and Global Net Lease (GNL).\n\nAll three of these REITs have a poor dividend history, and subsequently they have all experienced substantial price erosion.\n\nThe second article I wrote \u2013 also focused on high yield \u2013 was titled \u201cWho\u2019s Buying These High Yield REITs?\u201d\n\nUnlike the previous article I referenced, this one was targeting speculative higher yielding REITs such as Arbor Realty (ABR), Starwood Property Trust (STWD) and Ladder Capital (LADR).\n\nAs I concluded in that article, \u201clong-term REIT Investors should be looking for companies with dividends that are not just safe, but also have good growth prospects. A REIT that yields 10% almost always means that investors perceive very low growth, or potentially a dividend cut.\u201d\n\nLast week I lectured at Georgetown University, and I told the students:\n\n\u201cREITs are also dividend-paying companies, which is a great feature to begin with. But these particular dividend-paying companies come with a bonus: a unique structure where they have to pay out most of their net income to investors. Unlike traditional dividend-paying stocks, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their annual taxable income to shareholders. That makes their value proposition especially attractive, offering investors higher dividend yields as a general rule. Today\u2019s average REIT dividend yield is around 4.5%. That\u2019s significantly higher than the average yield for the S&P 500. Which is a measly 1.3%.\u201d\n\nI promised the students that I would provide them with a list of three of the most popular REITs and why I own them.\n\nI decided that I would provide the same list for you, my valued readers and followers here on Seeking Alpha.\n\nRealty Income (O)\n\nThis S&P 500 company is a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) that has been investing in single-tenant, free-standing commercial properties for the last 55 years.\n\nWhat started in 1969 with a single Taco Bell has turned into a 334.2 million SF portfolio made up of more than 15,000 properties that are located in all 50 states, as well as multiple countries throughout in Europe.\n\nRealty Income primarily invests in retail properties, which made up nearly 80% of its portfolio at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhile there has been some concern in recent years on how e-commerce will impact brick-and-mortar retail, O mitigates this threat by targeting retail properties used in defensive industries that are non-discretionary, service oriented, or low price point in nature.\n\nSome of the company\u2019s top industries include grocers, automotive service, restaurants, home improvement, and drug stores. O's largest industry is grocery stores, which makes up 10.1% of its contractual rent, followed by convenience and dollar stores, which make up 9.5% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nTo further insulate its portfolio from the threat of e-commerce, O has a material amount invested in industrial properties, which made up nearly 15% of the company\u2019s portfolio at the end of 1Q-24. While not nearly as significant as its industrial exposure, the company has also recently branched out into experiential properties, primarily casinos, and is even investing in data centers through a joint venture with Digital Realty (DLR).\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the company\u2019s portfolio generated annualized contractual rent totaling $4.8 billion.\n\nO - IR\n\nRealty Income\u2019s properties are leased to a tenant base totaling 1,552 that operate in 89 separate industries. The company estimates that ~90% of its total rent is resistant to e-commerce and resilient to economic downturns.\n\nThe company\u2019s top 20 tenants make up 36.3% of O\u2019s annual rent and includes well established businesses such as 7-Eleven, Dollar Tree, Wynn Resorts, and Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\nRealty Income\u2019s top tenant is Dollar General, which makes up 3.4% of its rent; however, it is the company\u2019s 2nd largest tenant that I want to focus on today.\n\nWalgreens (WBA) released its 3Q-24 operating results on June 27th and the market was not pleased as the stock is down roughly ~25% at the time of this writing.\n\nI won\u2019t pretend to know all the details surrounding the operational issues that WBA is facing, but the main takeaway as an O investor is that WBA has a strategic initiative to improve efficiencies by reducing costs. Part of this will involve store closures.\n\nDuring Walgreen\u2019s 3Q conference call, Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens stated:\n\nAs the convenient destination for millions of customers and driving $27 billion of retail sales, the store and its digital channels are central to our strategy and consumer experience. But the customers involved, demographics and preferences have shifted, and we need to reposition and operate our stores accordingly. Currently, 75% of our U.S. stores contribute roughly 100% of segment AOI. For the remaining 25% of the stores in our network, which are not currently contributing to our long-term strategy, changes are imminent. To start, we are finalizing a multifactor store footprint optimization program which we expect will include the closure of a significant portion of these underperforming stores over the next three years. Plans to finalize this number are in motion and we will update you in due course. For the remaining portion of this cohort, we are taking action to return them to profitability and deliver an improved customer experience. We will contemplate additional closures if performance does not improve, which includes external factors such as reimbursement rates.\n\nIn sum, around 25% of its U.S. stores do not sufficiently contribute to adjusted operating income (\u201cAOI\u201d) so those stores will either be closed or repositioned to deliver an improved customer experience.\n\nSo how will this impact Realty Income since Walgreens is its 2nd largest tenant?\n\nO - IR\n\nThe first thing to consider is that Walgreens has roughly 8,600 locations in the United States compared to the 403 properties it leases from Realty Income.\n\nWith these numbers, it is likely that many of the non-performing stores are owned by somebody else.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the hard numbers, so we can just assume this would impact 25% of the stores owned by Realty Income.\n\nWalgreens leases 403 properties from Realty Income, which makes up 3.4% of O\u2019s annualized contractual rent of $4.8 billion, or roughly $162.8 million.\n\nIf Walgreens closed 25% of the stores it leases from Realty Income, the contractual rent presumably would be reduced by the same 25%, or by roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe lost rent of $40.7 million would represent approximately 0.85% of Realty Income\u2019s 1Q-24 annualized contractual rent of $4.8 billion.\n\nAssuming this scenario plays out, the hit to O\u2019s annualized contractual rent should be less than 1% unless a disproportional amount of the non-performing stores are owned by the company.\n\nThis is also assuming that no stores can be \u201cturned around\u201d and that Walgreens has to close the entire 25% of its non-performing U.S. stores.\n\nTo add one more layer, only 1.1% of O\u2019s leases expire in 2024 and only 4.4% expire in 2025.\n\nThere is no information on which leases are expiring over the next several years, but it is likely that Walgreens will have some leases in effect longer than the next several years. In total, Realty Income\u2019s portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term of ~9.8 years.\n\nO - IR\n\nThis really showcases Realty Income\u2019s scale advantage. The company\u2019s 2nd largest tenant may close up to 25% of its U.S. stores, and if so, the impact to O\u2019s rental revenue should be under 1 percent. Talk about portfolio diversification!\n\nRealty Income has built and maintained a business model that has delivered consistent results year-after-year. The company has achieved positive AFFO growth in 27 out of the last 28 years and has a compound annual total return of 13.6% since it was publicly listed in 1994.\n\nAdditionally, the company is an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, as it has increased its dividend over the last 30 years without interruption. O pays monthly dividends and increases its dividend each quarter. Since 1994, the company has declared 646 monthly dividends and has increased its dividend for the past 106 consecutive quarters.\n\nRealty Income is a blue-chip REIT with a long history of consistent and reliable performance. The company has an investment grade balance sheet with an A- credit rating from S&P Global and solid debt metrics including a net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDAre of 5.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.5x.\n\nSince 2015, the company has had an average AFFO growth rate of 4.96% and an average dividend growth rate of 3.92%. O currently pays a 5.99% dividend yield that is well covered and trades at a P/AFFO of 12.89x compared to its 10-year average AFFO multiple of 18.78x.\n\nWe rate Realty Income a Strong Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nAgree Realty (ADC)\n\nAgree Realty is a net-lease REIT with an exclusive focus on the retail sector. The company specializes in the development, acquisition, and management of free-standing, net lease retail properties across the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, the company has a ground lease portfolio which accounted for nearly 12% of its annualized base rent (\u201cABR\u201d) at the end of the first quarter.\n\nADC has a market cap of approximately $6.1 billion and a 44.9 million SF net lease portfolio made up of 2,161 properties located across 49 states. At the end of 1Q-24 its portfolio was 99.6% leased, had a W.A. remaining lease term of roughly 8.2 years, and derived 68.8% of its ABR from investment grade (\u201cIG\u201d) tenants.\n\nAgree Realty places a lot of emphasis on the quality of its tenants and of its properties. Within the net lease space, ADC is highly regarded on both counts. Some of its IG tenants include Home Depot, Tractor Supply, Lowes, Costco, AutoZone, Walmart, Target, Sherwin Williams, etc.\u2026 you get the point, the company\u2019s tenants are leading retailers that operate high-quality properties.\n\nADC - IR\n\nAgree Realty\u2019s top tenant is Walmart, which makes up 6.0% of the company\u2019s ABR, followed by Tractor Supply and Dollar General, which make up 5.0% and 4.7%, respectively. ADC looks for retail properties that have an established omni-channel structure or that operate in industries that are resistant to e-commerce.\n\nBy industry, ADC\u2019s top category is grocery stores, which makes up 9.7% of its ABR, followed by home improvement which makes up 8.7% and auto service which makes up 8.4%.\n\nADC - IR\n\nOne thing that you won\u2019t see in ADC\u2019s top tenants is Walgreens.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ADC makes a point of it in its latest investor presentation that was published well in advance of WBA\u2019s latest earnings release.\n\nTitled \u201cInvestment Foresight\u201d the chart and information below highlight that ADC was well ahead of the curve and took proactive steps to reduce its exposure to Walgreens.\n\nBack in 2012, the company\u2019s exposure to Walgreens was 30%, and It now sits at just ~1%.\n\nIn 2017 management noted that its Walgreens concentration was down to 8.8%, which was below its goal of \u201csub-10% by year-end.\u201d\n\nIn 1Q-19, management mentioned that there was \u201csome work to do\u201d in the pharmacy space regarding the front end, or the retail component of the drug store.\n\nTwo years later, during ADC\u2019s 1Q-21 conference call, the company stated that it continues to \u201cfavor CVS as the sector leader, given their innovation and adaption to consumer preferences.\u201d\n\nIn early 2023, Walgreens was downgraded to Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and then downgraded again by Moody\u2019s to Ba2 in December of that same year.\n\nIt is still uncertain how Walgreens will ultimately do, but at this point it seems that Joey Agree and his management team made a pretty good call when the company took steps to minimize its Walgreens exposure.\n\nADC - IR\n\nADC has top-notch tenants, high-quality properties, and a very sharp management team. Add to that the company\u2019s fortress-like balance sheet with a BBB credit rating and excellent debt metrics including a pro forma net debt to EBITDA of 4.3x, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.9x.\n\nPlus, the company has no significant debt maturities until 2028 and overall its debt is well staggered with a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 7 years.\n\nADC - IR\n\nOver the past 10 years, ADC has achieved positive AFFO and dividend growth each year, even during the pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe company has delivered an average AFFO growth rate of 5.86% and an average dividend growth rate of 5.94% and is expected to grow AFFO per share by 4% in 2024 and then by 3% the following year.\n\nADC - IR\n\nADC pays a 4.91% dividend yield that is well covered and is currently trading at a P/AFFO of 15.15x, compared to its 10-year average AFFO multiple of 18.52x.\n\nWe rate Agree Realty a Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nVICI Properties (VICI)\n\nVICI is an experiential REIT that specializes in casinos across the U.S. and in Canada. The company\u2019s portfolio includes top entertainment, hospitality, and gaming destinations such as Caesars Palace Las Vegas, the Venetian Resort, and MGM Grand Las Vegas.\n\nIn the state of Nevada alone, VICI owns 10 trophy properties along the Las Vegas Strip, almost 700 acres of underlying land, more than 41,000 hotel rooms and nearly 6 million SF of convention and trade show space.\n\nAdditionally, the company owns just over 25 acres of undeveloped land behind Planet Hollywood and approximately 7 acres of strip frontage at Caesars Palace.\n\nVICI has a market cap of approximately $29.4 billion and a 127 million SF portfolio made up of 93 experiential assets, including 54 gaming properties and 39 other experiential properties.\n\nThe company\u2019s core gaming portfolio includes ~4.2 million SF of gaming space and features over 60,000 hotel rooms, roughly 500 retail outlets, and more than 500 bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.\n\nLast year, the company added to its core-gaming / casino properties when it acquired 38 family bowling entertainment centers from Bowlero. The acquired bowling properties total 1.6 million SF across 17 states and are expected to generate an initial annual cash rent of $31.6 million.\n\nIn addition to its gaming and other experiential properties, VICI owns 4 championship golf courses which are located in Indiana, Mississippi, and Nevada.\n\nIn total, VICI\u2019s portfolio includes 54 gaming and 39 other experiential properties across 26 U.S. states and 1 Canadian Province.\n\nVICI - IR\n\nVICI has a total of 13 tenants, including Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts, PENN Entertainment, Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, and Pure Casino. All of VICI\u2019s tenants are subject to triple net leases, 91% have parent guarantees, and 50% of its rent includes CPI-linked escalations which is expected to increase to 96% over the long term.\n\nThe company has a 100% occupancy rate and has collected 100% of its rent since its formation. VICI\u2019s top 2 tenants make up 74% of its annualized cash rent. VICI\u2019s largest tenant is Caesars Entertainment, which operates 18 properties, has a weighted average lease term (\u201cWALT\u201d) of 31.4 years, and accounts for 39% of VICI annual rent.\n\nVICI\u2019s second-largest tenant is MGM Resorts, which operates 13 properties, has a WALT of 51 years and accounts for 35% of annualized cash rent.\n\nIn total, when including all tenant extension options, VICI\u2019s portfolio has a WALT of 41.5 years.\n\nVICI - IR\n\nVICI has an investment grade balance sheet with a BBB- credit rating from S&P Global. The gaming REIT has solid debt metrics including a net leverage ratio of 5.4x, a long-term debt to capital ratio of 40.82%, and an EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.19x.\n\n83% of the company\u2019s debt is unsecured and 99% is fixed rate. VICI\u2019s debt maturities are well staggered with a weighted average term to maturity of 6.8 years and the company has plenty of dry powder with $1.2 billion of cash, equivalents, forward equity, and short-term investments.\n\nPlus, the company has $2.3 billion available to it under its credit revolver. In total, at the end of the first quarter, VICI reported total liquidity of $3.5 billion.\n\nVICI - IR\n\nIn its short history, VICI has delivered strong growth, with an average AFFO growth rate of 6.74% since 2019.\n\nAnalysts expect AFFO per share to increase by 5% in 2024, and then by 4% the following year. The company has delivered strong dividend growth as well, with an average dividend growth rate of 10.11% over the past 5 years.\n\nVICI pays a 5.84% dividend yield that is well covered with a 2023 AFFO payout ratio of 74.88%. The stock is currently trading at a P/AFFO of 12.93x, compared to its average AFFO multiple of 15.93x.\n\nWe rate VICI Properties a Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nIn Closing\n\nJust as Realty Income has balanced its exposure with Walgreen\u2019s, I\u2019m also keeping my portfolio diversified, limiting positions so that one torpedo doesn\u2019t blow up my REIT ship.\n\nI still own Medical Properties (MPW), but I have modest exposure, which has allowed me to ride out the storms. (I did sell some shares).\n\nMost of my REIT holdings are higher quality, like the one\u2019s referenced in this article. I do have over 5% exposure in Realty Income, Agree Realty, and VICI Properties, as I have utilized dollar cost averaging to reduce my basis.\n\nI believe that the next six months will be extremely opportunistic for REIT Investors, which is why you will be seeing me (and our team) triple down on our research.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading and commenting and have a great 4th of July week.\n\nHappy SWAN Investing!\n\nAuthor's note: Brad Thomas is a Wall Street writer, which means he's not always right with his predictions or recommendations.

        "title": "Mid-America Apartment Communities: The Upside Is Now Over 15% Annually (NYSE:MAA)",
        "body": "Dragon Claws\n\nDear subscribers,\n\nThis week, I wrote an article on Equity Residential, but my primary focus and the REIT I want you to focus on, unless you're already fully invested (like I am), is actually Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA). This is a REIT with an A-rating, sub-38% long-term debt/capital, and a yield that's almost 4.3%. Most of the quality apartment/multifamily REITs are currently seeing yields of around 4-4.5%, some just below, but overall they're more or less at the same specifics.\n\nMAA is like EQR as well as Camden (CPT) and is an A-rated solid multifamily REIT with a very solid portfolio and overall valuation upside - at the right price, which I believe we currently have.\n\nBecause I believe we have this price, I consider the company to be attractive here. This is one of the lowest-leverage REITs in the space, with a current 3.6x net debt to Adj. EBITDAre, and the company has returned a 10-year TSR of 10.2%, better than the market. Also, with 121 consecutive cash dividends since the IPO, the company has not failed to pay out to its shareholders.\n\nWith a current market cap of around $20B and over 102,000 units, the company is larger than some and not as large as others - but where it shines through is valuation upside and consistency.\n\nMid-America Apartments - Good returns since I started buying in fall of 2023\n\nIt was last year during October/November that I seriously started investing in MAA, pushing my stake above 1% for a few simple fundamental reasons, which can be gleaned here.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nAs I've said before, and unlike EQR, MAA doesn't have any West Coast exposure. This is one of the main advantages of the business - all of the markets are growth-oriented markets with very good fundamentals, and the high focus on so-called \"Garden style\" properties is another positive here.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nOut of the company's current balance sheet, there's over 77% common equity with the lion's share of debt unsecured. Only 1.8% of the current debt is subject to securitization, and less than 0.3% is preferred stock.\n\nThere are only eight REITs in the world that are public and have an A rating or above. MAA is one of them, and it has this rating for all three services. The company's maturities are very well-laddered with only one maturing this month, and the company has over $1B of combined cash and capacity available at this time. With a debt/preferred ratio of 22.8% of the total capital, it's no strange thing that the company is being viewed as positive as we're seeing here.\n\nMAA Is also incredibly stable. This is something we can see clearly confirmed here for the quarter as well, which we saw about a month ago with 1Q. Core FFO was in line with expectations - slightly down for 1Q, due to impacts from new supply deliveries in the company's markets. There's a busy summer season coming, and MAA is going into it with already-good occupancy levels.\n\nSame-store revenue grew by 1.4% - below peers, but still good, with a physical occupancy of above 95%, but below 96% - so note that EQR in many areas has been higher, if only slightly. Also, OpEx is increasing more rapidly for MAA than some others, with a 5.4% growth, and well above revenue increase, while the company's NOI is also decreasing slightly.\n\nResident turnover remains very low, but the other trends are currently not exactly favorable, reflecting also the company expectation of an AFFO decline of around 4% for this year, which will not rise back to previous 2023 levels until, at current forecasts, around 2026E.\n\nIt surprises me a little that MAA has not seen more negative trends because of this; instead, it has actually seen valuation slowly climb/increase despite this expected decline. I do not believe it is outside of the realm of possibility for the company to trade \"down\" from her, and given the forecasts, I would even view this as justified.\n\nIt becomes important when looking at MAA to consider these results In the context of a much longer-term picture.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nLook, I say, what Mid-America has actually managed to do for its investors. Market cycle is largely irrelevant if you look at the very long term. The company has a 30+ year tradition of creating value in the Sunbelt region, and MAA also has an in-house team and operations for creating value in new developments and properties.\n\nThe company's top markets remain places like Atlanta, Dallas, and Tampa, each of which are growing at non-trivial rates with very solid market fundamentals, in terms of employment, salaries, age, and the like.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nHowever, the company's main challenge remains the outlook for the full year at this time. Not only is revenue and rent growth expected to remain below 1% for the year, the physical occupancy is also not expected to reach 96%, and both expense and real estate tax growth rates are expected to be between 4%- 5.6%, with a midpoint closer to 5% for each, and a property NOI growth of negative 1.3%.\n\nIn short, it's not set to be an overly impressive year for the company here - but 2025E and beyond, that's when some of the positive trends are set to materialize here which could and should improve things. We're talking about platform initiatives, the impacts of repositioning some projects, more redevelopment, some new M&As, some lease-ups, and continued upside from the geography here.\n\nIt also pays off here to remember the current migration trends within the US, which I have been following since COVID-19.\n\nMAA IR (MAA IR)\n\nPlenty to like here about this for MAA - and this outperformance for these areas is set to continue on a forward basis. The company's projects have been put to market, including things like some Atlanta projects, Phoenix, Denver, Raleigh, and others - with pre-purchases available in many, and others coming online in early 2025E at the latest.\n\nThe company also moves forward with internal redevelopments and renovations, with updated kitchens, appliances, and new flooring. None of these things are where I would expect massive bottom-line improvements, this is more the company \"keeping up\" with the competition.\n\nOverall, Mid-America manages some very attractive assets with plenty of value-adds, including fitness centers, co-working areas, spas, and relaxation areas. I've said it before and I will say it again - if I were to take the step to live part-time in the US, it would be in one of these areas, and it would likely be in a unit either from Camden or from Mid-America. While in some comparisons they come across as expensive, they also offer flexibility and value which I, being of the target demography and income, find appealing.\n\n1Q24 and the rest of 2024 therefore, is something I expect to continue to be relatively flat, or even negative - and I expect the company to trade or trend down a bit as well - but over the long term, expect the company to improve and move up - leading to positive RoR for shareholders that invest today.\n\nHow high?\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nMid-America Valuation - A 15% annualized upside is still possible here\n\nWhat I've said before is mostly still true - in that even if you decide to forecast the company at only a 19-20x P/E, MAA continues to show a compelling upside. At a 7-10-year average, a 20x P/AFFO is not illogical or exuberant, especially when you consider that this company \"hits\" its targets 100% of the time with a 10% margin of error. The company still does this as well, which leads me to forecast the company at a range of around 20-21x P/AFFO.\n\nThe results you could get from the investment as it stands now is looking as follows.\n\nF.A.S.T graphs Upside Mid-America(F.A.S.T graphs Upside Mid-America)\n\nIs this sort of return likely?\n\nWell, based on the company's extensive history of \"hitting its targets\", I would characterize this as a likely development. Even if the company turns sour and doesn't hit that note of 19-20x, and only stays at 17-19x, you're still generating solid returns well above that of a savings account or a CD (Paywalled Link to F.A.S.T Graphs). So based on this, I would say that this company, even if it turns a bit sour from here, represents a very solid investment.\n\nRemember, I'm often not looking for massive, quadruple-digit returns. Far too many investors focus on what they \"can get\", when investing, when they should be focusing on what they could actually lose if the company turned sour. While a portion of my portfolio, about 10-15%, is allocated to riskier plays, the vast majority is invested in companies that strictly generate income and a solid, annualized rate of return while minimizing overall risk.\n\nThis is what MAA is for me - a very solid investment with very high safety.\n\nAnalysts would concur with this. We're currently at a share price of $137, and if you recall, I have a PT of $139. I'm not switching my PT here, which means the company's upside is almost gone here. The 20 analysts that follow the company have a range starting at $124/share and going up to $154/share, with an average of $139, an increase of $2/share since the last time I wrote which means the average is exactly on my current PT as well (Paywalled TIKR.com Link).\n\nHowever, most analysts despite this price target, are currently at a \"HOLD\". Almost 15 of them out of 20 do not consider the company a \"BUY\" here.\n\nI say that it's not as attractive as it once was, and it does have downside potential - but it's still a solid multifamily potential.\n\nIf pressed to pick the two most attractive REITs to invest in today, my answer would be Realty Income (O) and Agree (ADC). But many investors, especially here, are already at capacity with these investments - as am I. So I would say that MAA represents a good alternative if you're looking to invest money at a good dividend rate and potential upside.\n\nMy thesis for the company is as follows for June 2024 and for the coming 7 months.\n\nThesis\n\nMid-America Apartment Communities is, in this analyst's view, a sector-leading REIT with a very solid portfolio of good exposure to some of the most attractive apartment real estate in the USA.\n\nThe company offers a compelling upside both based on valuation and the potential of growth and stability with above-average operating and safety metrics.\n\nI give the company a share price of $139/share, under which I believe the 15% annualized is intact, even as of June 2024. You're in for a poor year, as I see it, but beyond 2025E, that's when we'll see some real upside in MAA. I believe it could pay off to invest at this time.\n\nRemember, I'm all about:\n\nBuying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.\n\nIf the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1.\n\nIf the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows.\n\nI reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.\n\nHere are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).\n\nThis company is overall qualitative.\n\nThis company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.\n\nThis company pays a well-covered dividend.\n\nThis company is currently cheap.\n\nThis company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.\n\nI can't call MAA \"cheap\" here, but I can call it \"qualitative\", and I do - as well as a \"BUY\".",

        "body": "Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.\n\nIt said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit\u2019s debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit\u2019s shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.\n\nBoeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners.\n\nIn 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit\u2019s revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing\u2019s main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.\n\nCEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \u201cfully align\u201d the companies\u2019 production systems and workforces.\n\n\u201cAmong the many actions we\u2019re taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\u201d Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.\n\nHe said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit\u2019s operators dedicated to Airbus planes.\n\nSpirit\u2019s CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.\n\nMounting pressure\n\nA preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board into the Jan. 5 accident said it appeared the bolts that hold the door plug in place weren\u2019t attached to the Max 9 when it left Boeing\u2019s factory and was handed over to Alaska Airlines months before the accident.\n\nThat was the most serious of a host of production problems on Boeing planes, which also included Spirit-made fuselages that had misdrilled holes and misconnected fuselage panels.\n\nThe crisis stemming from the door-plug blowout on the Alaska flight has slowed Boeing\u2019s deliveries of new planes to airlines, and has driven financial hits for both Spirit and Boeing. Boeing\u2019s CFO in May said the company would burn, rather than generate cash this year\u2014about $8 billion in the first half of 2024. Boeing\u2019s shares are down more than 30% this year.\n\nOne way Boeing has tried to improve quality is to accept only fuselages without defects so that repairs or additional manufacturing steps won\u2019t have to be made out of sequence, reducing the changes of errors.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has said it won\u2019t let Boeing expand production until it is satisfied with its production lines.\n\nCalhoun was skewered by lawmakers in a June Senate hearing over the company\u2019s safety record and what some Senators lamented was a lack of improvement in the wake of two deadly Max crashes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/boeing-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems.html",

        "body": "Pipeline and midstream energy stocks have had a strong start to 2024. This can been seen in the performance of major sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSEMKT: ENFR), up about 18% year to date, and the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP), up nearly 17%. The latter only includes the stocks of midstream companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs), while the former includes midstream companies structured as both MLPs and corporations.\n\nWhile the first half of the year has been a good one for the sector, there is strong reason to believe a number of stocks in the space could be set to outperform in the second half and beyond.\n\nLets look at three midstream stocks set to outperform the rest of this year and into the future.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMPLX\n\nMPLX (NYSE: MPLX) is a midstream company involved in logistics and storage as well as gathering and processing (G&P). Refiner Marathon Petroleum owns approximately 65% of the company and represents just under 50% of its revenue.\n\nThe stock sports an attractive 8% yield based on its most recent distribution and had a robust 1.6 times coverage ratio in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is in good shape with a leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) of just 3.2 times. The company has been a consistent performer, raising its base distribution each year since 2012.\n\nThe company is well positioned in both Appalachia (Marcellus and Utica) and the Permian, and has a robust pipeline of growth projects in both regions over the next few years. It is planning to spend $950 million in growth capital expenditure (capex) this year. The company also recently acquired some G&P assets in the Utica and entered into an agreement to merge the Whistler Pipeline and Rio Bravo Pipeline projects into a new joint venture in order to link Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, which it believes will lead to future growth opportunities. <\n\nSituated in the right basins, MPLX looks in good shape to continue growing its distributions, while its forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) valuation of 9.6 times (one of the most common ways to value midstream stocks) is attractive and well below the 13.7 times multiple the sector traded at between 2011 to 2016.\n\nMPLX EV to EBITDA (Forward) Chart\n\nMPLX EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nWestern Midstream\n\nOne of the best-performing midstream stocks in the first half of the year was Western Midstream (NYSE: WES), which was up around 35%. The company primarily services Occidental Petroleum's gathering and processing (G&P) needs in the Delaware Permian, Powder River Basin (PRB), and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basins.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company started the year strong, recording record Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $609 million that was up 22%, while its free cash flow soared 60% to $225 million. This prompted Western to say it expected its adjusted EBITDA to come in at the high end of its previous guidance calling for full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.\n\nImpressively, the company increased its quarterly distribution by 52% from $0.575 per unit to $0.875. Based on this distribution, the stock now yields about 8.9%. Western appears on track to reach its leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) goal of 3 times by year end, at which point it could pay out excess (special or variable) distributions above its current $0.875 quarterly based payout. That would likely help propel the stock even higher and set it up to continue to outperform.\n\nMeanwhile, with a forward EV-to-EBITDA valuation of 9.6 times, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation that is well below historical levels.\n\nWES EV to EBITDA (Forward) Chart\n\nWES EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nEnergy Transfer (ET)\n\nOne of the stocks best positioned to benefit from increasing power consumption stemming from artificial intelligence (AI), meanwhile, is Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET). The company has the largest integrated midstream system in the country with strong positions in low-cost natural gas-producing regions, particularly the Permian. As primarily a prolific oil-producing basin, the associated natural gas that comes from production in the Permian is some of the cheapest in the country, which is likely to draw many new data centers to the region given the immense energy that is needed to power AI.\n\nEnergy Transfer already has one of the most robust growth-project backlogs in the midstream space, with the company expecting to spend nearly $3 billion in growth capex this year. Projects related to AI energy consumption are only likely to increase that backlog in the future.\n\nAt the same time, the company has repaired its balance sheet to nicely lower its leverage, while carrying a high distribution-coverage ratio of over 2 times last quarter.\n\nTrading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of just 7.4 times, Energy Transfer is a cheap stock with a lot of potential growth in front of it. That's why it is my favorite midstream stock to outperform in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\n\nET EV to EBITDA (Forward) Chart\n\nET EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Energy Transfer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Energy Transfer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Looking for a Home-Run Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investment? Consider This AI Stock That Nvidia Is Investing In.",
        "body": "Hitting a home run in investing can be very satisfying as the returns can be incredible. But alongside home runs come strikeouts, and when you're an all-or-nothing style of investor, strikeouts happen a lot more than home runs. Still, if the overall returns make up for the massive losses, this can be a worthy investment strategy for those with the right stamina.\n\nThese days, some investors might be looking for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks with this home-run potential, and I think I've pinpointed one. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has the makings for a potential home-run investment and is also backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). There's no better partner in the AI space.\n\nLet's see what could make SoundHound a top choice for those swinging for the fences.\n\nIts audio recognition technology is thriving in two fields\n\nSoundHound AI integrates AI with audio recognition. While this has multiple applications, two fields where SoundHound has made the biggest impact are restaurants and automobiles. For restaurants, SoundHound has been automating drive-thru windows and taking orders by phone. Margins in the restaurant business are notoriously slim, so if a restaurant can reduce headcount by using AI at a cheaper cost, it will.\n\nSoundHound's audio recognition technology is being integrated into digital assistants in the automotive industry. Hands-free technology has been around for over a decade, but it's clunky technology that doesn't always work right. SoundHound fixes this problem and integrates generative AI technology with its product by utilizing ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, this requires internet connectivity to function properly, so Nvidia and SoundHound teamed up to embed a large language model onto an onboard GPU that allows this model to function regardless of where the vehicle is located.\n\nOverall, SoundHound offers a great value proposition for customers. However, there are some concerns about the company's financials.\n\nSoundHound is burning a lot of cash\n\nIn the first quarter, SoundHound's revenue increased 73% year over year to $11.6 million. While that's an impressive headline figure, $11.6 million isn't a lot of revenue compared to most companies.\n\nThe issue with SoundHound's financials is its burn rate, as the company is highly unprofitable. Even though it generated $11.6 million in revenue, it posted a $28.5 million operating loss, which means it's spending about 4 times as much money as it's bringing in. That's an unsustainable model, but it should be expected for a company still in the early innings of deploying its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound's saving grace is its massive backlog. This metric sums up all of the bookings it has in the future, which isn't a guarantee of revenue. But it paints a picture of the potential demand. If SoundHound converts its $682 million backlog into true revenue, it will have achieved massive success.\n\nWith such a large backlog, SoundHound should have no issue raising additional funds by issuing shares on the public market, allowing it to sustain its unprofitable habits.\n\nBut does all of this add up to a stock worth taking a swing at? Although the stock used to trade for a much higher valuation during the initial AI hype cycle at the start of the year, 20 times sales is still expensive for the stock of a company that still has a lot of work to do before it's viable.\n\nSOUN PS Ratio Chart\n\nI still think there's enough of an investment here to take a shot at SoundHound, but anyone who buys the stock must be prepared to watch their investment go to zero. If you have that ability, then it's a stock worth considering, as it does have a lot of potential. But remember to keep position sizing very small, as a total loss is a possibility.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "One thing you can say about Cathie Wood is that she's persistent. The aggressive growth investor who's also the co-founder, CEO, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest enjoys swinging the fences. She's also not afraid to go for the safe single, binge-buying some of her favorite holdings over and over again.\n\nShe publishes Ark Invest's transactions at the end of every market day. Something out of the ordinary happened on Friday night, as she announced her purchases from earlier in the day. PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) was one of the six existing positions that she added to on Friday. More importantly, she bought shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions every single trading day in June. She obviously likes PagerDuty right now. Should you? Let's take a closer look.\n\nReporting for duty\n\nEnterprise software companies are all about making businesses more efficient, and that's what PagerDuty's growing suite of offerings aims to accomplish. From automation tools that help increase task completion speeds and lower support costs to its incident management platform that allows clients to navigate through hiccups and come out of disruptions even smarter, PagerDuty's ambitious isn't on trial.\n\nGrowth has been the problem, particularly given its recent run of slowing top-line gains. Year-over-year revenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive financial reports, from a starting point of 34% down to just 8% nearly two years later.\n\nQ2 2023: 34%\n\nQ3 2023: 31%\n\nQ4 2023: 29%\n\nQ1 2024: 21%\n\nQ2 2024: 19%\n\nQ3 2024: 15%\n\nQ4 2024: 10%\n\nQ1 2025: 8%\n\nPagerDuty's dollar-based net retention rate has disintegrated from 116% to 106% over the past year, and its paid customers count has stalled around 15,100 in that time. The bottom line has also been problematic. It has never turned a profit on a reported basis, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. It did announce a small round of layoffs earlier this year, but it remains to be seen if the cost controls will pay off without sacrificing a potential return to top-line growth.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nKnocking on Wood\n\nCathie Wood naturally has a more upbeat read on PagerDuty than the downward sloping fundamentals. She has been buying a piece of PagerDuty every trading day since May 31. Despite the recent daily trickle of purchases, it remains one of the smallest positions across the combined holdings of Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds.\n\nShe's not the only one who was buying. Shares of PagerDuty soared 21% last month.\n\nThere are some reasons to be upbeat about PagerDuty's near-term prospects. For starters, despite the single-digit revenue growth that PagerDuty posted in its latest quarter, Wall Street pros see it returning to double-digit revenue gains for the entire fiscal year and accelerating in each of the next two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nProfitability on an adjusted basis is also expected to climb 14% next year and another 24% in fiscal 2027. This prices PagerDuty stock at 23 times that fiscal year's adjusted earnings, but it has also posted double-digit percentage beats in each of the past four reports.\n\nThe naysayers are still plentiful, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nearly 12% of PagerDuty's shares are currently being sold short, approaching the all-time high it notched earlier this year. In the right environment, even a modest bullish catalyst can send the boo-birds scrambling for cover, and the short squeeze would theoretically push the stock higher.\n\nSentiment could be turning after a buoyant June. Chad Bennett at Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock last week, rallying around the potential for revenue gains to accelerate after bottoming out in the fiscal first quarter. His new $30 price target implies another 31% of upside in the shares. A reignited PagerDuty should result in either the resumption of customer growth or a reversal in the retreat of its dollar-based net retention rate. In an ideal world it would be a little bit of both leading the charge, and PagerDuty reaching reported profitability sooner than expected. For now, a once out-of-favor software-as-a-service company -- or SaaS stock -- is starting to court believers. Wood seems to have the right idea when it comes to buying PagerDuty this summer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PagerDuty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PagerDuty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PagerDuty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Survey Monday\n\nWelcome to the first trading session of the second half of the year! The benchmark S&P 500 Index (SP500) has returned an impressive 14.5% so far in 2024, boosted by the YTD gains of top performers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) +188%, Nvidia (NVDA) +149%, Vistra Corp. (VST) +123%, and Constellation Energy (CEG) +71%. What will be the best-performing S&P 500 stock in H2?\n\n\n\nTake the survey here and don't forget to share your thoughts in the WSB comments section.\n\nDe La France\n\nInternational headlines are coming out of France this morning after Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella's National Rally scored a victory in the first round of legislative elections. The party and its allies were projected to have won 33% of the vote, compared to the 29% of the New Popular Front coalition and a distant third-place finish for President Macron's Renaissance party at 22%. Macron previously called the snap elections after getting trounced in EU parliamentary elections a month ago, but the gamble on a moment of \"clarification\" seems to have backfired.\n\n\n\nMarket moves: French stocks soared at the open, with the blue-chip CAC 40 Index advancing nearly 3% in early trade. Some analysts attributed the move to the likelihood of a hung parliament, and a sense of gridlock certainty that will be enjoyed by the market, while others highlighted the potential for growth under National Rally, which has pitched lowering income tax and VAT on energy and fuel. The euro also climbed 0.5% against the dollar to $1.077, while the yield on the French 10-year government bond rose 4 basis points to 3.33%.\n\n\n\nA second round of voting will take place on July 7 and will determine whether National Rally will get an absolute majority. Much political jockeying will take place before then and will likely include the withdrawal of many third-placed candidates, who won at least 12.5% of total registered voters. Macron's base will specifically look to prevent a power-sharing arrangement with the National Rally, which has been repositioned and rebranded under Marine Le Pen and severed its controversial ties to her divisive father (who founded the party in 1972).\n\n\n\nThought bubble: While many media outlets currently use adjectives like the far-right, many French voters believe the opposite - mirroring a stance seen across Europe and even the U.S. They feel that the values now embraced by the so-called centrist parties embody the extremes previously seen on the periphery of the political spectrum, such as open immigration and asylum (European migrant crisis), top-heavy mandates and regulation (COVID pandemic), and military interventionism (sending troops to Ukraine). These voters are also discontent with personalities that seem to leave certain demographics behind (farmer protests) and politicians that are disconnected from the realities of the common man or woman (Yellow Vest protests). The outlook can become even more emboldened when unbridled pluralism is preached over a proud national identity, or in response to entities that refer to these feelings as populist anger, fringe stances and Euroscepticism. (12 comments)\n\nMerger Monday\n\nBoeing (BA) agreed to acquire Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) for $37.25 a share in a $4.7B all-stock deal that will give the plane maker more control over its supply chain amid ongoing safety issues. The deal would effectively reverse Boeing's spinoff of Spirit in 2005, which was aimed at cutting costs by outsourcing the assembly of fuselages and other parts. Rival Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) will also buy some Spirit Aero assets to support the European company's programs. Elsewhere, the DOJ is urging Boeing to plead guilty to a criminal charge after finding that the planemaker violated a settlement over its fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. (21 comments)\n\nSurveillance network\n\nFedEx (FDX) is said to be sharing surveillance feeds with local law enforcement as part of an AI car surveillance network. The feeds are from AI-powered cameras made by Flock Safety, which has a presence in 4,000 cities across over 40 states, according to Forbes. Flock has similar arrangements with other multi-billion dollar companies, including Simon Property Group (SPG) and Lowe's (LOW), which share mall feeds with local cops to combat shoplifting. Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest health insurers in the U.S., has also shared data with Flock's license plate readers for intelligence support. (8 comments)\n\nNuclear AI\n\nAmid surging demand for electricity to power AI data centers, the tech industry is moving to secure a steady supply through nuclear power plants. The latest in the spotlight is a reported potential deal between Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Constellation Energy (CEG). Vistra (VST) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG) have also held talks for 'behind-the-meter' deals, where a large customer gets electricity directly from a plant. While the renewed interest in nuclear power bodes well for the industry, the deals could divert existing electricity resources, strain the power grid, and impact targets for reducing emissions. Take the WSB survey. (6 comments)",

The debtors will continue to operate their businesses as a debtor-in-possession and pursue a structured sale of their assets pursuant to one or more competitive bidding processes or other strategic arrangements involving such assets. The debtors are also seeking approval of \"first day\" motions containing customary relief intended to enable the debtors to continue their ordinary course operations during the Chapter 11 cases.\n\nDelta Apparel's (NYSE:DLA) roots can be traced back to the early 1990s, when it emerged as a subsidiary of Delta Woodside Industries, a textile manufacturing company. In the early years, Delta Apparel focused on producing basic activewear and casual apparel. Over time, the company expanded its product offerings and distribution channels. A significant milestone was the acquisition of the Duck Head brand in the early 1990s, which helped boost Delta's apparel sales and profits. The company also invested in modernizing its manufacturing facilities, such as opening a new ultramodern yarn plant in Edgefield, South Carolina, in 1992. The company went public in June 2000. Since then, Delta Apparel (DLA) has evolved into a vertically integrated, international apparel company focused on the design, manufacturing, sourcing, and marketing of a diverse portfolio of activewear and lifestyle apparel products.

        "body": "During the pandemic, an exodus of professionals left their urban jungle flats for sprawling suburban homes in more scenic rural areas\u2014and now despite cities bouncing back and offices reopening, they\u2019d rather commute for hours on end on a train (or plane) than give up their newfound life on the outskirts.\n\nNew research by Trainline shows that the number of people in the U.K. spending more than 3 hours getting to work and back\u2014otherwise known as, \u201csuper commuting\u201d\u2014has doubled since before the pandemic.\n\nAlthough super commuters are defined as those with journeys to work of least 90 minutes one-way, the train ticket platform found that most actually spend at least 2 hours traveling in each direction.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, most super commuters aren\u2019t those lucky few who only have to show face in the office once in a blue moon.\n\nMost professionals who moved far from the office during the pandemic say they have hybrid working to thank (or blame) for their new commuting habit and for being able to keep their after-work country lifestyle.\n\nOn average, super commuters are heading into the office three days a week and as a result, wasting at least 12 hours\u2014more than an entire work day\u2014on a train each week, just to sit at their desks.\n\nYet despite having less time to actually enjoy their suburban life than those living close to the office, three-quarters of super commuters said they are happier for it, and over a third reported enjoying a better work-life balance.\n\nOthers admitted that the hefty journey is worth it for their reduced cost of living on the outskirts.\n\nSuper commuting is a global phenomenon\n\nSuper commuting isn\u2019t a U.K.-specific trend. Across the pond in the States, the mean distance to work rose from 10 miles in 2019 to 27 miles at the end of 2023, according to a study from payroll processing and HR services company Gusto.\n\nAccording to their data, millennials\u2014who are mostly in their thirties and settling down\u2014live the farthest away from their employer.\n\nTake hairstylist Katlin Jay: The 30-year-old travels 650 miles on a plane from Charlotte, N.C. to New York on a biweekly basis.\n\nBut, she told New York Post that she is paying less money on travel (at around $1,000 a month) than she would on rent if she lived near her Upper West side job.\n\nMeanwhile, even in Germany, a 32-year-old director is flying across the continent to London for work to get the best of both worlds. However, to those enticed by Seb\u2019s way of life, he warned in Business Insider that the 5-hour commute won\u2019t be sustainable in the long run.\n\nBut be warned: You may be asked to move back\n\nEven now that it\u2019s clear most companies will require their workers in the office for part of the week\u2014and having undoubtedly heard their colleagues complain about their long commute\u2014Trainline\u2019s research found that over half of city-living workers are eyeing up the super commute club.\n\nWhy? Just like current super commuters, most think it\u2019ll improve their work-life balance.\n\n\u201cHybrid working has helped fundamentally shift work and travel habits over the past few years, with more people now choosing a longer commute so they can both live and work where they want,\u201d Sakshi Anand, VP of growth at Trainline, said.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that not only are these rail super commuters on the rise, but that the phenomenon is here to stay.\u201d\n\nBut beware: Bosses could ask you to choose between the office or your life on the outskirts.\n\nJust last week, Patagonia told its remote customer service employees that they must now live within 60 miles of one of seven \u201chubs\u201d in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Reno, Dallas, Austin, Chicago, or Pittsburgh.\n\nThe sustainable outdoors brand gave around 90 workers the ultimatum: relocate or quit.\n\nLikewise, last year TikTok warned U.S. workers whose home addresses aren\u2019t in the vicinity of its office, that they could lose their jobs if they don\u2019t relocate.",

        "body": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta has breached the EU\u2019s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission.\n\nMeta launched a \u201cpay or consent\u201d model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc\u2019s data privacy rules, under which users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes. Users who do not pay consent, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, said the model did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into \u201cpay or consent\u201d on Monday and found the model \u201cforces users to consent\u201d to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the \u201cwith adverts\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.\n\n\u201cIn the commission\u2019s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks,\u201d it said.\n\nIt said in order to comply with the DMA, Meta must launch \u201cequivalent\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram that use less of people\u2019s data.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the new model had been designed to comply the DMA and other regulatory demands.\n\n\u201cSubscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed subscription for no ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the commission,\u201d they said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "YMAX ETF: Striking A Balance Between High Yields And Risk Management (NYSEARCA:YMAX)",
        "body": "JimVallee\n\nIn February, I published an article on YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) concluding that while the fund's performance was notable, the risks of single issued stock investments, further convoluted by options trading, made investing into the fund too risky for my investment style. I thought a more risk managed way to own something like NVDY was to own YieldMax Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs (YMAG) or the YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:YMAX), which both contain NVDY. This article will cover YMAX. While the fund and it's underlying holdings have performed well, I believe more time is needed to test the fund's strategy against different market conditions.\n\nFund Holdings & Strategy\n\nIncepted on January 15, 2024 and based in the U.S. with $256M AUM (assets under management), YMAX currently has a TTM yield of 16.38% and pays distributions monthly. The fund seeks income generation with a portion of the gains coming from call options strategies on the underlying holdings, in this case the suite of YieldMax ETFs, making the YMAX ETF a \"fund of funds\".\n\nYMAX Holdings (Seeking Alpha)\n\nWithin the underlying holdings are primarily call options contracts and settled cash allocated to short-term treasury investments. The call options contract's strike price and date are made transparent to investors. The fund managers use two different covered call options strategies:\n\nTraditional covered calls, where the fund sells a call option on an underlying security it owns. Synthetic covered call strategy, where the fund sells a call option on an underlying security it does not own. The fund will buy and sell the underlying holdings call and put options respectively at the same time to replicate the price movements of the underlying stock in spans of 6 months to 1 year.\n\nOf note, the fund's TTM dividend yield of 16.38% is still growing and has not yet stabilized while the fund's yield on cost has remained relatively stable. Given the volatile nature of income investing options strategies, investors should not necessarily expect the funds yield to be stable as it will fluctuate along with the volitility of the underlying holdings.\n\nYMAX Yield (Seeking Alpha)\n\nYMAX YOC (Seeking Alpha)\n\nYMAX Performance Study\n\nSince the inception of YMAX, the fund has been keeping pace and at times even outpacing the the total return of the S&P 500, returning 14.58% vs. 15.96% respectively. Most of the returns of YMAX comes from the income distribution from the options strategy rather than the price return which has declined about 2% while the S&P 500 has run up over 15% YTD. From an income perspective, the fund is impressive thus far. While the returns of the market and YMAX are similar, a key difference are the majority of the returns of the S&P 500 are based on price return or \"paper gains\" while YMAX has are based on yield return. The fund has distributed a real cash return to shareholders which is an important characteristic when evaluating income generation of your investments. Of note, the beta of YMAX is about 1.75 vs. 1.00 for the S&P 500 benchmark, thus investors are taking on significantly more risk to get returns from YMAX.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSince YMAX is a \"fund of funds\" of the YieldMax family, I thought it would be interesting to plot each ETF's total returns based on the timeframe you could have owned one of them vs. YMAX. Several funds have returned more than 20% during this time, with YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) and YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) returning a staggering 82.6% and 79.8% respectively in the last ~6 months! Also, it's encouraging to see most funds generated a positive return and the four that did not had losses less than 15%, not something like 30, 40, or 50%. For YMAX, each holding carries around a 5% weight in the fund.\n\nYMAX Holdings Total Return Since YMAX Inception (Seeking Alpha, Nicholas Bratto)\n\nI thought it would also be interesting to plot each YMAX holding since their own inception dates to get a better idea of how something like YMAX could play out long-term. The data shows a similar trend, with more time lending to increased returns on the funds holding's total returns. However, one data point, and it only takes one, exemplifies why dazzling 20%+ returns should be cautioned when we see things like YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY) returning -22.7%.\n\nYMAX Holdings Total Return Since Their Inception (Seeking Alpha, Nicholas Bratto)\n\nIf an investor is trying to assess each ETF's underlying price movements and hand pick them, even if 3 of them return 10%+, it only takes one -20%+ loss to wipe out all the gains. Or worse, just picking one ETF hoping to achieve an 80% return only to lose 20% of your money! The case for YMAX is really about seeing if the yield and the NAV are sustainable by holding the entire portfolio of their strategy to reduce the risk of NAV erosion. Based on the performance thus far, I would say it's doing a good job at that.\n\nOutlook\n\nThough I like how YMAX and it's underlying holdings have performed, I still rate this ETF as a \"Hold\" as I don't feel the strategy has had enough exposure to father time. The underlying holdings have only been exposed to the market's bull run since mid-2023. Seeing how the fund performs in market downturns or flat markets would give me more confidence in the sustainability of the total returns. Ultimately, I'm looking for this fund to return 8%+ sustainably for it to be considered an add to my portfolio or recommend it as a Buy. The fund carries a lot more risk and volatility in than funds targeting a 1% payout like Neos S&P 500(R) High Income ETF (SPYI) or NEOS NASDAQ-100(R) High Income ETF (QQQI), both of which I've also written on. For investors that already own or want to buy this fund, I recommend you reinvest a portion of the dividend. For example, pay yourself an 8% yield and reinvest the rest. This will prevent NAV erosion and grow your income stream long-term.",

        "title": "Procter & Gamble: Stable And Growing Business, Slightly Overvalued (NYSE:PG)",
        "body": "bluekite\n\nDear readers,\n\nI recently shared my latest market outlook in an article on the S&P 500 (SPX) and explained why I continue to be bullish in the short term. In short, it's due to a combination of (1) inflation which is very likely to decline in the second half of the year as we work through the lag in shelter and auto insurance CPI, (2) consequently larger than expected Fed rate cuts, and (3) a likely liquidity boost around the election which, among other things, should come from (forced) lower QT by the Fed the draining of Janet Yellen's the treasury account.\n\nI'm staying invested in the S&P 500, but I am also aware of several long-term risks that the broader market index faces. The S&P 500 is very concentrated to only a handful of very large companies, mostly from the tech sector. This, historically speaking, tends to result in poor performance, as in a competitive market companies rarely manage to keep the competitive advantages (in terms of growth and margins) that got them to that top position in the first place.\n\nBroyhill research\n\nMoreover, the index is currently on the expensive side with an average forward P/E of 20.5x, way above the 15x which is generally regarded as fairly valued and in line with recent history.\n\nAll and all I do think that having a part of your portfolio exposed to the S&P 500 is not a bad idea, but given the long-term risks I like to allocate an equally large part to more defensive stocks. These include undervalued value stocks with a large margin of safety, but also proven blue chip staple companies that have kept on paying and increasing their dividends for decades.\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is an example of such a company.\n\nLast time I covered the stock was back in September. I concluded that the company had strong pricing power, which was an important factor back when the forward path of inflation seemed much less certain than now. But at a (somewhat) stretched valuation of 24.4x forward earnings which didn't leave much room for upside I issued a HOLD rating at $155 per share. Since then I have watched the stock return an RoR of 8.8% since, slightly above my forecasted annual total return of 6.5%. But the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 which returned a staggering 22.8% over the past 9 months.\n\nDavid Ksir\n\nIs PG a great business at a fair price?\n\nWarren Buffet is knows for saying that he much prefers buying great businesses at a fair price than decent businesses at a great price. And I think that PG fits this very well.\n\nFirst, let's go through what, in my opinion, makes Procter & Gamble a great business.\n\nThe company owns many very well known and recognized brands in beauty, grooming, home care and healthcare. These include brands such as Gillette, Old Spice, Oral B, and Pampers. The one thing that these brands have in common in that you need their products for your everyday life and you will likely buy them no matter the price. This is what gives the company fairly large pricing power and what has contributed to most of the organic sales growth, especially in inflationary periods.\n\nFiscal 2023, which covers the period from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023, was great for the company with 7% organic sales growth. Note that pricing contributed a full 9% to that growth, while mix contributed 1% and volume declined by 3%. This, of course, was largely driven by inflation and as inflation has come down significantly, it makes sense that PG's organic growth would come down as well. During the two most recent quarters, fiscal Q2 and Q3 2024, the company saw lower organic sales growth of 3-4%, led by the grooming segment which was the only segment that recorded double-digit growth.\n\nPG IR\n\nBut what the company lost in revenue growth it made for in operational efficiencies as, excluding the effect of FX, PG's core gross margin increased by 400 basis points during the most recent quarter.\n\nPG IR\n\nWith only one quarter left in the full fiscal year 2024 (to be reported on July 30th) and it is quite likely that the company will deliver on the 4-5% organic growth guidance which was issued back in September and which should translate into 10-11% growth in core EPS.\n\nPG IR\n\nAnd there are reasons to be positive beyond the fiscal 2024, with current consensus calling for annual EPS growth of 6-7% over the next two years driven by pricing, volume returning to normalized levels and a slowly (but surely) increasing market share.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWe could talk about the details all day, but the fact is that PG runs of the safest businesses in the world. And the word safe goes beyond their AA- balance sheet rating. They own the brands that you love and sell the products that need. That provides a significant moat. Moreover, they have proven to be very shareholder-friendly with 67 years of consecutive dividend increases and a strong share buyback program.\n\nThere is little doubt in my mind that PG's business will continue to thrive. The stock currently currently yields 2.44%. And we can reasonably expect the dividend to continue to grow in line with core EPS at 6-7% over the next couple of years. On top of the dividend, investors capture the aforementioned 6-7% core EPS growth, which already puts the investment around the 8% return threshold. The only thing left to do is to make sure that we don't overpay.\n\nThe stock trades at 25.2x earnings which isn't cheap, but frankly high quality never is. The 10-year long-term average for PG hovers closer to 22x which would indicate slight overvaluation. But the thing is that PG hasn't really been undervalued since 2018 when it traded at 18x earnings. Even during the Covid crash the stock only fell to 20x earnings very briefly and quickly recovered.\n\nFast Graphs\n\nPersonally, I think that valuing the stock at its 10-year historical average of 22x earnings makes sense. With expected 2024e earnings per share of $6.55, this corresponds to a price target of roughly $145 per share.\n\nRisks\n\nProcter & Gamble is a low volatility stock with a beta of just 0.57. As such, it is likely to experience lower highs and higher lows than the broader market.\n\nMy HOLD thesis, which in this case means simply staying away from the stock, has an opportunity cost. In particular, if the stock doesn't pull back, investors could easily be left behind as the stock continues on its nearly linear trajectory up and to the right. But since few stocks ever move in a straight line, I think that the risk is well worth it, especially for investors that (like me) are already mostly invested in the market and their cash is limited.\n\nOn a similar note, staying out has the obvious benefit of not participating in potential losses which PG will not be immune in case of a major market sell-off triggered by a black swan event.\n\nBottom Line\n\nProctor & Gamble is a great business at a fair price.\n\nThe stock is very likely to provide a total annual return of around 8%, while continuing to increase its now roughly 2.5% dividend yield. The current valuation is slightly on the expensive side, but anyone waiting for PG to pull back significantly will likely have to wait for a long time. I think, however, that waiting for a slight pull-back towards the 200-day moving average can be a smart move. I would only consider PG a BUY below $150 per share at which point it will be valued in line with historical average multiples and provide a reasonable margin of safety.\n\nFor these reasons I reiterate my HOLD rating here at $165 per share.",

        "title": "Celsius: A High-Risk, High-Reward Investment In The Energy Drink Market (NASDAQ:CELH)",
        "body": "HandmadePictures\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) presents a compelling investment opportunity in the burgeoning functional energy drink market. With innovative products and a robust distribution partnership with PepsiCo (PEP), Celsius is well-positioned for significant growth both in the U.S. and especially internationally. I believe that despite some recent sales slowdowns, the company's strategic expansions and strong financial health provide a solid foundation for future gains. Due to the recent share price decline of approximately 40%, the company could provide a fair risk-reward trade-off for a bit more risk-taking investor.\n\nA short introduction to the company\n\nCelsius Holdings is a rapidly growing company in the functional energy drink market, both in the U.S. and internationally. Celsius develops and distributes functional energy drinks with innovative, clinically proven formulas. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, caters to active lifestyles and is available in ready-to-drink and powder forms. The company also offers CELSIUS Essentials in 16-ounce cans.\n\nCELH sales by region (Quarterly Report)\n\nCelsius products are sold across various major U.S. retail channels, and international sales began in 2023. In 2022, Celsius entered a significant distribution agreement with PepsiCo, making Pepsi its primary distributor in the U.S. and involving a $550 million investment from PEP. The lion's share of its wholesale customers is made of two companies: Pepsi and Costco.\n\nCELH revenue (Quarterly Report)\n\nFuture trends of the energy drink market\n\nThe energy drink market in 2024 is shaped by four key trends: health and wellness, innovation, channel dynamics, and instant hydration. Health-conscious consumers increasingly seek high-caffeine, low-sugar, and functional beverages. According to NielsenIQ, \"health-conscious consumers are driving demand for energy drinks with functional benefits\". Celsius aligns with this trend by offering clinically proven, innovative formulas designed to support active lifestyles. Innovation remains crucial, with new product launches featuring unique ingredients and functional claims. Celsius capitalizes on this by continuously introducing new flavors and product lines, such as the CELSIUS Essentials line.\n\nChannel dynamics are also important, with different sales channels showing varying growth rates and consumer behaviors, affecting marketing strategies. Celsius' strategic distribution through major retail channels and online platforms ensures broad consumer reach. Additionally, the rising competition from instant hydration products pushes energy drink brands to differentiate through targeted marketing and unique value propositions.\n\nBy focusing on health benefits, continuous innovation, strategic distribution, and effective marketing, in my opinion, Celsius is well-positioned to leverage these market trends and drive growth in the competitive energy drink industry not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.\n\nReality check of Q1 management expectations\n\nFor the rest of 2024, Celsius Holdings' management is optimistic about the company's growth trajectory and market expansion. In the company's Q1 earnings call, they expected significant gains from the ongoing shelf resets, which are projected to be fully completed by July, aiming to achieve double and triple facings in stores. This initiative is anticipated to enhance product visibility and availability, thereby boosting sales. However, recent developments indicate that the company's sales growth has slowed, with Nielsen data showing a dip in market share to 10.5% and a pricing decrease of 7.2% year-over-year.\n\nIn my view, the partnership with Pepsi is a critical element in their strategy, with a new incentive program designed to align both companies' priorities and drive Celsius toward becoming the top energy drink brand globally. Yet, Pepsi's inventory reductions in Q2, amounting to $20-30 million, have led analysts to lower their revenue estimates for Celsius, impacting near-term outlooks. However, I also believe that the long-term growth prospect of the company is still in line with my expectations (25-28% CAGR for the next 4-5 years) but many analysts initially expected a higher growth rate of 30-34% in 2025 and 2026 which seems a bit high after the recent developments.\n\nInnovative product launches, such as new flavors and the CELSIUS Essentials line, are expected to continue driving category growth and attracting new consumers. John Fieldly - Chairman and CEO also highlighted the importance of their increased sales staff and key accounts team:\n\n\"And already this year, we've increased our sales and key accounts team by approximately 85%. By the end of this year, we're expecting to have three times as many sales staff compared to this time last year, supporting our growth and the opportunities we see ahead.\"\n\nInternational growth remains a focus, with promising performance in new markets like Canada, Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK. In addition, with the French market, they will get access to the whole EU market with more than 400 million consumers. The European energy drink market is expected to grow at around 7% per year for the next 5 years, which Celsius can capitalize on.\n\nFinancially, they aim to maintain high gross margins by leveraging supply chain efficiencies and controlling costs, despite fluctuations in raw material prices. However, analysts have adjusted their estimates due to inventory issues and market challenges, with some cautioning that future market share gains will be harder to achieve. Overall, while management remained confident in the first quarter earnings call in achieving robust revenue growth and market share gains through strategic initiatives and partnerships, recent trends suggest a need for cautious optimism as they navigate these challenges.\n\nInternational growth story\n\nCelsius Holdings is aggressively expanding internationally, aiming to enter the UK, Ireland, France, Australia, and New Zealand by the end of the year, alongside its recent launch in Canada.\n\nCELH international growth (Investor Presentation)\n\nThis expansion strategy, despite its association with PepsiCo, involves partnerships with regional distributors like Suntory Beverage in the UK due to its strong presence in gyms, a key entry point for energy drinks. This international push is expected to pressure margins due to the lack of established scale and manufacturing infrastructure outside the U.S., leading to higher costs and investments. I realistically expect that the highest gross margin to date (51.2%) which investors saw in Q1 will decline below 50% in the next quarters. However, the company benefits from higher-than-anticipated brand awareness, boosted by social media. CEO John Fieldly emphasized a methodical approach to international growth, replicating their successful U.S. strategy. PepsiCo serves as the exclusive distributor in Canada, while Suntory Beverage handles distribution in the UK and Ireland.\n\nValuation\n\nCelsius Holdings' valuation underscores its dynamic growth potential but also highlights the market's volatility and associated risks. In my opinion, the main risk factor for the company is its growth prospects because the market is counting on aggressive growth within the upcoming years. Although, in the last month, these slowing growth expectations have been reflected in its stock price. I expect that CELH can reach a market cap of $32-33 billion, reflecting a roughly 14% IRR based on a 25% CAGR over the next five years. Celsius trades at quite a high TTM P/E ratio of 62.8x and forward P/E of 52.8x, which are significantly above Monster's 31.6x and 28.1x, respectively. This disparity suggests a potential overvaluation, albeit justified by Celsius' rapid revenue growth of ~37% in the last quarter, outpacing Monster's ~14%.\n\nCELH revenue estimates according to the author (Alpha Spread)\n\nI believe that the company's financial robustness, marked by substantial cash reserves of $880 million and zero debt, provides a solid foundation for its growth initiatives. Moreover, its FCF generation of ~$130 million (last quarter) and high gross margins enhance its financial health. However, we need to take into consideration the near-term challenges from inventory adjustments by PEP and a softening demand across the energy drink category.\n\nDespite these hurdles, the long-term growth trajectory for Celsius remains promising to me, driven by innovative product launches and strategic market expansions. Analysts project a potential upside with a long-term average price target of $83.43, suggesting significant growth if the company continues to capitalize on its market opportunities and manage its valuation expectations effectively. Thus, while Celsius' valuation appears steep, its growth potential and financial strength position it as an attractive, but risky growth investment.\n\nOther factors to consider before buying in\n\nLet's recall that PepsiCo acquired an 8.5% stake in Celsius Holdings in 2022 at an adjusted price of $25 per share. Given Celsius' growing popularity and potential in international markets, PepsiCo might consider additional investments at around $50 per share. This move could bolster PepsiCo's portfolio, especially as it struggles with organic growth in its North American beverage portfolio. CELH remains a fast-growing, significant brand within PepsiCo's distribution network, potentially making it a future acquisition target. With CELH's market cap just under $14 billion compared to PepsiCo's $225 billion, a takeover remains plausible, especially if CELH's valuation compresses amid PepsiCo's muted growth in North America. Of course, at the moment it is pure speculation, but I believe a good investor tries to cover all the angles. One more interesting part is that after CELH's significant share price drop, the short interest has started to decrease. Short interest on CELH stands at 8.6% of the total float, which is lower than it stood in March (10.6%) or the beginning of June (9.2%).\n\nSummary\n\nIn conclusion, while Celsius Holdings faces near-term challenges including inventory adjustments and a competitive market landscape, its long-term growth potential remains robust. The company's innovative product lineup, strategic partnership with PepsiCo, and aggressive international expansion position it well to capitalize on the growing functional energy drink market. Financially strong with significant cash reserves and no debt, Celsius is equipped to navigate market fluctuations and pursue strategic initiatives. Although, the current valuation could seem high if we only take into account the company's current status, the potential for substantial revenue growth and potential strategic acquisition by PepsiCo provide a compelling investment case in my opinion.",

        "title": "FS KKR: Fat 14% Yield Offers Significant Downside Protection (NYSE:FSK)",
        "body": "Iryna Drozd\n\nFS KKR Stock: Outperformed BDC Peers Recently\n\nFS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK) stock has performed relatively well, notching a 1Y total return of more than 20%. However, that pales in comparison to its business development peers, represented in the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD). Accordingly, BIZD delivered a total 1Y total return of more than 26%, even though FSK still trades at a relatively attractive discount of 19% against its NAV per share. The discount has narrowed since my previous bullish FSK update in early April 2024.\n\nFSK/BIZD price chart (weekly, medium-term, adjusted for dividends) (TradingView)\n\nMy previous article highlighted concerns about FS KKR's non-accruals challenges. Back then, FSK was valued at a wider discount of 22% to its NAV per share. Based on FSK's Q1 earnings release in May 2024, it seems like FSK management has alleviated investor concerns. FSK's outperformance against BIZD since its February 2024 lows suggests that the market has likely priced in steep pessimism, potentially helping FSK outperform moving forward.\n\nFS KKR: Non-Accruals Still A Concern\n\nObservant FS KKR investors are likely aware of FSK's relatively high non-accruals in its portfolio. Accordingly, FSK registered 4.2% of non-accruals (6.5% based on amortized cost) against its portfolio fair value in Q1. It indicates a notable improvement from the 5.5% non-accrual metric (based on fair value) against FSK's portfolio in Q4FY2023. Consequently, I assess that the market seems satisfied with management's ability to mitigate these challenges.\n\nManagement provided more insights at FSK's Q1 earnings call into some of the efforts undertaken to help improve FSK's portfolio resilience. Accordingly, these include improvements in the Global Jet situation, recapitalization of converted second-lien loans for Witter, and restructured first-lien debt. In addition, FSK also reported that KBS completed a \"full consensual restructuring.\" As a result, it \"resulted in equitization of a portion of the non-accruing second out loan and FSK and other lenders taking control of the company.\"\n\nIn addition, management underscores FSK's firm commitment to assure investors about its focus on rectifying the non-accruals challenges. FSK articulated it has a \"dedicated restructuring and workout team led by Lauren Kruger.\" Moreover, FSK also called upon assistance and expertise from KKR Advisors to help with the KBS restructuring. Consequently, it should help quell investor pessimism about a worsening impact.\n\nFSK NAV per share and NII per share estimates % (TIKR)\n\nNotwithstanding FSK's recent outperformance against its peers, Wall Street is still relatively cautious. Analysts have downgraded FSK's estimates, suggesting FSK's NII per share could decline in 2024. As a result, it would likely impede FSK's ability to lift its NAV per share markedly, justifying the need for the market to reflect caution on its valuation.\n\nIn addition, the highlighted challenges raise questions about whether FSK could sustain its highly attractive dividend payout over the next two years.\n\nFSK: Valuation Is Still Very Cheap\n\nFSK Quant Grades (Seeking Alpha)\n\nWhile investor concerns about FS KKR's non-accrual challenges are justified, FSK's valuation remains relatively attractive. Seeking Alpha Quant assigns FSK an \"A+\" valuation grade, reflecting significant pessimism.\n\nFSK's forward NII per share multiple of 7x is well below its financial sector peers. It's also below its 10Y average and capital markets peers' median of 8.6x. In other words, the market isn't dumb. While the possibility of FSK's supplemental or special dividends could be curtailed, FSK's forward dividend yield of more than 14% has likely reflected such risks.\n\nIs FSK Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?\n\nFSK price chart (weekly, medium-term, adjusted for dividends) (TradingView)\n\nIn addition, FSK's price action (adjusted for dividends) has remained robust. Since bottoming in February 2024, FSK's buyers have returned, helping to sustain its uptrend bias.\n\nI've also not assessed red flags in FSK's price action behooving significant caution. Therefore, the market may have baked in substantial pessimism in FS KKR's non-accruals challenges earlier in 2024. Given the potentially lower NII per share accretion, a considerable valuation re-rating might be an uphill task in the near term. However, FSK's risk/reward still seems favorable, as highlighted by its constructive price action and appealing valuation.\n\nRating: Maintain Buy.\n\nImportant note: Investors are reminded to do their due diligence and not rely on the information provided as financial advice.

So, super excited to have Jonah on the show.\n\nJonah Lupton: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n\nRS: Yeah, it's great to have you on. I'd love it if we just started at the beginning, or maybe somewhere in the middle in terms of your narrative. Let's introduce you to our audience, some on Seeking Alpha already know you. How would you articulate your journey thus far in the investing world, and what brought you to Seeking Alpha? And how did you name your investing group, Fundamental Growth Investor? Let's start in those places.\n\nJL: Okay. So, I mean, my investing journey goes back more than 20 years. My father was a long time Wall Street veteran. When I decided to go to college, I was actually crazy enough to pick premed as my major. And then once I got into premed, I realized that it was not for me. And I quickly fell into finance and economics, did very, very well. I'm not surprised. I've always loved numbers.\n\nI excelled in those subjects in high school, graduated college, went to Morgan Stanley, then went to Smith Barney. Then when I left Smith Barney, those two firms actually got together, they merged. And then I worked for a couple of other investment banks, private banks in Boston. Then I actually took a 10-year break from running client capital.\n\nSo when I was at those firms, I was on the wealth management side. So I was running, call it, $0.5 billion of client capital, high net worth foundations, non-profits, et cetera. Ran a couple of tech startups, was out in Silicon Valley for a little while, and then came back during the pandemic.\n\nAnd when everything got shut down, that included the company that I was running at the time. So naturally, I decided to get on Twitter and start talking about stocks and investing, ended up launching a Substack newsletter, ended up launching my Seeking Alpha service, and thousands of subscribers later, here we are.\n\nSo I run a couple of different services just on those two platforms. I've been running Seeking Alpha, I think now for about 18 months. I think I'm in the top 10 now. So people seem to like my service. I am definitely a growth investor, but I don't pigeonhole myself into just growth stocks. I mean, I'm trying to make as much money as I possibly can.\n\nSo if that means I end up owning some undervalued value stocks or cyclicals, that's fine too. I have an energy stock in my portfolio, which is definitely not growth, but it's a company that's up almost 300% in the last few years, or actually last two years since I started buying it.\n\nSo definitely a growth investor. I would say probably about 20% of my portfolio is small caps and then the rest is probably split up between large caps, mid caps. So I'm looking for growth stocks with the best fundamentals at the most compelling valuations. That's kind of how I describe it.\n\nI'm looking for stocks that have at least 50% upside in the next two years and at least 100% upside in the next three or four years. Most of my stocks end up doubling much faster than three or four years because I'm finding them when they're cheap and I'm picking the right entry points and exit points.\n\nSo, for instance, I got into CELSIUS (CELH), CELSIUS energy drinks, which a lot of people are familiar with. I started buying that stock in May of 2020 at $3 and exited my position a couple of weeks ago in the mid-$80s. So that turned out to be a very, very profitable position for me for the last three or four years, and I'm looking for stocks like that.\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI) was another stock that I found last year. When NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) last May had their big breakout gap-up earnings report as they sort of unveiled the H100 to the world, NVIDIA was up 25% or 30% that day. I actually started buying NVIDIA the next day.\n\nI've done pretty well with NVIDIA, even though it was a little bit late to the party, but I started to think what other companies might benefit from these H100s and this new AI chip revolution, found Super Micro did more due diligence, did a deep dive on the company. I started building my position under $200. And I've now sold about 90% of that position at an average price of somewhere over $1,000.\n\nSo, I mean, there's plenty of stocks out there that people just aren't paying attention to, or they don't understand the story, or they don't have -- they don't recognize the catalyst that are coming up and those catalysts are not properly being priced into the stock and the fundamentals.\n\nSo typically, I'm going to own 20 to 25 core holdings, which are positioned typically over 3%. I will go up to 10%, 15%, 20% in a position. Typically, most of that over 10% is capital appreciation. I'm very sensitive about not trimming my winners too aggressively because if I catch them right, I want to ride them for two, three years, four years, five years like I did with Celsius.\n\nSo I don't want to get too aggressive with trimming unless the valuation has really gotten too frothy and the multiples gotten too expanded.\n\nI also have five or 10, sometimes 15 swing trades in my portfolio. So those are typically positions 1% to 2% each. There are stocks that I like, I like the company, the fundamentals are strong, but there's something that just, I don't like enough to not have me build a bigger position.\n\nSo, for instance, well, Coinbase (COIN) actually got stopped out this week, but a stock like Coinbase, it's my exposure to crypto. I have zero interest in owning crypto coins or any of that stuff. But Coinbase is obviously a platform that allows crypto transactions.\n\nSo if I want to play crypto, Coinbase is kind of the only way to do it, but delusion and SBC is just horrendous at Coinbase, makes it impossible for me to have a larger position in that stock.\n\nSame with, I got into Snapchat (SNAP) today as a swing trade. I won't own that stock as a core position for a bunch of reasons, but I'm more than willing to have it as a swing trade, as the technicals breakout, because I'm more of a breakout trader.\n\nThe third piece of my investment strategy, so 20 to 25 core holdings, anywhere from 3% to 20%; swing trades, 5 to 15, anywhere from 1 to 2%; and I'll own those as long as the fundamentals and the technicals remain strong.\n\nSo right now some of my swing trades are Sea Limited (SE), Robinhood (HOOD), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Palantir (PLTR), AppFolio (APPF), Reddit (RDDT), Snapchat, Amazon (AMZN). So strong companies, but I just don't like them enough to have them as core positions, so they work as swing trades.\n\nAnd then the third piece, which is really important, which I've gotten pretty good at is hedging. So I typically short the index ETFs as my hedges and I'll overweight whichever index ETFs are showing relative weakness. So there's typically four that I use: it's the (QQQ)s, which is the NASDAQ; it's (IWM), which is the Russell 2000; it's (ARKK), which is the ARK Innovation ETF; (FFTY), which is the IBD Innovator ETF.\n\nSo this year, my heaviest hedges were IWM and ARKK. So I typically run my portfolio on margin. Now disclosure, margin is risky, margin is scary, don't do it unless you know what you're doing. And I would only use margin when I'm using hedges.\n\nSo I'm typically running my longs at anywhere from 100% to 160%. So 40% to 60% of that is on margin, but I'm using a lot of hedges. So my net exposure is somewhere between 80% to 85%, maybe as high as 90% in the good market, maybe as low as 70% or 75%. If things are getting kind of dicey in the markets, or we're going into a big earnings week or a big macro week with like CPI, PPI, jobs, that's where I want to have a little bit less exposure. And then I trade around those hedges during the day.\n\nBut this year, if you go and you look at the performance, ARKK is still down, I think 15% year-to-date, IWM is basically flat on the year. I forgot to mention this, probably should have started with this. I'm up 150% year-to-date in my portfolio. I was up 134% last year. So this year, my longs have acted very, very well for me.\n\nSuper Micro was up 350% at the highs where I was doing most of my trimming. Celsius was up 80% or 90% when I did most of my trimming and I'm out of Celsius now, like I said. And then I probably have another five or six stocks in my portfolio that are up anywhere from 80% to 150% year-to-date, companies like TransMedics (TMDX), Aspen Aerogels (ASPN), companies that I still like, but companies that have done very well this year.\n\nSo my longs have done incredibly well and my hedges really haven't hurt me at all. I've actually made money on my IWM and my ARKK hedges. My QQQ hedge has been a little bit of a drag, but that's all right. There's plenty of bait in my portfolio to make up for it. So those are kind of like the three pieces of my portfolio, there's the core holdings, there's the swing trades, which I'm only doing in a good market. If we're in a bad market, bear market, whatever you want to call it, choppy market, I'm typically not going to have any swing trades because the technicals don't look that great.\n\nAnd then the third piece is the hedges. This year, like I said, I've been tilted more heavily towards ARKK and IWM. Now, if IWM starts to show relative strength to ARKK and QQQ, then I'll start to underweight IWM and overweight my QQQ hedge. Last year, it was ARKK that really saved me.\n\nSo, like I said, it was up 134% last year. I think it was up 86% going into the summertime when we got that big pullback from July. That's when I put on a 30% or 40% ARKK short, held that short or hedge, whatever you want to call it into the October lows, sold off or cover the hedge and then use that capital to add to some of my stocks that had pulled back and then rallied hard into year-end.\n\nSo, I mean, I do think if someone can learn how to hedge their portfolio with some of these index ETFs, and they don't have to short necessarily. There's a lot of inverse ETFs out there now. So if you're a broker IRA, whatever, doesn't allow a shorting, I mean, there's ways to hedge your portfolio with inverse ETFs.\n\nAnd I just think now is a good time to start to add hedges to your portfolio as the markets feel like they're getting a little bit top heavy. And it's possible we get a pullback this summer like we did last summer, maybe that last two months, maybe that last three months, and then we could get that year-end rally. But a lot's going to depend on macro inflation, what the FOMC does, what the election's looking like. So, I mean, the next six months will be very interesting.\n\nRS: How long did it take you to develop your strategy, A? B, would you say it's agnostic to - you talked about looking at some of the macro things and navigating for that. Is it agnostic to those things? Will you stay true to this strategy no matter what happens? And then kind of the third prong of that question would be, you mentioned your due diligence process, and I'm curious what that looks like.\n\nJL: Yep. So I definitely look at macro. I mean, I'm not a macro expert. I don't try to predict where interest rates are going or where inflation is going. I track all of it. But I mean, I do have to have an opinion because I do have to try to position my portfolio when hedges accordingly. But at the end of the day, I mean, I'm more focused on fundamentals and valuations and knowing that if I find the right stocks, I hold them for two years, three years, four years, macro might be a headwind one year, macro might be a tailwind the next year.\n\nSo I try not to get caught up too much in the short-term fluctuations because of macro or something the FOMC said, or hot or cold jobs report. But I mean, obviously, impacts the market, impacts the stocks, impacts my subscribers.\n\nSo I have to pay attention. I try to have loose opinions, but I try to stay very agile, like I don\u2019t. So my strategy's definitely changed over the last few years. I definitely don't stay married to my stocks like I probably used to a few years ago. When the story starts to change, the fundamentals start to change, something in my investment thesis starts to break down.\n\nI am going to either trim that position aggressively or get out. Celsius is a good example. I was certainly one of the biggest bulls out there for Celsius over the past four years. I've done dozens of write-ups, probably hundreds of posts on Celsius. I was the one posting monthly, retail sales scan data, posting my investment models, and I was right for four years, I nailed it.\n\nPepsi (PEP) came in as their distributor, like the story played out perfectly. And coming into this year, I thought revenue growth would be somewhere in that 50% range, which would get them close to about $2 billion in revenues.\n\nAnd when we got Q1 earnings, I knew the story was changing. Like revenues had started to slow down so much that I knew there was no way they were going to get to my targets for the year. And then when analysts started doing their write-ups for Q1 earnings, they started talking about this Pepsi inventory reduction.\n\nAnd that's when I knew that like, I just, I need to get out of the position. Things were about to go from bad to worse with the story. And the multiple was already pretty extended to the point where any bad news was not going to be received well by the market, it wasn't priced in yet. So that's why I started exiting my position in the 90s and then aggressively got out in the 80s. Once I got, I think it was the April retail sales data. And then today, we got the last two months and Celsius is now growing 20% year-over-year.\n\nI mean, this was a company that was growing triple digits year-over-year, just eight or nine months ago. And then that growth slowed down into the 50s, the 40s, the 30s, and now we're in the 20s. So I just think that multiple is going to have to get compressed significantly over the next three to six months kind of right size the company for where the fundamentals are right now.\n\nSo I try not to marry my stocks, as I say, we date our stocks, we don't marry them. And we only keep dating them as long as the fundamentals stay strong and valuations make sense. The hedging is something that I started doing last year. So in 2020, I think I was up 190%. Yeah, 2020, 2021, I was up 90% for the year.\n\nI was up 140% at the highs going into 2021 Q3 earnings, had a lot of tech, cloud software, FinTech exposure, got absolutely destroyed in Q3 earnings. And unfortunately rode those stocks down too far into year-end. So I went from 140% up for the year to up, I think, it was 92% for the year. And then 2022 is when I really started to pivot my strategy and pay more attention to where's the strength, sector rotations.\n\nSo I was out of most of my tech stocks in late 2021, early 2022, pivoted into energy, shipping, those are my two biggest sectors for the first half of 2022. Once they started getting tired, I started to rotate back into some of my typical growth stocks, the Fintechs, the e-commerce names that have been beaten down pretty hard over those previous six months to 12 months. And then in 2023 is when I started to add the hedges as well.\n\nSo, I mean, my strategy has definitely evolved. Hopefully, I don't have to go back to where I was in 2022 and like get out of most of my stocks and rotate into value sectors, which I would prefer not to do, and it's just not my comfort zone. But at the end of the day, I don't want to fight the market. And if the market is going to punish my specific strategy for a long period of time, I'm more than willing to pivot into whatever strategy might work for me and my subscribers.\n\nWith that said, I mean, my stocks have done very, very well over the past few years. And even though some of them might be starting to run out of gas and kind of hitting that ceiling on valuation, trying to time the perfect exit at a high is very difficult. And then you also have to pay a lot of taxes. So that's where the hedges work well for me. I can stay a little bit more patient with my winners, knowing that if I'm hedging properly, I'll protect some of those gains.\n\nAnd if the markets pull back, those stocks pull back with them, making the money on the hedges, not my longs, trim off the hedges, add to my longs, rinse and repeat. So, I would welcome a pullback this summer. I kind of hope we get one because I know that my hedges will give me some protection and then I'll be able to use some of the cash that I'm building up to add to some of my longs as we get towards the end of that pullback.\n\nRS: And what else would you add in terms of your due diligence process?\n\nJL: Oh, yeah. So part of my services on Seeking Alpha is the research. So all of my subscribers get my deep dives, my mini deep dives and my earnings write-ups. So deep dives are typically two per month. They're anywhere from 8,000 or 10,000 words and they go through the overview, kind of like the history of the company, talk about the founders, why was the company started, what's the mission, et cetera. And then we get into what's the business model, the market opportunity, the competitive landscape, the risks, and then we talked about valuation, technicals, investment models, and that's a deep dive.\n\nAnd I actually did a survey last week for all of my subscribers asking probably 25 or 30 questions, just trying to find out how many people are reading my deep dives, how they're using the rest of my service and trying to figure out where I could add more value or make some changes. And I was surprised that I think 88% or 89% of my subscribers actually read my deep dives, which I thought the number would be half of that to be honest. And then I do\u2026\n\nRS: That's a big number for long form.\n\nJL: Oh yeah, I was shocked\u2026now whether they were lying or not, just to try to make them feel better, I don't know. But because I thought if people aren't reading the deep dives and they're taking 15 hours or 20 hours a week or every two weeks, maybe it's just not worth doing them. But if people are reading them, they obviously see the value.\n\nAnd then, I mean, with the deep dives, if I'm doing 24 of these a year, obviously, I don't own most of these positions because the stocks I own, I've already done deep dives on it.\n\nSo what I do at that point is then we do mini deep dives. So typically, twice a year, I do a mini deep dive on all of my current holdings and explain to my subscribers what's my investment thesis? Am I still bullish? Where do I see the financials going over the next two or three years? What are my thoughts on the current valuation?\n\nAnd just reaffirm why I like the stock and why I'm adding to it now or why I would add on pullbacks. And then every quarter on, when we get our quarterly earnings reports, we do a earnings write-up anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 words and just talk about that company and where they are right now. What did last quarter look like? What does guidance look like? Any new products or catalysts on the horizon that we should be paying attention to.\n\nSo those are kind of the three pieces of the research part of the service, the deep dives, mini deep dives and earnings write-ups, and then every subscriber gets access to my investment portfolio spreadsheet, which has all of my core holdings, swing trades, hedges, and then all of my daily notes.\n\nSo all day long from 6:00 in the morning until 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon, I'm in front of my computers and I'm typically on the spreadsheet posting commentary for all of my stocks, charts and then all of my activities. So I'm adding to positions, trimming positions, starting new positions, all of that goes on the spreadsheets. All my subscribers can see it in real-time.\n\nSo literally, when I get filled on an order, as soon as I get filled, I go right to the spreadsheet and post it, so all my subscribers can see it. If they want to copy it, that's on them. Obviously, I don't provide any advice. I don't provide recommendations. My services are just meant to show my subscribers what I'm doing in real time. And hopefully, that helps them make better decisions for themselves.\n\nRS: What would you say is a good example of one of the 20 stocks that you would talk about and one that you're following, that you don't own, that you're looking at maybe as something to include further down the line?\n\nJL: Good question. So some of the swing trades are stocks that are like on the edge, stocks that I've started to follow, I like a lot about them. I'm just not ready to go full bore into that company. So like a Robinhood.\n\nSo I thought Robinhood was dead a couple of years ago. After the GameStop (GME) meme craze, they were suspending activity, their customers were pissed off, the CEO looked like kind of a sleazy guy. And I just thought Robinhood was done. The stock got down to, I think, $6 or $7. And I feel like they've really transformed the company over the last couple of years.\n\nThe CEO looks more - he looks and sounds more mature now. I think he's learned some lessons. The company has 24 million accounts, which is insane. That is such a big number compared to all of the other platforms out there.\n\nWhere they fall short is the average account size. So Robinhood's average account size is only $5,500, very, very tiny compared to all of the other platforms. Schwab is somewhere around 225,000. IBKR is somewhere between 150 and 180. E*TRADE is somewhere around 100,000. So even though Robinhood has the most accounts, they are very, very tiny. But I think that's an opportunity.\n\nSo I think a lot of their customers are early, earlier in their investing career, probably early 20s, mid 20s, they're just starting to work. They're just starting to make money. And these people have the ability over the next five, 10 years to make big contributions to those accounts, do 401(k) rollovers, maybe they inherit some money, maybe they sell a business. I mean, you don't know, but I think there's a lot of growth potential there.\n\nAnd now they're being pretty aggressive with some of their IRA matching contribution plans, and they have this new Robinhood Gold Card that a lot of people want access to. So they have to roll over money in order to qualify for that.\n\nSo right now Robinhood has about $135 billion in AUC, which is assets under custody. I think there's a path to like 300 billion over the next few years. I think in three years, they could easily get to 30 million accounts, average account size of $10,000, 300 billion at their 1.8% sort of revenue to AUC number that puts them somewhere around $5.4 billion in revenues. If they hit $5.4 billion, this is probably a stock that has the chance to go up maybe 150% over the next three or four years.\n\nSo, I mean, there's a lot I like, I'm still digging in. I want to see a couple of more quarters of results and then I might be ready to build a bigger position. So right now, it's a swing trade. So as long as the technicals hold up, I'll stay in it. And if I continue to like what I see from the company, I might make it into a core holding.\n\nSo typically, like companies that I think I might want to own in the next 12 months that are like almost there for me, they'll become a swing trade, and then at some point they might get upgraded to a core holding. I mean, there's a few stocks that I was actually talking about today with my subscribers that have been beaten down so bad that I'm wondering if they're worth looking at now.\n\nOne is a company called Unity (U). I mean, that stock has just been absolutely obliterated. I believe they've brought in new management. Revenues are going to take a nosedive this year, but analysts expect them to bounce back next year. So, I mean, the problem is, I mean, you start going bottom fishing for these stocks and even though they look cheap, they can stay cheap for a long time, because they - it could be a frustrating turnaround story.\n\nBut at the same time, you go buy stocks at their 52-week highs or all-time highs, and there's a chance they look kind of expensive. Like CrowdStrike (CRWD), for instance, I have no cybersecurity exposure in my portfolio, I wish I could, but every time I look at a cybersecurity company, I just - my jaw drops at the valuation.\n\nI mean, right now CrowdStrike, and it's a phenomenal company, I've owned it in the past, but the stock's trading at like 60x next year's or next 12 months EBITDA. And that's before you include the SBC, the stock-based comp. If you include the stock-based comp in the EBITDA or the free cashflow, I mean, now it's trading it over 100x. I just -- I don't understand how you justify that multiple.\n\nGreat company, but I think that's where I try to separate great company from great stock. I want to own great stocks. I want to make money.\n\nRS: So is there ever a time where you get excited about something fundamentally and then look at the technicals and it turns you off?\n\nJL: So if I get really excited about the fundamentals and the valuation and I have a strong investment thesis, and I see catalysts on the horizon that I don't think are being properly appreciated or priced in, I don't care about the technicals. And I will add to that stock as long as I have the conviction.\n\nSo technicals for me only really matter with swing trades. Once something is a core holding, I have conviction. I don't mind adding on pullbacks even when the technicals look like crap. So it's really just the swing trades where like my - I don't have the conviction to have a bigger position. I'm not going to go against the technicals in that case, which is one reason.\n\nSo I started a position in Zillow (Z) a couple - a few days ago, after it reclaimed the 200-day moving average, because I feel like once the FOMC finally cuts rates, you're going to see Zillow take off. And even if mortgage rates continue to come down, we should see stocks like Zillow, Redfin (RDFN), Rocket Mortgage (RKT) do well, but I don't really have that much conviction. This is sort of a catalyst play. And as soon as Zillow failed to close above the 200, I got rid of it. I stopped out.\n\nSo swing trades definitely respect the technicals. I mean, last year when I got really excited about Super Micro, it was last summer, somewhere around 180, 185, I believe. I started a 2% or 3% position. And then as the summer went along, the fall went along, the stock basically went sideways for four or five months.\n\nAnd I couldn't understand it. I thought, I don't understand what the market doesn't understand about SMCI. They're building these custom liquid cooling racks for NVIDIA. We see NVIDIA blowing out earnings every quarter. Why is SMCI not getting any kudos?\n\nSo I just kept building my position, building my position. And then in January of this year, after I built my position to about 13% of my portfolio, they came out and pre-announced their -- I think that was their fiscal 2024 Q2 earnings, I forget, Q2 I think, and the stock jumped up, I think 40% or 50% the next day and rally another 200%. And it was just, I mean, it's what I was expecting to happen. I just didn't think it was going to happen in three weeks. I thought it would play out over the next two or three years.\n\nSo once that stock started getting closer to my two or three-year price target, obviously, I had to do the prudent thing and start trimming back my position. But the technicals, I mean, I don't remember exactly what the charts looked like in late 2023, but I think it might've been trading below its 200, but I just -- I don't care because the fundamentals to me were just screaming bye, bye, bye.\n\nRS: Do you ever regret trimming your position when it starts to run like that?\n\nJL: So I trimmed the SMCI a little bit too early. I started trimming probably in the mid-600s, but I didn't think it was going to go to 1,200 in four weeks.\n\nRS: How right can I be for God's sakes? How good am I?\n\nJL: I mean, yeah, in the hindsight, yes, I definitely trimmed SMCI too early. But a lot of times, like if I have a 13% position and it starts to rip. I'm probably going to let it get up to 15% or 16% before I start trimming it back. And then that's kind of like, that's kind of the ceiling for me.\n\nSo like every 5% it goes up, I'll trim it back to \u2013 to bring it back down to a 15% or 16% position. And then once it started to -- once it got over 1,000, that's when I started getting much more aggressive with my trimming. And by the time it got up to 1,200, I think, it had gotten down to maybe a 5% or 6% position in my portfolio.\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) sort of did the same thing. I love TransMedics. I've owned it for almost three years now since it was in the 20s. Now it's in the 140s. And I had a, I don\u2019t know, 15% position going into their last earnings report. They crushed it. Stock was up 30%, 40% the next day, and I had to start trimming it back. Just the position was just too big for my portfolio because one of my big concerns is, when I'm running a service like this, people sign up at all different times of the year.\n\nSome people have been with me for three years, some have been with me for three months, and someone might sign up tomorrow and see my spreadsheet and think, \u201cOh, Jonah has a 18% position in TransMedics, he must really love TransMedics.\u201d And then they try to copy it and build an 18% position. And what they don't realize right away is, well, it's 18% because I've been buying the stock for the last three years. My cost basis is probably in the 60s or 70s.\n\nSo I try to be mindful of that, but at the end of the day, like, I mean, I still have to run my portfolio in the way that's best for me. And then I hope my subscribers can keep up or at least learn my strategy over time.\n\nRS: You talked a bit about NVIDIA and I'm not sick about talking about it. Maybe some people are sick about hearing about it. But I think it behooves us as investors to understand the nuance and sometimes the bombastic hyperbole that is the discussion around NVIDIA as it grows and flows and evolves.\n\nHow are you thinking about NVIDIA? How do you think about it as a stock in general and as a leader of the market right now?\n\nJL: So they just did a 10 for 1 split. So I was buying in the high 300. So I guess that means I was buying in the high 30s now. And today, it closed at -- see where are we? So right now, it's at $127.40, I don't know what it's doing after hours. Oh, it's up 1% after hours.\n\nI mean, just yesterday, people were talking about the bubbles in NVIDIA is dead, it's going back down under a 100. And then, NVIDIA gave everyone the middle finger today and was up 7%. So I guess, the story wasn't dead, maybe it was just taking a breather. I love NVIDIA. I wish I didn't own AMD. Thankfully my NVIDIA position is bigger than my (AMD) position.\n\nBut a lot of people miss NVIDIA. So they thought, okay, I'll buy AMD who maybe will -- it'll be a catch up trade. And a year later, we're realizing AMD is like five years behind NVIDIA.\n\nI don't even know what to make of NVIDIA. I mean, I don't think we know what the next three, four, five years is going to look like for artificial intelligence. We don't know their specific roadmap. We don't know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips.\n\nI mean, we've all heard stories about the hyperscalers like Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), they're going to want to build their own chips, okay, it sounds good. I don't know if they'll actually be able to do it.\n\nAnd then how will those chips compare to whatever the newest, greatest NVIDIA chip is? And if they're building their own chips, are they going to save enough money by using an inferior chip to justify not using the best NVIDIA chip? Like, I don't know.\n\nI mean, China, ByteDance (BDNCE) is apparently trying to develop their own chips now. I just -- it's wild. I just don't think, I think if you believe in artificial intelligence, I just think this is the one stock that you have to own and you can't try to trade in and out of it because it's going to do things like this, down 6% one day, up 8% the next day.\n\nThank God, I started buying it a year ago when it gapped up on that earnings report. Even though I didn't fully understand the importance of H100s and where that would lead us.\n\nBut now, I mean, you listen to these earnings calls from all the hyperscalers and all they talk about is trying to get their hands on as many H100s as possible, or H200s and the new BGs that are coming out. I mean, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is getting ready to build a supercomputer with Dell (DELL) and Super Micro with tens of thousands of H100s. Like - it's like an arms race, which company can buy the most H100s.\n\nAnd then I don't even know what's going to happen in two or three years. Like, let's just say Meta (META) has 10,000 H100s. At what point does the next, like, do they have to upgrade? And then what do they do with the H100? Do they sell them off for $0.50 on the $1 or do they keep them and go buy whatever the new chip is? I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to play out. I just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and LLMs, and I just think NVIDIA is still the best way to play it.\n\nAnd I mean, the stock might be expensive, I don't know. I mean, right now, the company's growing revenues by triple digits, earnings by triple digits, and it's trading at like 40x earnings. Like that's obviously not expensive, but obviously those growth rates are not sustainable.\n\nI don't think we really know where growth is going to normalize out. I believe the analysts are still looking for 50% or 60% growth next year. But then does it stay at 50% for the next five years? Does it drop down to 20%? Do margins stay at 55%? Do they drop to 45%? I have no idea. I'm not sure anyone knows. And if they think they know, they probably don't. And the people calling the top are just - they're just pissed. They're the ones that never owned it.\n\nSo like they're all trying to call the top to justify the fact that they never owned it. So it's just -- it's been a wild story. I mean, that's, I think the stock was down to 120 last January, something like that. So, I mean, it's up 10x in the last 18 months.\n\nNow I've heard the problem is some of their employees have made so much freaking money the last couple of years on NVIDIA stock that they don't ever have to work again. So I don't know what you do about that.\n\nRS: Yeah. It sounds like a good problem until it's right in front of you and then it\u2019s probably not such a great problem. I'm curious, you mentioned Tesla (TSLA), that's another controversial stock that I don't know if people know where to land on it. What are your thoughts on them?\n\nJL: Yes, I was talking to my subscribers about it today. So I don't own Tesla right now. Tesla is one of those stocks that I do think it's overvalued right now based on the fundamentals, but that may not be the right way to look at the company.\n\nI mean, if you think Tesla is just a car company, it's probably overvalued by 500%, right? I mean, Ford (F) and (GM) traded like 8x earnings and Tesla is probably trading at 45x earnings on a year where I believe revenues and earnings are both supposed to be down this year or flat best case scenario.\n\nSo how you justify 40x earnings for that, I have no idea. So Tesla is definitely overvalued where it is. I mean, I would say based on the fundamentals for this year, it's probably an $80 stock.\n\nHowever, if we are going to continue to see this electric vehicle revolution, and five or 10 years from now, every state has banned the sale of ICE vehicles, and there are supercharging networks from coast to coast. I mean, then it is possible that Tesla, over the next five, 10 years, can grow revenues at 15%, 20%, 25% a year. But even that doesn't probably get you back to a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nI mean, where that extra $2 trillion, $3 trillion is coming from that people talk about, it's all the other stuff. It's the Robotaxi network, it's the humanoids or the robots that they're apparently working on.\n\nAnd I was talking, because I have a big position in Uber (UBER). I've owned Uber for the past couple of years. I was loading up on it in the summer of 2022 when the stock got down into the 20s and I've trimmed my position back. I mean, Uber is now almost at 8% position in my portfolio. So I mean, still decent size, pretty low cost basis.\n\nAnd I mean, for me, the two biggest risks are recession, where people stop going out to eat, they stop traveling, you have less conferences and it's those airport rides where Uber makes a lot of money, bringing people to bars and restaurants. So if people were going out and spending less money, that would be very bad for Uber. That's one risk.\n\nThe other risk is Tesla and what they do with an autonomous robotaxi network. And we're going to get a presentation, I guess, in August, that's what Elon Musk has been talking about for the past couple of months, but no one really knows what to expect.\n\nWe don't know if, at least, I don't think we know, is Tesla going to develop like a special car or taxi for this robo network, or are they just going to unveil the technology that's going to power consumers vehicles so they can like donate their vehicle to the Tesla robo taxi network and then have their car essentially act as a Uber during the day and pick people up and then they split the money with Tesla.\n\nLike, I don't know. I'm trying to like think through what it's going to be. I'm trying not to waste too much time thinking about it because until we get that August presentation, I'm not really sure we're going to have any concrete answers. And then I don't even know if Tesla is going to try to do this themselves or are they going to work with Uber.\n\nUber has over 130 million customers that use their app. They've been doing this for, I mean, almost 20 years, at least, well, 15 years, and they know how to run a ride sharing network.\n\nSo are they going to partner with Uber or are they going to compete against Uber? And I don't even know the answer to that yet. But I mean, I've seen, I know Cathie Wood is talking about Tesla, 10x upside over the next decade. I mean, maybe that sounds a little crazy, but I also didn't think we'd have, Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA and Microsoft combined market caps of $10 trillion.\n\nSo is it possible that Tesla could go up 10x from here? Maybe, I mean, if they really build a robotaxi network and 20% of the U.S. decides to buy Teslas and use those Teslas as part of the robotaxi network, like I'm not even sure that the numbers work out.\n\nSo it's one that I want to get back in. I'm just trying to find the right time, the right price. I could see the stock running up into that August presentation. So if you look at a chart for Tesla, it's currently below the VWAP from the December highs. If it pushes back above the VWAP from the December highs, I'll get into Tesla with the swing trade. And hopefully, I can hold that into the August presentation because I'm very, very curious what Elon Musk is going to come up with.\n\nRS: Jonah, I really appreciate this first conversation. There's so much here to chew on for investors. Anything that you want to leave investors with as we wind down?\n\nJL: I mean, I'm sure they probably got a feel for my strategy. So I mean, like I told you before we started recording, I mean, I run a pretty aggressive strategy, but I know what I own. I do a lot of research and due diligence. I understand position sizing, risk management. I have investment models for all of my stocks that I update quarterly or more.\n\nSo I have a pretty good feel for valuation and where I think the prices could go over the next three or four years if everything plays out according to plan. So if you are looking to build a portfolio, manage it yourself, which I think you should do.\n\nI think most of us should be active investors rather than passive. I think most of us, if we put a little bit of effort into it, can outperform the indexes. Like I'm just way too competitive to have my money sitting in (SPY) or (QQQ).\n\nI never would be comfortable just owning the index and doing whatever the index does. I want to outperform. I mean, that's me and I've been doing it year after year. So if you're looking for someone like myself that runs a pretty concentrated portfolio of 20 stocks and swing trades and hedges, definitely check out my service. I'd love to try to help out.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.",

        "body": "(Reuters) -Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as \"Roaring Kitty\", had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.\n\nThe filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.\n\nThe filing, which lists Keith Gill as the reporting person, included a section \"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat\" under which the descriptor \"I am not a cat\" was checked.\n\nThe U.S. SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGill usually discloses his trading positions on platforms such as YouTube and Reddit, where he is known as \"DeepFuckingValue\", to the many retail traders who follow his cues.\n\nThe filing showed Gill owns 9 million shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.\n\nChewy rival Petco Health and Wellness Company's shares fell 4%, reversing earlier gains.\n\nShares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.\n\nIts sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. \"Pet humanization\" is a key part of Chewy's strategy, where owners splurge on pets as they are considered part of the family.\n\nSome analysts said last week Gill's interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.\n\nGameStop had gained nearly 700% in the 2021 meme-stock rally, fueled by Gill's posts. Gill returned to Reddit on June 2 after a years-long hiatus, with a screenshot disclosing a sizeable GameStop stock and options position.\n\nShares of the videogame retailer have swung wildly since Gill reappeared. They dropped 5.7% in volatile premarket trading on Monday, but have gained 40% for the year so far.\n\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra and Pratik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar, Devika Syamnath and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

The average S&P 500 return in the second half of those years was 7.3%. How do these compare against the overall averages? Well, for all years, first-half gains averaged 5.2% and second-half gains averaged 4.9%. So not bad. Going back to our double-digit first half years, the best performance came in 1986, when the market roared out of the starting gate and soared 25.5%. The best second half from that group was in 2012, when the S&P 500 tacked on another 17%. Still, there are no guarantees that stocks will continue to climb in the second half.

        "body": "There's something quite pleasant about having cash deposited into your investment account quarter after quarter and year after year. Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAs a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:\n\nThe F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations.\n\nThe Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nPatriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments.\n\nAn F-35 aircraft takes to the skies. Image source: Lockheed Martin.\n\nLockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products -- the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 -- this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.\n\nManagement is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly\n\nFor more than 140 years, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.\n\nAlmost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.\n\nZepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.\n\nDue to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Can Nvidia Stock Cross $1,000 Again After the Stock Split?",
        "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock popped up by a dramatic 500% in the past three years. Undoubtedly, much of this recent rally has been fueled by the company's position as a key beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave.\n\nNvidia offers a full-stack AI platform, comprising cutting-edge AI-optimized hardware chips, a complete software ecosystem, high-speed networking solutions, and servers to enable clients to build \"AI factories,\" or the essential infrastructure for AI-based outputs (text, images, audio, video). The company's accelerated product release cadence, from two years to one year, also helps it maintain technological superiority against competition.\n\nFurthermore, besides the booming demand from large hyperscale companies, enterprises, and AI start-ups, Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware and software solutions are now increasingly used in new areas such as Sovereign AI (governments building domestic AI capabilities), automotive vertical, and robotics business.\n\nThe AI frenzy propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high of over $1,200 in early June. Its recently executed 10-for-1 stock split made its stock far more accessible to retail investors.\n\nWith Nvidia's stock now around $124 at this writing, long-term investors may be keen to know if the stock can again jump to $1,000-plus levels. Let's analyze the company's fundamentals and valuations to find some answers.\n\nIntensifying competition and supply challenges\n\nNvidia's technological superiority in developing AI-optimized hardware and software enabled the company to capture a whopping 90% share of the global AI chip market. However, the company's stronghold may get challenged in the long run. Although currently far behind Nvidia, competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working hard to capture a slice of the AI market.\n\nAMD's MI300 family of data center chips witnessed strong demand, while the company is also gearing up for launching families of AI chips such as MI325 and MI350 accelerators, based on advanced architectures, in the coming months. AMD expects these chips to demonstrate faster performance, improved memory capacity, and stronger computing capabilities for AI workloads.\n\nIntel is also aggressively focusing on the AI PC opportunity and hopes to launch Lunar Lake laptop CPUs by September 2024. Lunar Lake chips are expected to be superior in performance, efficiency, and graphics processing compared to their predecessor Meteor Lake chips. Plus, Intel has also introduced Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, offering superior cost-performance benefits for training and inferencing of AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia also faces the risk of customers such as cloud players and technology giants becoming competitors, as they have been accelerating in-house development of AI-optimized chips and solutions. This risk cannot be ignored, since large cloud players account for roughly 45% of the company's data center revenues.\n\nMultiple other challenges\n\nWhile demand for Nvidia's AI chips and solutions has grown dramatically, the company continues to face supply constraints associated with procuring manufacturing, testing, and packaging capacity from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other vendors. Subsequently, the company expects demand for its new H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell chips to outpace supply well until 2025. This headwind can affect the company's growth prospects in the coming years.\n\nNvidia also accelerated the pace of release cadence (for major products or features) from once every two years to once annually. Continuously innovating and adapting hardware and software is the need of the hour in the face of increasing complexity and rapid evolution of AI models and workloads.\n\nHowever, this also exposes Nvidia to significant execution risks and to the risk of clients delaying purchases to get access to the most advanced technologies. Nvidia's rapid pace of innovation can result in early product obsolescence for its older offerings and increasing risk of self-cannibalization.\n\nValuation estimates\n\nNvidia has consistently posting impressive financial metrics for the past several quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), revenues were up by nearly 262% year over year to $26 billion, while net income soared by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 sales to grow by 97% year over year to $120 billion. While the revenue growth rate is expected to moderate in the next decade, analysts expect the company's sales to more than triple to $380.9 billion by 2034.\n\nNvidia is currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 38.6x. Assuming that this multiple reverts to its 10-year average of 22.27x (a conservative estimate), we can expect Nvidia's market capitalization to reach around $8.5 trillion by 2034. While the market cap seems huge, it is only 2.7 times the company's current $3.1 trillion market capitalization. This implies that the stock can reach north of $340 by 2034 (assuming no significant share repurchases or stock splits).\n\nAssuming Nvidia's P/S multiple remains at the current 38.6x level (a very aggressive estimate), the company's market capitalization will be around $14.7 trillion -- 4.7 times its current market capitalization. Still, the company's share price can be expected to reach close to $600 by the end of 2034.\n\nHence, based on current estimates, the chances of Nvidia's share price crossing $1,000 in the next decade appear slim. These projections, however, can change in case Nvidia makes even more dramatic advances in AI technologies in the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Volkswagen (VW) and US-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Rivian Automotive have emerged as trending companies among the influencers on social media platform \u201cX,\u201d following the German automaker's announcement of a strategic investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian. This partnership is perceived as mutually beneficial wherein Volkswagen secures access to Rivian's advanced software-defined vehicle architecture while Rivian obtains essential capital to sustain its operations and support future development, reveals the Social Media Analytics Platform of GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cInfluencers view the VW-Rivian joint venture and investment as a critical lifeline for Rivian, averting potential bankruptcy and enabling expansion into new vehicle segments. They emphasize that the financial injection will positively impact Rivian\u2019s production capabilities and market position, potentially paving the way for future collaborations and shared platforms with Volkswagen\u2019s new electric SUV lineup. However, some influencers remain uncertain about the long-term success and sustainability of the partnership.\"\n\nBelow are a few popular influencer opinions captured by GlobalData\u2019s Social Media Analytics Platform:\n\n\u201cThe joint venture with Rivian is an almost risk-free, no-brainer deal for VW but could be a write off later too. Details show that the agreement is a very good deal for VW, but the desperation of Rivian also shows that without this agreement the company might have gone bankrupt very soon. The contract terms for Rivian are very bad and it is questionable how long the lifeline VW has thrown will keep the company afloat. VW will buy Rivian for $10.83 per share. That means almost 100 million shares for $1 billion or ~10% dilution and 4.75% interest on top. To name just one example of many that shows that due diligence is not VW's favorite skill: the company has written off 1.9 billion dollars that it invested in Argo AI before 2022. At that time they made a huge press release how VW vehicles will drive with Argo AIs software fully autonomously. Well that didn't end well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith $VOW as their strategic partner, $RIVN bankruptcy risk - to the extent some investors worried about it - is now off the table. The $3B cash investment (plus $2B for the new software JV) should remove the deep 2024 EV/Rev valuation discount at which $RIVN trades (3.3x AH) vs $TSLA (5.9x). $RIVN can now move downstream and construct their new factory in Georgia to expand their TAM to the affordable luxury segment with R2 ($45K ASP) and to the mass segment with R3 ($35K ASP). Once $VOW converts $3B in new convertible notes to $RIVN equity, we estimate $VOW will own 15-20% of RIVN.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cVery big, very interesting deal (investment + new joint-venture) here between @Rivian and @VWGroup Rivian gets more $$ and institutional support in uncertain times, and VW gets badly-needed software help. Will it work out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuge news for @Rivian! @VW to invest up to $5 billion in the EV startup, helping fund development of the R2 SUV, while VW gains access to Rivian's software-defined vehicle architecture. This is an important capital infusion for Rivian that helps them cross the Valley of Death to reach scale and positive gross margins. Will we even see further collab on a shared platform for VW's new \"rugged\" Scout brand of electric SUVs coming soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat news for Rivian. VW investing $5 bil which will keep them afloat for some time. The vehicles are great but they do need some operational help.

        "body": "The S&P 500 has set one new all-time high after another in 2024, but not every stock has participated in the current bull market. Some stocks remain beaten down, well below the highs reached in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nSome of the companies behind those stocks benefited from the behavior changes ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. But as things start to resemble the way things were pre-pandemic, they don't look as attractive. Others, however, look oversold, and their current valuations don't reflect their true potential.\n\nOne example of the latter is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's share price surged as COVID-19 drove more online and contactless sales. But a couple of bad quarters and a CEO change led to a massive sell-off in shares. The stock currently trades around 81% below the all-time high it reached in mid-2021. Here's why it may be a great opportunity to buy up some shares.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's already showing signs of a turnaround\n\nOne of the biggest things weighing on PayPal over the past year was its declining active account total. Active accounts peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 and experienced four consecutive sequential declines during 2023.\n\nBut active accounts increased in the first quarter, climbing 2 million to reach 427 million total. While there's still a long way to go to get back to where it was at the end of 2022, the turnaround progress is encouraging.\n\nThe biggest driver of the active account decline was churn from inactive accounts in emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. It's now growing by adding users who are spending more and more frequently. Total payment volume was up 14% year over year despite fewer users than this time last year. Transactions per active account over the past year reached an all-time high of 60.\n\nThe virtuous cycle driving strong engagement growth\n\nThe growing engagement of PayPal users signals its network advantage. On one side of the network are consumers and on the other side are merchants. The massive consumer base using PayPal draws more merchants to accept the digital wallet and the growing number of merchants taking PayPal draws more consumers to the platform. A growing number of merchants also gives existing users more opportunities to use PayPal.\n\nThere's good reason for merchants to choose PayPal, too. Not only does it add another payment option for around 400 million online shoppers, but it also makes them more likely to complete a transaction. The company reports a 33% increase in checkout conversions when the buyer uses PayPal versus another form of payment.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile PayPal faces competition, none of its competitors has a user base the size of PayPal. That makes it practically indispensable for online merchants.\n\nThat said, fierce competition can and has weighed on PayPal's ability to charge higher fees for merchants. It also pushed the company to allow more consumer choice in its default payments, instead of forcing them to pay using methods more lucrative for the company (like cash balances).\n\nStill, it's hard to deny PayPal's position as the leading digital wallet, putting it in a prime position for the continued secular growth in e-commerce.\n\nThe stock is an absolute bargain\n\nThe stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 14x. That's incredibly low, even if you expect competition to eat into its revenue growth and margins.\n\nManagement's updated full-year 2024 guidance calls for mid- to high-single-digit earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. PayPal should be able to drive double-digit revenue growth as it returns to year-over-year active account growth this year. While non-branded checkout has weighed on its gross margin, it's cutting costs in other areas, which should result in stable to growing operating margins. That could mean PayPal exceeds its current full-year outlook.\n\nWhat's more, PayPal is aggressively buying back shares at this price. It forecasts $5 billion in free cash flow, and management plans to repurchase even more than $5 billion in shares this year. That provides a further boost to earnings per share.\n\nWall Street analysts currently expect PayPal to grow its earnings per share at a compound annual rate of almost 16% over the next five years as a result of the above factors. So, with shares trading under 14x earnings, they present an incredible bargain for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PayPal wasn\u2019t one of them.
