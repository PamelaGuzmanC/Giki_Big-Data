        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

He's got to get out now and if he doesn't get out we're going to get f------ crushed,\" said the advisor. They told CNBC they planned to approach Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday to discuss what happened at the debate.\n\n\"Game over,\" said a longtime Democratic campaign advisor, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden's 2020 White House bid.\n\nCNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.\n\n\"This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I'm speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,\" said the person, who was granted anonymity in order to recount private conversations.\n\n\"Disaster,\" said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with the president on Saturday in the Hamptons .\n\nMany of the Democratic Party's top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after President Joe Biden 's disappointing debate performance Thursday against Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nAn advisor of one of the Democratic Party's top megadonors called the debate an \"absolute train wreck\" for Biden. \"Worse than [Ronald] Reagan in '84 or [George W.] Bush in '04 or [Barack] Obama in '12,\" they added.\n\nThe problems for Biden at the debate started early. He stumbled out of the gate, appearing to lose his train of thought at times and pausing for a long moment before CNN moderators cut him off when he was discussing U.S. health care.\n\n\"Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the, with the Covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look ...\" Biden said, trailing off.\n\n\"Look, if, we've finally beat Medicare,\" Biden said, before CNN anchor and moderator Jack Tapper gently moved on. \"Thank you, President Biden,\" said Tapper.\n\nSeveral times later in the debate, the president repeated himself, or left several seconds of silence mid-answer. Throughout the evening, Biden's voice was raspy and quiet.\n\nBiden's campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News this was because the president had a cold. \"I think because of the way people analyze debates, it's going to be at first about the physical performance,\" said Landrieu.\n\nEven Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged that Biden was not in top form. \"Yes, it was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\" she said on CNN late Thursday.\n\nFor example, answering a question about border security \u2014 a top voter issue this election cycle \u2014 Biden's sentence was grammatically difficult to follow.\n\n\"I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump pounced on the stumbles. \"I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either,\" the former president quipped.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReplacing Biden on the ticket now would be extremely difficult, with less than two months until the Democratic National Convention in August. The president would effectively have to drop out of the race, leaving the decision about a nominee up to the delegates at the convention.\n\n\"It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden, I don't think there's any other way to slice it,\" Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director in the Biden administration until 2023, said on CNN.\n\n\"His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina \u2014 and he didn't do that,\" she said.",

        "body": "In this article LEVI Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Levi's store at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets in Florida. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Levi Strauss, year to date",

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023.

But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post said that the two \"presented starkly different visions for America's place in the world,\" and that it was a \"high-stakes debate.\" Before it kicked off, China's state-backed tabloid Global Times said it was expected to be \"like a reality show.\"\n\nIndia: 'Democrats in full-blown panic'\n\nThe Times of India led its story with concerns from Democrats about Biden's performance, with the headline reading: \"'We are f***ed': Democrats in full-blown panic over Joe Biden's debate performance.\" Biden \"delivered a shaky, halting performance,\" it said, while \"Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks.\" Elsewhere, India Today said Biden \"stammered and fumbled\" multiple times, while describing Trump's performance as \"forceful and aggressive.\"\n\nUK: 'Biden struggles ... Trump lies'\n\nIn the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: \"Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate.\" Many of Trump's replies to straightforward questions had little to do with the topic at hand, the paper said, and he made frequent false claims which were not fact-checked by the moderators. Biden, meanwhile, \"frequently struggled to complete his thoughts.\" The Times of London said that Biden's reelection campaign was \"plunged into crisis\" following the debate and that the current president's responses to questions were \"meandering and muddled,\" while Trump's were \"more assured and disciplined.\" Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump's attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: \"Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions.\" Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was \"marked by personal attacks.\"\n\nGermany: 'True losers ... are the Americans'\n\nGermany's broadcaster ZDF described the debate as \"more civilized\" but \"more charged\" than in 2020, adding that Trump had a better start, but Biden caught up later on, according to a CNBC translation. At first, Biden did not appear very agile and hesitated, it said, but added that his tone was \"somewhat surprisingly\" as aggressive and sharp as Trump's. On individual topics, Biden had \"clear words\" for Trump when it came to abortion, but things got \"uncomfortable\" for him on immigration \u2014 while Trump tried to dodge questions about the January 2021 Capitol Hill riot.\n\nSueddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, titled one of its stories: \"Joe Biden's bad evening,\" saying that even though his answers had more substance than Trump's, Biden's verbal stumbling raised concerns. In another story, the newspaper summarized the debate: \"Biden disgraces himself, Trump wastes his chance, but the true losers of the first TV debate in the U.S. election campaigns are the Americans.\"\n\nFrance: 'Uneven' performance",

        "title": "France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means",
        "body": "Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from \"political paralysis\" to \"immediate financial crisis.\" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.\n\nA complex system\n\nUnder France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff \u2014 a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using \"le vote utile\" \u2014 or tactical voting \u2014 to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be \"civil war\" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger \u2014 and therefore more representative \u2014 than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.\n\nMarket turmoil\n\nSuch a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a \"worse reputation globally,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs \u2014 a key indicator of French political risk \u2014 has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Spendthrift agendas\" from either party \u2014 whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax \u2014 could result in an \"immediate financial crisis,\" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently \"too optimistic\" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. \"Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,\" the analysts noted.\n\nPolitical paralysis\n\nThe CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella \u2014 Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally \u2014 was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement \"reasonable\" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would \"need an absolute majority to govern,\" in a bid to boost his backing. \"You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,\" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.",

The last time the currency was at this level was in December 1986. The currency has struggled and again weakened past the 160 level on Thursday.

        "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Ditching the Degree series, where women who have built six-figure careers without a bachelor's degree reveal the secrets of their success. Got a story to tell? Let us know! Email us at AskMakeIt@cnbc.com. Justine Parker chose her career based on a sign \u2014 not one from the universe, but an ad taped to the window of a coffee shop. It was a flier for an in-person real estate course. For $2,000 and a four-month commitment, the ad promised, anyone could earn upwards of $100,000 a year. Parker, then 24, was less interested in making six figures and more excited about becoming a licensed professional. She left the University of Georgia during her first semester when she was 19, after getting pregnant, and says she spent her early 20s feeling untethered and, at points, burned out, adjusting to her new role as a working mom. \"Since I didn't finish college, and going back with a young child felt impossible, I thought taking classes and graduating with a license would give me a similar sense of accomplishment, like I was still moving my career forward,\" Parker, 39, tells CNBC Make It. She signed up for classes that afternoon and on Dec. 31, 2009, received her Georgia real estate license in the mail. The flier lived up to its promise: Parker now owns Toes N Sand Properties, a rental management company in Orange Beach, Alabama that brought in about $500,000 in 2023, according to financial documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. After deducting business expenses and taxes, Parker earned $200,000 last year from her work as a real estate broker. Here's how she did it:\n\nBuilding a career on three jobs and 'two hours of sleep'\n\nWhen Parker found out she was pregnant, she left school and started working full time in Atlanta as a telemarketer to save money for her first child. Her high school sweetheart and now-husband, Stephen, opted out of college, working behind the counter at a sandwich shop and also as a telemarketer to support their growing family. Parker worked right up until her delivery date. The couple's first son, Brandon, was born in August 2004. They welcomed their second son, Nathan, 17 months later. After Nathan was born, Parker left telemarketing and took on three part-time jobs \u2014 pet-sitting, substitute teaching and bartending \u2014 to help cover her family's bills. These gigs, Parker says, offered the most flexible schedules so she and her husband could share child-care responsibilities. She didn't start attending real estate classes until Nathan turned 4 and her children were in school full-time. She went to classes Monday through Wednesday during the school day and then worked the late shift bartending Thursday through Sunday. \"It was chaos, but I loved it,\" Parker says. On weekends, Parker would spend her afternoons studying for the Georgia real estate exam and evenings at the bar, clocking in at 6 p.m. and leaving at 4 a.m. after closing. \"Some nights I'd get two hours of sleep before the boys woke me up at 6 a.m.,\" she adds. \"Luckily, I've never needed a lot of sleep \u2014 I wanted to spend those weekend mornings with my kids.\" The requirements to become a real estate agent vary by state, but the process generally includes completing a prelicensing course, passing an exam, getting a background check, finding a sponsoring brokerage and submitting a license application. All in all, Parker spent $2,000 to get her license. She started working full time as a real estate agent \u2014 sans side hustles \u2014 the minute she received her license, supporting a local agent, Barry Britt, in foreclosure listings. Parker also sourced her own listings, on Craigslist and through friends of friends, as an independent agent. In 2010, her first year working as a real estate agent, Parker made about $50,000 \u2014 but by 2014, she doubled her income to $100,000.\n\nRunning a six-figure business",

        "body": "An aerial view shows a Philippines Navy vessel that has been grounded since 1999 to assert the nation's sovereignty over the Second Thomas Shoal, a remote South China Sea reef also claimed by China. Jay Directo | Afp | Getty Images\n\nChina has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. \"The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,\" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the Philippines and U.S. released new \"Bilateral Defense Guidelines ,\" reaffirming that an \"armed attack\" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing \" gray zone\" tactics \u2014 coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict \u2014 at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.\n\nU.S. 'gray zone' conundrum\n\nBeijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ \"gray zone\" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. \"The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,\" he said.\n\nGP: Philippine Coast Guard personnel ride a rubber boat past a Chinese Coast Guard vessel during a resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nAn expanded definition of an \"armed attack\" in the treaty could include \"any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,\" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,\" said Heydarian. \"It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,\" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.\n\nAmid a \"sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,\" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an \"armed attack,\" the country needs to \"do more\" than protest China's actions.\n\nA Chinese Coast Guard ship fires a water cannon at Unaizah May 4, a Philippine Navy chartered vessel, conducting a routine resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\n\"The Philippines will continue to resupply the Sierra Madre, and hopefully invest in more outposts in their Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea ... There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,\" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. \"Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,\" he added.\n\nwatch now",

They don't want to sound overly complacent about the risks of inflation,\" Sheets said.\n\n\"But we think the data that the ECB will see by September is inflation [is] continuing to moderate. And I think, for the Fed, inflation is continuing to fall,\" he added.\n\nEuro zone inflation surprised to the upside in May, rising by 0.2 percentage point on a month-on-month basis to hit 2.6%.

        "body": "Spectators watch a race on the River Thames at the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, west of London, on June 30, 2023.\n\nLONDON \u2014 Harmful E.coli bacteria has been discovered at \"alarmingly high\" levels in the U.K.'s River Thames just days before elite rowers are due to compete there for the international Henley Regatta, anti-pollution campaigners have warned.\n\nFrom Tuesday onwards, around 4,000 rowers from across the globe are set to compete in 400 races to qualify for the iconic regatta, which has taken place along the waterway since 1839.\n\nWater quality testing carried out by River Action campaign group ahead of the race, found E.coli bacteria up to 27 times the acceptable limit for bathing water, prompting health concerns following a rise in E.coli cases in the country.\n\nE.coli is a diverse group of bacteria which, while usually harmless, can produce toxins that can cause severe illness.\n\nRiver Action tested water in the Henley Mile \u2014 part of the regatta course outside the Oxfordshire town \u2014 27 times between May 23 and June 25 and found an average of 1,213 E.coli colony forming units (CFUs) per 100ml of water. It warned the levels were \"alarmingly high\" in a Thursday statement.\n\nAnything above 900 CFUs/100ml fails the Environment Agency's inland bathing water quality standards and is deemed a threat to public health, the campaign group said.\n\nMore than half (47%) of readings were found to be above the acceptable limit. The highest recorded was 25,000 CFUs/100ml, more than 27 times higher.\n\nRiver Action also found E.coli levels up to 10 times higher in March tests.\n\nJames Wallace, CEO of River Action, accused the government and Thames Water, which manages water supply in the area, of failing to appropriately manage water hygiene levels.\n\n\"This is a health emergency. The new government must get a grip of the water pollution crisis and ensure that water companies, including Thames Water, invest urgently in upgrading wastewater treatment plants and fix their leaky infrastructure before someone becomes seriously ill, or worse,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThames Water did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, though the BBC reported that it had dubbed the findings \"alarmist\" and said it was monitoring bacteria levels. CNBC also contacted the government's environment agency but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nChair of the Henley Royal Regatta committee of management and former Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave, said the findings were a \"stark reminder\" of the impact of sewage pollution.\n\n\"Our waterways are vitally important to our competitors racing, but also to all those athletes training on a daily basis nationwide,\" he said.\n\nRegatta organizers have advised rowers to cover all cuts and blisters and avoid swallowing river water as thousands of spectators descend on Henley on Thames for the event, which runs until Sunday.\n\nIt comes as the U.K. has faced a rise in E.coli cases. Two people with underlying health conditions died following infection with the Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli strain (STEC). One of the deaths is \"likely linked\" to their STEC infection, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\n\nThat particular strain is thought to have been spread via lettuce leaves within pre-packaged sandwiches.\n\nUKHSA said Thursday that 275 cases of the strain have been confirmed as of June 25, and urged people to watch out for symptoms which can include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever.",

        "title": "Younger generations of Asians are spending big on art",
        "body": "Younger, wealthy shoppers in Asia are splashing their cash on art, according to a longtime collector and senior auction house executive. Nicolas Chow, Sotheby's chairman for Asia, said more than 40% of its buyers of contemporary art are millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), while Gen X (1965 to 1980) are also likely to be big spenders, he said. \"The buyers are increasingly younger. What we've seen actually in 2023 \u2026 Gen X is the most important buy-base actually \u2014 over a million dollars, they dominate the market,\" Chow told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\" Gen Z \u2014 the youngest age group for buyers \u2014 is \"coming in quite strongly,\" he said, adding that he recently saw a 20-year-old buyer acquire a piece in Shanghai to celebrate his graduation. Wealthy millennials in Asia spent a median of $59,785 on art and antiques during the first half of 2023, while for Gen Zers the figure was $56,000, according to the Art Basel & UBS Survey of Global Collecting 2023. Buying at auction \u2014 instead of from a dealer, for example \u2014 is popular with millennials and Gen X collectors globally, according to the survey. The trend appears to be playing out in Asia. At Christie's Hong Kong spring season auction, held between May 25 and June 1, around a quarter of buyers were new to the auction house, and 43% of those were millennials, according to an online release.\n\nA visitor takes a selfie with work by Yoshitomo Nara during Sotheby's Hong Kong spring sales on April 2, 2024. Chen Yongnuo | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nAnd, while the size of the global art market fell 4% last year to around $65 billion, according to the Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report 2024, sales in China rose by 9% in 2023, overtaking the U.K. as the world's second-largest art market. \"Activity surged as post-lockdown buyers snapped up backlogged auction inventories and as Hong Kong's major fairs and exhibitions returned to full-scale programming,\" wrote report author and founder of Arts Economics, Clare McAndrew. For Sotheby's, the rise in younger buyers is driven in part by an increase in online activity. \"During the pandemic, we really sort of developed our digital abilities with live streaming ... And this has really brought in art to the greater communities and allowed us to engage with our buyers across the world,\" Chow said. Younger collectors are keen on newer art forms, with Gen Z collectors having the highest average expenditure on digital art globally \u2014 as well as prints \u2014 of any generation, according to the Survey of Global Collecting 2023.\n\nYoung digital artists\n\nFor Angelle Siyang-Le, director of the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong, artists who work in digital media are becoming more prominent. \"The definition of digital art nowadays has been expanded from simply photography to video art to NFTs to AI-generated art,\" she told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\"\n\n\n\nAn NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain. Sales of art-related NFTs were $1.2 billion in 2023, less than half the $2.9 billion peak in 2021 \u2014 though still significantly higher than 2020 sales, which were $20 million, according to the Art Market Report 2024. \"With the younger generations becoming more and more prominent in the market ... digital artists ... will be the group of artists getting more attention,\" Siyang-Le added. Hong Kong-based artist Mak2 uses a variety of mediums in her work, including Instagram videos. Her 2017 work, \"You Better Watch Out,\" an inflatable, transparent \"snow globe,\" featured floating QR codes that the audience could scan. CCTV cameras filmed people scanning the codes, which linked to a web page that showed the audience looking at the artwork. \"So you are watching yourself being watched,\" Mak2 told CNBC's Art of Appreciation. \"You're not just looking at your phone, you're becom[ing] data circulat[ing] inside the app and being recorded and analyzed,\" she added.\n\nPeople view work at Art Basel Hong Kong, held in March 2024.

        "body": "Iranian women cast their ballots at a polling station during elections to select members of parliament and a key clerical body, in Tehran on March 1, 2024. ATTA KENARE | AFP\n\nIran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash \u2014 and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners \u2014 and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years \u2014 and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.\n\nwatch now\n\nMost of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. \"In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,\" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. \"Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,\" they wrote. \"A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.\"\n\nWho is running?\n\nTwo candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.\n\nWhere the real power lies\n\nIran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks with media after casting his ballot during the Iranian Parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections at the Leadership office in Tehran, Iran, on March 1, 2024.

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "HYDERABAD, India \u2013 Calvary Temple is India's largest church with more than 300,000 members. Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.\n\nMost roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.\n\nAs church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.\n\nBy sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.\n\nThe main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.\n\nHundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.\n\nPastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.\n\n\"I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,\" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.\n\nCalvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nThey have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.\n\n\"God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,\" said Kumar.\n\nPastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.\n\n\"God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.\n\n\"It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,\" said Kumar.\n\nMillions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?\n\n\"Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,\" said Kumar.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.**\n\nThat practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.\n\nNarayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring \u2013 all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.\n\n\"We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,\" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.\n\nNagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.\n\n\"Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,\" Mendem said. \"God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.\"\n\nShe and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.\n\n\"In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,\" Kumar said. \"We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.\"\n\nCalvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.\n\n\"The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,\" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.\n\nMembers also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements \u2013 again, all for free.\n\nIn 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.\n\n\"I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,\" Kumar said.\n\nEach member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.\n\n\"Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,\" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. \"They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.\"\n\nPastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.\n\n\"During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,\" Kumar told CBN News. \"Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.\"\n\nEach month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a \"Night with God\" as members pray for revival.\n\n\"About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.\n\n\"The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,\" Kumar said.\n\nMost attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.\n\nPastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.\n\n\"No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,\" said Kumar. \"It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "A last-minute peace deal could still possibly avert a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.\n\nBy the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.\n\nThat's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, \"Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.\"\n\nHezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.\n\n'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'\n\nAs the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.\n\nHe's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, \"On the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\nVisiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, \"The situation spirals out of control.\"\n\nExuberant Defiance of Terrorism\n\nEven as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.\n\nNimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.\n\nHe told the concert crowd, \u201cOn that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn\u2019t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.\"\n\nThe Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.\n\n'We Will Dance Again!'\n\nBut the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.\n\nAs concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, \"Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.\u201d\n\nNimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, \"In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\n\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "body": "Print this page\n\nA dwindling number of bearish Wall Street strategists are struggling to convince \u201cfanatical\u201d clients that slowing economic growth and excessive hype about artificial intelligence have left the US stock market vulnerable to a sharp downturn.\n\nBanks including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS this month upgraded their end-of-year forecasts for the S&P 500 index, which has hit successive record highs during its surge of about 15 per cent so far this year, driven by a small group of soaring AI stocks.\n\nFaced with a growing number of investors convinced that the rally will continue, the few remaining bearish strategists say their contrarian views are proving an increasingly difficult sell.\n\n\u201cThis rally has been tough and we\u2019re having a hard time convincing [clients] to be bearish,\u201d said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel. \u201cThere\u2019s a wall of money that\u2019s willing to buy the market at any price and embrace fanatical thinking.\n\n\u201cPeople are bubbled up right now, they think the sky is the limit,\u201d added Bannister, who expects a mix of weaker growth and lingering inflation to drag the S&P down roughly 13 per cent from its current level by the end of the year.\n\nBCA Research chief equity strategist Peter Berezin said his preferred leading economic indicators \u201care all pointing to a recession in the next nine months\u201d, but many of his clients see things differently.\n\n\u201cThe soft [economic] landing narrative is so incredibly entrenched that again and again I\u2019m challenged in meetings by clients who say I\u2019m too bearish,\u201d Berezin said.\n\nIn a sign of how some previously-cautious analysts are throwing in the towel, investment bank Evercore ISI last week upgraded its end-of-year S&P forecast from 4,750 \u2014 which implied a small fall in the index for 2024 \u2014 to 6,000. That implies a further gain of almost 10 per cent over the next six months from the current index level of around 5,482 and makes it one of the most bullish banks.\n\nHigh stock valuations are a key point of contention. Bears view the S&P 500\u2019s roughly 25 times trailing price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 which is in the top decile of valuations since 1960 \u2014 as a red flag, arguing that stocks typically only trade at such expensive multiples ahead of sell-offs. But Evercore ISI\u2019s chief equity strategist Julian Emanuel said selling based on high valuations alone \u201chas been an unwise thing to do over the course of history.\n\nWall Street strategists up their end-of-year S&P 500 targets Bank May forecast June forecast Morgan Stanley 4,500 *5,400 Evercore ISI 4,750 6,000 Citigroup 5,100 5,600 Goldman Sachs 5,200 5,600 22V Research 5,250 5,650 UBS 5,400 5,600\n\n\u201cThere have been three equally expensive regimes in the recent past \u2014 1993 to 1995, 1998 to 2000 and 2020 to 2021 \u2014 and in each case the market rallied until we were in real proximity to the [economic] downturn,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\nToday, \u201cthe economy is definitely slowing, the labour market is certainly weakening, but we don\u2019t see anything that screams recession here and now\u201d.\n\nBears have a long history of finding it difficult to hold on to their contrarian views. While staying bearish could cost them their job during lengthy bull runs, capitulating and turning bullish can make them look foolish if the downturn they had been predicting materialises soon afterwards.\n\nTony Dye, nicknamed \u201cDr Doom\u201d for his views on the overvaluation of equities during the late 1990s dotcom bubble, was ejected from Phillips & Drew Fund Management in early 2000, just weeks before the bubble burst. Long-standing hedge fund bear Russell Clark said in 2021 he would shut his fund after losses during the bull market.\n\nBannister and Berezin are not alone in thinking the US equity market may have run too far this time around. Neither are they the most pessimistic: JPMorgan analysts led by chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic believe the S&P 500 will tumble by almost 25 per cent from current levels by year-end.\n\nA cooling labour market, declining home sales and rising consumer delinquencies are among several signals that suggest a recession may be on the horizon, according to Kolanovic, who counts the market\u2019s dependence on chipmaker Nvidia and a few other AI groups as another potential weakness. \u201cRising markets on narrowing breadth has historically been an ominous sign,\u201d he and his team wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\nEarlier this month the bank laid out its glass half-empty take on the economic impact of generative AI. \u201cFor equities to avoid a 20 per cent-plus correction, you have to believe that tech will become a much more meaningful driver of growth for the broad economy in short order,\u201d JPM wrote in a separate note. \u201cWe don\u2019t think its impact on corporate [profit and loss statements] . . . will be that profound so suddenly.\u201d\n\nThe bank recommended clients hold an overweight position in US stocks during the sell-off of 2022 before switching to recommending an underweight position in early 2023. It has stuck with that position ever since, even though the blue-chip index has surged by roughly 42 per cent since the start of that year.\n\n\u201cIf you were bullish in 2022, bearish in 2023 and bearish again in 2024, why in the name of God should anyone listen to you?\u201d said one equity strategist at a mid-tier US investment bank.\n\n\u201cThe intellectual logic, I\u2019m sure, is very sound,\u201d the person added. \u201cBut perma-bears, just as much as perma-bulls, don\u2019t get listened to when their calls don\u2019t work out in the near or medium term.\u201d",

        "body": "\u201cOh, Joe.\u201d\n\nThat gasp, from patrons at a Chicago bar when President Joe Biden first stumbled verbally in his debate with Donald Trump, spoke for a lot of Americans on Thursday night.\n\nIn watch parties, bars, a bowling alley and other venues where people across the country gathered to tune in, Trump supporters, happily, and Biden supporters, in their angst if not dread, seemed to largely agree they had witnessed a lopsided showdown.\n\nBy the end of the 90-plus minutes, some Democrats were saying what partisans say to put the best face on things: It\u2019s still early. One debate doesn\u2019t necessarily sway the nation. Judge him by what he\u2019s done and wants to do, not by how he says things.\n\nBut many were let down.\n\nBiden \u201cjust didn\u2019t have the spark that we needed tonight,\u201d Rosemarie DeAngelus, a Democrat from South Portland, Maine, said from her watch party at Broadway Bowl. Trump, she said, showed \u201cmore spunk or more vigor\u201d even if, in her view, he was telling a pack of lies.\n\nFellow Biden supporter and bowling alley attendee Lynn Miller, from nearby Old Orchard Beach, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody gave Trump an Adderall and I don\u2019t think they gave Joe one.\u201d (The drug is used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Trump seem so coherent,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd I hate to say this, but Joe seemed a little bit off. But I still support him over Trump because Trump lied about every single thing that happened.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters certainly agreed that the difference in energy and coherence between the candidates was striking. Wearing her red MAGA hat at a festive pro-Trump party in the Detroit suburb of Novi, Bonnie Call said of Biden: \u201cHe just cannot think on his feet at all. President Trump is just on.\u201d\n\nIn McAllen, Texas, near the Mexico border, London\u2019s Bar & Grill is normally loud on a day close to the weekend, but many patrons were quiet as they absorbed the debate from TV screens. Here, Biden supporters, Trump supporters and undecided voters mingled.\n\nAmong them, Vance Gonzales, 40, a moderate Democrat, said the debate convinced him that \u201cwe need another Democratic candidate, to be honest, because this is not competitive.\u201d He said of Biden: \u201cHe\u2019s not on point with anything. I think it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nMarco Perez, 53, voted for Biden in the last election and voiced frustration with what he was hearing and seeing. \u201cI want to hear more facts, more action as opposed to more finger-pointing, more accusations or false accusations,\u201d he said.\n\nHis friend Virginia Lopez, sitting with him, came away still not knowing whom she will support in November. She heard snappy but unsatisfying answers from the Republican. \u201cTrump is just deflecting in all the answers and he\u2019s just lying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a real debate.\u201d\n\nBiden? \u201cI just feel like he\u2019s too old,\u201d she said.\n\nSitting up at the bar, Hector Mercado, 72, a veteran wearing a U.S. military beret, was a distinctive patron as he listened intently to the debate. Although he was a Democrat for several years, he switched parties under Ronald Reagan, a Republican.\n\nMercado heard Biden accuse Trump of making derogatory comments about veterans, but it didn\u2019t sway his support for Trump. \u201cYeah, he said a few things bad about veterans at one point back in the early days,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cBut now he\u2019s saying, \u2018No, I back up the veterans and I never had any problems with him. I got a raise in my VA disability when Trump was president.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s performance left him cold. \u201cI think Trump is stronger,\u201d he said, \u201cand Biden is a little weak.\u201d\n\nIn a Tijuana migrant shelter over the border in Mexico, people mainly from southern Mexico who are hoping to apply for asylum in the U.S. watched the debate in folding chairs in front of a screen on the wall.\n\nThe migrants, most of whom have been waiting for months for their appointments in that process, stared blankly at the screen as a Spanish-translated version of the debate played on. They watched an American democratic ritual in motion.\n\nAndrea, who did not give her last name due to threats of violence back home, has lived at the shelter for nine months. Her debate takeaway: \u201cWell, I feel that the people of the United States don\u2019t love Mexicans now.\u201d\n\nAt Hula Hula, a tiki bar in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood, patrons cheered wildly as their city got a mention from Trump \u2014 even if it came up when the Republican was complaining about lawlessness. Biden supporter Amy Pottinger of Seattle said the Democratic president did best when Trump made him angry.\n\n\u201cOnce he started talking about Roe v. Wade, it was like Biden woke up and was here,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same Chicago bar where patrons exclaimed about Biden\u2019s stumbles \u2014 the M Lounge in the South Loop \u2014 the president scored with this zinger to Trump: \u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d the viewers there said.\n\nBut at a Democratic watch party in downtown Atlanta, it was a night of jitters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so nervous, I feel like my kid is going onstage,\u201d Georgia state Sen. Nikki Merritt said early on, patting her stomach as if she had butterflies.\n\nTechnicians struggled with sound and video. During one outage, the crowd chanted \u201cLet\u2019s Go Joe!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to hear Joe Biden talking to the voters and ignoring the crazy man in the room,\u201d said Matthew Wilson, the Georgia Democratic Party\u2019s vice chairman.\n\nBut there was no ignoring the man they called crazy.",

They were reportedly also told that a lack of response within the 72-hour time frame would essentially be translated to giving notice.\n\n\u201cIt was very factual. If you don\u2019t live in these seven metro areas, you either need to move there or give us your stuff and hit the brick,\u201d one affected CX worker told Business Insider.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t respond by Friday, they will assume that we have chosen the severance package and we\u2019ll start that process.\u201d\n\nOther workers told BI that the severance package is generous; however, the proposition feels like they\u2019re being \u201claid off\u201d and they did not know anyone who was considering relocating.\n\nThose who do choose to relocate must do so by Sept. 30 and have been offered $4,000 and extra PTO to help with the move.\n\nPatagonia hasn\u2019t immediately responded to Fortune\u2019s request for comment, however, a company spokesperson told Business Insider that 90 of 255 CX staff in the U.S. were affected and that several employees have already indicated they would relocate.\n\nRelocation ultimatums aren\u2019t common\u2014or without risk\n\nRelocation ultimatums were relatively unheard of before the pandemic. But businesses went on a hiring spree while many professionals were working from home and now many want them back in an office.\n\nAlthough return-to-office mandates generally apply to those within a commutable distance of a company\u2019s vertical tower, a few firms have gone one step further like Patagonia and asked staff to relocate in the name of collaboration.\n\nThe company hopes to bring staff together at the hubs at least once every six weeks for in-person trainings, company gatherings, or Activism Hours.\n\nAmazon employees who were hired (or moved) during the pandemic were similarly told they would have to relocate closer to offices so they could meet the company\u2019s three-day in-person requirement. Meanwhile, the gaming giant Roblox warned workers who can\u2019t make it to the company\u2019s physical office in California that they would have to find another job. Then there\u2019s Walmart, which asked hundreds of employees to relocate to an entirely new city to comply with its RTO mandate.\n\nBut such ultimatums aren\u2019t without risk.\n\nIn reality, professionals have more job options than they once did thanks to hybrid working. Now, research highlights that people aren\u2019t willing to move house for their careers anymore and would even rather endure a \u201csuper commute\u201d for a few days of the week to keep their after-work life in the suburbs.\n\nGrindr\u2019s executive team found out the hard way that staff can call their employer\u2019s bluff. The dating platform lost almost half of its workforce in two weeks, including most of its engineering team, causing the company to reckon with technical issues as a result of its aggressive RTO order.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter\u2019s (now X) operations were once put at risk when more workers than expected chose the latter option in Elon Musk\u2019s call to go \u201chardcore\u201d or quit.",

        "title": "Women like me are missing out on one of the best jobs available today as careers in private equity have a 50% chance of going awry",
        "body": "In the realm of finance, private equity (PE) is particularly male-dominated. In the U.K. and Europe, there are approximately 23% of women in mid-level investor roles, dropping to about 11% for senior-level roles. The U.S. touts similar figures for mid-level investor roles, doing slightly better at 15% for senior-level roles. This gender imbalance is not ideal.\n\nThe power of PE to shape the world through the products and services people use daily is phenomenal: the sector manages $11.7 trillion in assets. More women at the tables where deals are chosen and made will allow more deals to be made with companies led by women. This will get us closer to living in a world that designs products and services that serve women better. Right now, we are stuck in a world where they are designed with biases to the detriment of women users.\n\nMany PE firms also want to attract women. Leading firms have recognized the benefits of a diverse workforce, both in terms of performance and decision-making. They are actively recruiting and promoting women to senior positions, offering mentorship programs, and creating a more inclusive culture. These activities demand a diverse skill set, including analytical prowess, strategic thinking, and effective communication\u2014all qualities that women can bring to the table just as effectively as men. What is more, there is some evidence that institutional investors want more diversity in PE and tend to allocate capital to more diverse PE firms.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t women choosing PE?\n\nPE is still perceived as an unwelcoming field for women. I recently found that these perceptions are correct 50% of the time. Partnering with Level 20 and my colleague Nikita from The Inclusion Initiative at LSE, I undertook a detailed qualitative study that involved one-to-one interviews with 41 women working in mid-level investment roles across Europe. I complemented these interviews with focus groups that involved 51 additional participants from PE.\n\nStrikingly, we found that there is a polarization of cultures within PE. The polarization of cultures is most evident within small and mid-cap PE firms, where women thrive 50% of the time. For large firms, micro-cultures were identified: the experience of the women was driven by the senior leaders and managers to whom they were exposed. Once again, 50% of the time women thrived.\n\nAs for the other 50%? The experiences of these women aligned pretty much with the widespread perception that PE as a sector is horrible. Women were called \u201cpretty,\u201d asked to make coffee, expected to play golf, and asked out on dates by married senior men within their company. They dealt with sexism, misogyny, and micro-aggressions, leading to slower progression and a higher propensity to quit the sector. Despite this most of these women still stated that they loved the content of their work\u2014it was the culture that was giving them sleepless nights and daily nausea.\n\nStill, I couldn\u2019t help being drawn in by the stories of so many women thriving in the sector. These women had advocates who enabled them to get access to deals and networks they otherwise would not have. These women were in environments where they had equal opportunities, visibility, and voice as compared to their men peers. These women did not worry about the unwritten rules that held women back in the other half of the sector. Rather, they had transparency over what it would take to get promoted. Recognizing these patterns in the interview data, caused us to create the ACCELERATE framework. This framework recommends that PE firms seeking to attract, retain, and progress women in the sector focus on advocates, inclusive cultures, and transparency. The framework also lays out clear actions that can be taken by any manager in PE to improve the environment in their firm so it is more attractive to women, regardless of the current culture.\n\nShaking off the impostor syndrome\n\nHaving never fully understood the day-to-day grind in PE, studying the sector also allowed me to de-mystify what a job on a deal team entails. In hindsight, if I could go back in time I might choose PE for my career.\n\nWhen I was finishing my degree in economics at 21, I did not know what PE was. This lack of information about careers in the sector continues to prevail. According to our research, women are less likely than men to be aware of PE as an option. If PE wants to attract women to the sector, women need to know it is a viable option for an amazing career. This means that PE has to do better in schools and universities in getting the word out.\n\nPE must communicate better how interesting a job on a deal team actually is. Very often, those who turn away from investor roles in PE as a career option are frightened by the need to be skilled at financial modeling. This is a mistake. It is pretty easy to get a grip on modeling skills if you shake off imposter syndrome and get some practice. Even if you find financial modeling boring, after a couple of promotions (about 5 years if you get it right), you advance to far more interesting tasks. You need to play a medium-term game that allows you to end up in one of the most interesting jobs available today. From deal sourcing to due diligence to deal structuring to portfolio management to exit strategies, there is an opportunity to get involved in every part of the value chain. If you are successful in PE, you will also get access to coveted board seats in the companies you choose to back.\n\nIt is impossible to ignore the financial perks of PE. The compensation packages are like winning the lottery (well, almost). High salaries, performance-based bonuses, and the wonderful world of carry\u2014it really is a golden pathway to financial security. Early retirement, anyone?\n\nThe positive experiences of 50% of women in our study underline the polarized culture within PE. The research shows that any notion that PE is inherently unsuitable for women is far from accurate. In fact, if a woman chooses the right company, she will be afforded a wealth of opportunities to thrive and succeed.\n\nGiven the positive attitudes of institutional investors towards diversity, I suspect that companies doing things right are setting themselves up for a major competitive advantage. They just need to shake off an outdated image of PE that is being perpetuated by the horrible companies that survive.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

        "body": "It\u2019s hard not to be tempted by Italy\u2019s warm sun, picturesque scenery and ever-uplifting cuisine.\n\nNow, imagine being paid to move to one of the most iconic regions of Tuscany in Italy, where mountains roll over the panorama and there are far fewer people than in Venice or Rome.\n\nIt might sound too good to be true, but the Tuscan authorities kicked off a program in June aimed at just that. The scheme pays people between \u20ac10,000 ($10,700) and \u20ac30,000 ($32,090) for \u201cresidency in the mountains,\u201d the website says.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the intervention is to favor and encourage the repopulation and socio-economic revitalization of mountain areas, acting in contrast to the marginalization of these areas,\u201d the website states.\n\nTuscany has created a \u20ac2.8 million ($3 million) fund to buy and renovate homes in towns with less than 5,000 residents to bolster the rural population in its mountainous municipalities.\n\nSuccessful applicants will then have to make that property their permanent residence.\n\nThe program is open to Italian, EU, and non-EU citizens with a long-term residence permit valid for at least 10 years. Applications for the program close Jul. 27, 2024 at 1 p.m. Tuscany time.\n\nThe scheme in Tuscany marks the latest in a slew of measures by Italian regions to lift their permanent population through lucrative residency programs. This is set against the backdrop of a demographic crisis due to a rapidly aging population in Italy.\n\nThe country is Europe\u2019s third most populous and has the oldest economy with a median age of 48.4 years, according to Eurostat data. Italy also has the highest share of the population aged 80 years and above. In effect, that means fewer births than deaths and demography skewed to higher ages just as life expectancy climbs due to advancements in medicine and healthcare services.\n\nThat\u2019s a cause for concern for policymakers as it means overburdened social benefits such as pensions and fewer young people paying taxes to provide for them. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni warned in 2022 that Italy is \u201cdestined to disappear\u201d if the plunging birth rate isn\u2019t addressed\u2014but she argues that immigration isn\u2019t the only way to do it.\n\nA stony house in one of Tuscany\u2019s hilly towns, Pitigliano. Frank Bienewald\u2014LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nResidency schemes are a way to lure people from Italy and its neighboring countries to cash in and make a more remote part of Italy their home. This will drive the local economy, improve infrastructure, and boost the population in regions like the rural side of Tuscany.\n\nIn a similar program two years ago, the Sardinian government said it would pay \u20ac15,000 per person in grants to move to the island\u2014as long as the town had less than 3,000 occupants. A number of other villages in Italy have started offering similar opportunities.\n\nAnother example of Italy\u2019s innovative schemes is the \u20ac1 houses that were first offered in the 2010s.\n\nThe catch? These programs offer run-down property for cheap so that new residents can renovate what would otherwise be derelict houses. Some of the villages where these programs are offered are off the beaten path and have a population of only a couple of thousands at best. But that\u2019s part of the appeal for many looking to catch a break from the crowds and chaos of the urban areas.\n\nIt might still be early to gauge whether these programs jumpstart local economies and create jobs. But there are early signs in some towns that cheap house sale programs have generated more income streams among local builders and designers, Euro News reported.\n\nWhile the long-term effects remain to be seen, at the very least, people will get a once-in-a-lifetime wildcard to move to Italy out of it.",

        "title": "Jamie Dimon says schools are making his job harder by not giving students the proper training to enter the working world",
        "body": "The leader of America\u2019s biggest bank wants to see schools doing more to bring students up to pace with the working world, instead of leaving it to businesses to bridge the gap.\n\nJamie Dimon has long been an advocate of getting younger people into well-paid positions, and believes schools should be monitored on whether their students land careers after they graduate as opposed to whether they go to college.\n\nThis week Dimon\u2014who oversees more than 240,000 employees worldwide\u2014doubled down on that stance.\n\n\u201cBusinesses have to hire a lot of people and they have to train them, so when the school system doesn\u2019t do it, it makes this harder for companies,\u201d he told Axios in an interview released Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat you need in a lot of these things is, certificates and training that get them the good job.\u201d\n\nDimon\u2014who was paid a record $36 million for his work in 2023\u2014also pushed back on the notion that his work to get younger people and underrepresented communities into the workplace is a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) exercise.\n\nThe Harvard Business School graduate was speaking in relation to his position as the executive chairman of the New York Jobs CEO Council\u2014a coalition of some of the largest employers in the Big Apple.\n\nAlso on the board is Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nA father of three, Dimon rejected the implication that his work on the council was linked to DEI\u2014a topic which has split opinion among the nation\u2019s top CEOs.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase chairman said he was \u201cnot interested in labels\u201d and added the jobs council had \u201cnothing to do with DEI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has to do with the system isn\u2019t working and needs to be fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is part of our job [as CEOs and companies] to lift up society. You call that whatever you want\u2026 If we leave behind whole parts of society, we\u2019re making a huge mistake for our country.\u201d\n\nJudging school quality\n\nDimon\u2019s sentiments echo thoughts he shared earlier this year about what factors should be considered when establishing whether a school is of good quality.\n\nHe told Indianapolis-based WISH-TV in March: \u201cIf you look at kids they gotta be educated to get jobs. Too much focus in education has been on graduating college\u2026 It should be on jobs. I think the schools should be measured on, did the kids get out and get a good job?\u201d\n\nDimon pointed out that a 17-year-old bank teller could make $40,000 a year, adding: \u201cAnd if you happen to have a family at 18 or whatever, you get $20,000 in medical benefit for your family. You can be a welder, you can be a coder, you could be cyber you could be automotive\u2014all of those jobs are $40,000 to $60,000, $70,000 a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cJobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Dimon repeated. \u201cThere are a lot of efforts taking place around the country but I think we\u2019ve fallen behind as a nation.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nIt seems students themselves are also thinking differently about what they want to get out of their education.\n\nEducation data specialists National Clearing House reported in January that undergraduate enrollment grew 1.2% in the fall of 2023\u2014the first time since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBut within that picture is significant growth in vocational subjects\u2014courses designed to help students learn in a practical way to prepare them for a skills-based role.\n\nThe database reported that at community colleges with a high vocational program focus, enrollment grew 16% in the same period, bringing them above fall 2019 levels.\n\nAs Sam Pillar, co-founder and CEO at Jobber wrote for Fortune earlier this month: \u201cHomes and other infrastructure are getting older. Today, the median owner-occupied home in the U.S. is 40 years old, which means there\u2019s a growing need for repairs, maintenance, and remodeling of the aging housing stock.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, skilled workers are retiring, and there aren\u2019t enough young people coming into the trades to take their place\u2026 This leads to delays in service and drives up the cost for consumers. The labor shortage is a major problem but also a massive opportunity for ambitious young people to come in and fill the gap. Thankfully, we\u2019re seeing Gen Z show an interest in seizing this opportunity.\u201d",

        "body": "Nearly 200 people have been charged in a sweeping nationwide crackdown on health care fraud schemes with false claims topping $2.7 billion, the Justice Department said on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced the charges against doctors, nurse practitioners and others across the U.S. accused of a variety of scams, including a $900 million scheme in Arizona targeting dying patients.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company,\u201d Garland told reporters. \u201cIf you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nIn the Arizona case, prosecutors have accused two owners of wound care companies of accepting more than $330 million in kickbacks as part of a scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare for amniotic wound grafts, which are dressings to help heal wounds.\n\nNurse practitioners were pressured to apply the wound grafts to elderly patients who didn\u2019t need them, including people in hospice care, the Justice Department said. Some patients died the day they received the grafts or within days, court papers say.\n\nIn less than two years, more than $900 million in bogus claims were submitted to Medicare for grafts that were used on fewer than 500 patients, prosecutors said.\n\nThe owners of the wound care companies, Alexandra Gehrke and Jeffrey King, were arrested this month at the Phoenix airport as they were boarding a flight to London, according to court papers urging a judge to keep them behind bars while they await trial. An attorney for Gehrke declined to comment, and a lawyer for King didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press.\n\nAuthorities allege Gehrke and King, who got married this year, knew charges were coming and had been preparing to flee. At their home, authorities found a book titled \u201cHow To Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace,\u201d according to court papers. In one of their bags packed for their flight, there was a book titled \u201cCriminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive The System,\u201d the papers say.\n\nGehrke and King lived lavishly off the scheme, prosecutors allege, citing luxury cars, a nearly $6 million home and more than $520,000 in gold bars, coins and jewelry. Officials seized more than $52 million from Gehrke\u2019s personal and business bank accounts after her arrest, prosecutors say.\n\nIn total, 193 people \u2014 including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners, and other licensed medical professionals \u2014 were charged in a series of separate cases brought over about two weeks in the nationwide health care fraud sweep. Authorities seized more than $230 million in cash, luxury cars and other assets. The Justice Department carries out these sweeping health care fraud efforts periodically to help deter other potential wrongdoers.\n\nIn another scheme targeting Native Americans, phony sober living homes were set up promising addiction treatment. Claims were then submitted for services that were never actually performed, officials said.\n\nAnother case alleges a scheme in Florida to distribute misbranded HIV drugs. Prosecutors say drugs were bought on the black market and resold to unsuspecting pharmacies, which then provided the medications to patients.\n\nSome patients were given bottles that contained different drugs than the label showed. One patient ended up unconscious for 24 hours after taking what he was led to believe was his HIV medication but was actually an anti-psychotic drug, prosecutors say.",

        "title": "A South Korean tycoon\u2019s $1 billion divorce settlement could spur a shake-up of the country\u2019s second-biggest conglomerate",
        "body": "SK Inc. has a problem: the second-biggest conglomerate in South Korea is too big after a $21 billion acquisition spree.\n\nChairman Chey Tae-won is meeting top executives controlling $240 billion worth of assets from artificial-intelligence chip supplier, to mobile carrier and battery maker, Friday. The results may kick off the biggest shake-up of the group since he took over more than two decades ago, analysts said.\n\nA six-year acquisition spree has burdened the group with 170 trillion won ($123 billion) of debt by one estimate, just when crown jewel SK Hynix Inc. and its affiliates are about to embark on record investments to capitalize on AI memory-chip demand. The stakes are personal for Chey too as he needs to find $1 billion for a divorce settlement. Investors expect a slew of mergers and asset sales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking pretty bad for SK,\u201d said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate research firm Leaders Index in Seoul. \u201cEvery unit under SK Inc. went on a wild shopping spree to expand its size in the past six, seven years, and those excessive acquisitions have now made the group unmanageable, while the chairman is engulfed in a divorce.\u201d\n\nChey will host the meeting by video conference from the U.S., while cousin Chey Chang-won leads a consultative committee called SK Supex. Reorganizing the portfolio and seeking \u201cquality growth\u201d will be the key agenda, SK said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe executives will also discuss how to improve the battery and biotechnology businesses among others in the two-day retreat, SK said. Chair Chey controls about 18% of SK Inc., which directs more than 200 SK firms through a web of cross-shareholdings. The group\u2019s foundation is traced back to 1953.\n\nMarket expectations for a restructuring have been growing since the Seoul High Court ordered 63 year-old Chey to pay the country\u2019s biggest-known divorce settlement last month. SK Inc.\u2019s stock surged by more than 20% over two days after the judgment on bets the company will boost its stock price to help the chairman.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue for the entire SK affiliates, I think, is how they can come up with the chairman\u2019s divorce bill payment,\u201d said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global PTE. in Singapore.\n\nAmong the possible deals for the 20 listed companies in the group is a merger between energy-related units SK Innovation Co. and SK E&S Co. Combining them will help shore up the balance sheet of loss-making battery maker SK On Co., which is owned by SK Innovation.\n\nSelling off assets at SK Innovation, or looking for cornerstone investors before attempting to list SK On may be other options, according to Shin Hoyong, a senior credit analyst at NICE Investors Service Co.\n\nLocal media have also reported on other potential deals, including the sale of a company private jet. Seoul Economic Daily also said Thursday that the group is seeking a merger of SK Square Co. and SK Networks Co.\n\nThat will bring in cash after a series of failed attempts for initial public offerings of units such as 11Street Co. The group has spent a net 29 trillion won on deals, while also investing 148 trillion won to build up manufacturing capacity for chips and electric-vehicle batteries in the past six years, NICE Investors estimates.\n\nSK Inc. has been one of the nation\u2019s most acquisitive companies with the highest number of affiliates, which doubled in the past six years, according to the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The dealmaking spree though has led in some cases to units competing against each other, Shin said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good news for minority shareholders that the group is financially restructuring and restructuring its governance,\u201d said Roh Jongwon, chief investment officer at Infinity Global Asset Management in Seoul. \u201cIf the shareholder value is increased, Chey can split a smaller portion out of his stock holdings to his estranged wife.\u201d",

        "body": "The longer you stay at an organization, the more Slack channels you get wrapped up in, and the harder it is to eliminate the noise. Even Fortune isn\u2019t immune to this build-up of channels and the platform\u2019s infamous clicking noise, with writers engaging in chats covering everything from breaking news to local food recommendations and football reactions.\n\nLooking after Slack can become a job in itself. However, as the messaging group finds ways to incorporate AI and reduce busy work, users are now forced to contend with how they spend their newly freed-up time.\n\nAI creates a time dilemma\n\nSlack AI reduces the increasingly laborious task of searching the messaging app for important information. The software includes a \u201crecap\u201d function, which gives workers a breakdown of the messages coming their way and prioritizes what matters most.\n\nThe group\u2019s customers, which include tech giants like OpenAI, Spotify, and Uber, are also streamlining their workflows through integrations with other platforms like the work management app Asana.\n\nAI is being used in different ways across Europe, too.\n\nSlack CEO Denise Dresser, who is seven months into her tenure at the Salesforce-owned messaging app, cited a Workforce Labs study that shows U.K. users are taking advantage of its writing assistant feature while French users are using it for summarization.\n\nGermany is the biggest user of AI, with 36% of desk workers operating the tech. Workers in the country are more regularly automating their work than workers in other European nations.\n\nThe early results indicate that the drive for automation is paying off. Slack says its AI tool, Slack AI, saved users 97 minutes a week of administrative time.\n\nBut that has created a new problem: many workers aren\u2019t sure what to do with their extra time.\n\n\u201cThey were still focusing on the work of work, which means we haven\u2019t quite made the operational and mindset shift to begin to do new things,\u201d Dresser told Fortune, reflecting on the Workforce Labs study.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the opportunity when I meet with executives and when we talk about the future of AI, not only do we strongly believe that you need to have a platform that is a command center for work powered by AI that\u2019s driving efficiency, but that you also have to think about the operating model change that you will drive as a leader.\u201d\n\nThe findings point to the next big debate on how AI will augment work, replace roles, and potentially create new ones.\n\nThere is also the debate about whether a five-day week will eventually become obsolete thanks to AI, giving users the option to either take more leisure time or simply work more.\n\nDresser wants to use her free time to speak with clients and is optimistic that AI will continue to liberalize employees\u2019 workflows.\n\n\u201cI personally think it\u2019s going to be one of the single biggest augmenters to human productivity that we\u2019ve seen, and I think that it\u2019s going to really unlock human productivity,\u201d Dresser says.\n\n\u201cIt will probably create more jobs. We may end up with new jobs, and I think that\u2019s going to be exciting.\u201d",

        "title": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang plays down competition worries as key supplier disappoints with subdued expectations for AI chip sales",
        "body": "Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips, CEO Jensen Huang told investors, even as rivals push to cut into his market share and one of Nvidia\u2019s major suppliers gave a subdued forecast for AI chip sales.\n\nEveryone from OpenAI to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla rely on Nvidia semiconductors to run their large language or computer vision models. The roll out of Nvidia\u2019s \u201cBlackwell\u201d system later this year will only cement that lead, Huang said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\n\nUnveiled in March, Blackwell is the next generation of AI training processors to follow its flagship \u201cHopper\u201d line of H100 chips\u2014one of the most prized possessions in the tech industry fetching prices in the tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\n\u201cThe Blackwell architecture platform likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,\u201d Huang said.\n\nNvidia briefly eclipsed Microsoft and Apple this month to become the world\u2019s most valuable company in a remarkable rally that has fueled much of this year\u2019s gains in the S&P 500 index. At more than $3 trillion, Huang\u2019s company was at one point worth more than entire economies and stock markets, only to suffer a record loss in market value as investors locked in profits.\n\nYet as long as Nvidia chips continue to be the benchmark for AI training, there\u2019s little reason to believe the longer-term outlook is cloudy and here the fundamentals continue to look robust.\n\nOne of Nvidia\u2019s key advantages is a sticky AI ecosystem known as CUDA, short for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Much like how everyday consumers are loath to switch from their Apple iOS device to a Samsung phone using Google Android, an entire cohort of developers have been working with CUDA for years and feel so comfortable there is little reason to consider using another software platform. Much like the hardware, CUDA effectively has become a standard of its own.\n\n\u201cThe Nvidia platform is broadly available through every major cloud provider and computer maker, creating a large and attractive base for developers and customers, which makes our platform more valuable to our customers,\u201d Huang added on Wednesday.\n\nMicron\u2019s in-line guidance for next quarter revenue not enough for bulls\n\nThe AI trade did take a recent hit after memory chip supplier Micron Technology, a supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to companies like Nvidia, forecast fiscal fourth quarter revenue would only match market expectations of around $7.6 billion.\n\nShares in Micron plunged 7%, underperforming by a large margin a slight gain in the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nIn the past, Micron and its Korean rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have seen cyclical boom and busts common to the memory chip market, long considered a commodity business when compared with logic chips such as graphic processors.\n\nBut excitement has surged as demand for its chips needed for AI training. Micron\u2019s stock more than doubled over the past 12 months, meaning investors have already priced in much of management\u2019s predicted growth.\n\n\u201cThe guidance was basically in line with expecations and in the AI hardware world if you guide in line that\u2019s considered a slight disappointment,\u201d says Gene Munster, a tech investor with Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cMomentum investors just didn\u2019t see that incremental reason to be more positive about the story.\u201d\n\nAnalysts closely track demand for high bandwidth memory as a leading indicator for the AI industry because it is so crucial for solving the biggest economic constraint facing AI training today\u2014the issue of scaling.\n\nHBM chips address scaling problem in AI training\n\nCosts crucially do not rise in line with a model\u2019s complexity\u2014the number of parameters it has, which can number into the billions\u2014but rather grow exponentially. This results in diminishing returns in efficiency over time.\n\nEven if revenue grows at a consistent rate, losses risk ballooning into the billions or even tens of billions a year as a model gets more advanced. This threatens to overwhelm any company that doesn\u2019t have a deep-pocketed investor like Microsoft capable of ensuring an OpenAI can still \u201cpay the bills\u201d, as CEO Sam Altman phrased it recently.\n\nA key reason for the diminishing returns is the growing gap between the two factors that dictate AI training performance. The first is a logic chip\u2019s raw compute power\u2014as measured by FLOPS, a type of calculation per second\u2014and the second is the memory bandwidth needed to quickly feed it data\u2014often expressed in millions of transfers per second, or MT/s.\n\nSince they work in tandem, scaling one without the other simply leads to waste and cost inefficiency. That\u2019s why FLOPS utilization, or how much of the compute can actually be brought to bear, is a key metric when judging the cost efficiency of AI models.\n\nSold out through the end of next year\n\nAs Micron points out, data transfer rates have been unable to keep pace with rising compute power. The resulting bottleneck, often referred to as the \u201cmemory wall\u201d is a leading cause for today\u2019s inherent inefficiency when scaling AI training models.\n\nThat explains why the U.S. government focused heavily on memory bandwidth when deciding which specific Nvidia chips needed to be banned from export to China in order to weaken Beijing\u2019s AI development program.\n\nOn Wednesday, Micron said its HBM business was \u201csold out\u201d all the way through the end of the next calendar year, which trails its fiscal year by one quarter, echoing similar comments from Korean competitor SK Hynix.\n\n\u201cWe expect to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in FY24 and multiple [billions of dollars] in revenue from HBM in FY25,\u201d Micron said on Wednesday.",
        "summary": "Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips, CEO Jensen Huang told investors, even as rivals push to cut into his market share and one of Nvidia\u2019s major suppliers gave a subdued forecast for AI chip sales.\nOne of Nvidia\u2019s key advantages is a sticky AI ecosystem known as CUDA, short for Compute Unified Device Architecture.\nBut excitement has surged as demand for its chips needed for AI training.\nA key reason for the diminishing returns is the growing gap between the two factors that dictate AI training performance.\nThe resulting bottleneck, often referred to as the \u201cmemory wall\u201d is a leading cause for today\u2019s inherent inefficiency when scaling AI training models.",

And that dependence on chip imports, restricted by a U.S. ban, could now be putting China\u2019s tech sector at a disadvantage in the race to dominate AI.\n\nChinese tech firms are rationing the use of their AI services because a lack of computing power, caused from a shortage of chips, reports The Information.\n\nOne firm, the live-streaming platform Kuaishou, had to limit the number of people who could use the test version of Kling, its text-to-video model, to avoid running short of computing capacity. The company used Nvidia chips, like the A800, to train its model.\n\nAI startup Moonshot AI, most recently valued at $3 billion, is also warning users of its popular chatbot that computing power may be insufficient during peak hours.\n\nAlibaba, Baidu, and ByteDance\u2014all of which offer large language model applications\u2014are telling corporate customers that need heavy usage to wait in line, according to The Information.\n\nKuaishou, Moonshot AI, Alibaba and Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A ByteDance spokesperson said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket rumors.\u201d\n\nU.S. chip controls have an effect\n\nChinese companies are rushing to create their own generative AI applications to get ahead in the country\u2019s fiercely-competitive consumer internet sector. Yet companies running these applications will need access to processors that can power them.\n\nThe U.S. places strict export controls on the sale of AI-related chips, like those made by Nvidia, to China.\n\nChinese companies have previously warned that the export ban was affecting their business. Alibaba blamed U.S. export controls when it abandoned its plan to spin off its cloud computing unit last November. At the time, the e-commerce company said the restrictions \u201cmay materially and adversely affect\u201d its ability to serve customers.\n\nAs non-Chinese firms scramble to get their hands on new Nvidia chips, Chinese companies are instead running through their stockpiled inventory, as Biden administration rules effectively cut off China\u2019s access to high-end AI chips made by companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm.\n\nWhile Nvidia and other chipmakers are working on new products that comply with U.S. rules, Chinese companies are reportedly not keen on these watered-down chips.\n\nChinese firms like Huawei are now working on developing domestically-produced AI chips, but it\u2019s still uncertain whether the industry can make high-end semiconductors at scale. U.S. export controls also bar the export of advanced chipmaking tools to China, and Washington is reportedly pressing allies like the Netherlands and Japan to tighten controls further by halting maintenance services as well.",

Borrowing costs soared and Russia's war in Ukraine exacerbated a rise in prices of fuel and food.\n\nMembers of the Bolivian army guard the entrance to Plaza Murillo while President Luis Arce \"denounced the irregular mobilisation\" of some units of the country's army in La Paz, Bolivia on June 26, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters\n\n\"There are a lot of governments around the world all facing the pain, delayed fiscal pain, from the interest rate hikes that we've seen in recent years\" said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy with FIM Partners, which invests in emerging market debt.\n\n\"It's not a surprise that the country [Kenya] might reach a breaking point.\"\n\nAt least 23 people died in Kenya as protests spiralled from online condemnations of the tax hikes into mass rallies demanding a political overhaul.\n\n\"It is not just the taxes,\" said Mary Ngigi, a 37-year-old clothing company worker in Kenya, on why she was protesting.\n\n\"When you go to the hospitals, there is no medicine. When you go to the schools, there are no infrastructures.\"\n\nAnger spreading\n\nTurmoil is spreading. In Nigeria, workers protesting rising fuel and food costs caused a nationwide power outage, and leaders face rising subsidy costs despite tripling petrol prices last year.\n\nAngola is also trying to cut subsidies, while Egypt is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a slew of spending cuts and reforms that could cause more pain for citizens reeling from record-high inflation above 30 percent.\n\nRisk intelligence firm Verisk Maplecroft warned that more subsidy cuts or tax hikes could serve as a trigger for unrest.\n\nArgentina was roiled by huge general strikes in May against painful austerity measures and planned reforms by libertarian President Javier Milei, whose cost-cutting drive cheered investors but hammered the real economy.\n\nRising borrowing costs mean debt service gobbles a growing chunk of revenues. This puts pressure on countries, including Kenya, to raise taxes and cut spending.\n\nIn 2023, a record 54 developing countries, equivalent to 38 percent of the total, allocated 10 percent or more of government revenues to interest payments, with nearly half of them in Africa, according to a report from UN Trade and Development agency UNCTAD.\n\nMultilateral banks and political risk firms have warned of a ticking time bomb for some time.\n\nWhile debt relief efforts had centred on the poorest nations with solvency problems, and rightly so according to the World Bank, not enough had been done for lower middle-income countries facing temporary liquidity pressures in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without action, 2024 will see a further rise in debt vulnerability \u2014 potentially leading to reversals in development outcomes,\" World Bank senior managing director Axel van Trotsenburg warned.\n\nRising pain\n\nKenya, like others, borrowed heavily in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were low -- and China was splashing cash via its Belt and Road initiative to lend to emerging markets worldwide.\n\nOver the past 20 years Kenya amassed some $82 billion of debt to build roads, railways and factories.\n\nBut not all ambitious projects were completed, and many Kenyans felt they had not benefited, while a slew of corruption scandals spurred allegations that elites enriched themselves.\n\n\"There is no cut on corruption,\" Boniface Mwangi, a prominent social justice activist in Kenya told Reuters. \"We have no problem paying debt, but...what did you do with that money that you borrowed?\"\n\nRuto has said he is waging a war on corruption and has called for those responsible for graft to be prosecuted.\n\nKenya managed to avoid default by issuing more debt earlier this year - but at a punishing interest rate above 10 percent. After this week's protest, the country's bond prices slid again.\n\nRead: Ethiopia defaults on Eurobond repayment\n\nTo keep crucial IMF cash coming, Ruto must find a way to balance the books.\n\n\"Kenya's government has a budget, and cash is not endless - so they need to prioritise,\" said Lutz Roehmeyer at Capitulum Asset Management.\n\nThe IMF, which warned Kenya to reverse \"fiscal slippage\", did not comment on whether it was asking for too much, but said in a statement that it was \"closely monitoring the situation.\"\n\nFor Ruto -- and other leaders struggling to tame debt -- the path forward is far less clear after this week.",

        "title": "Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: An exploration of its potential",
        "body": "Kisspeptins, a family of compounds encoded by the KISS1 gene, have garnered significant interest in the scientific community due to their intriguing potential in various physiological processes. Among these, Kisspeptin-10, a decapeptide derived from the cleavage of the primary kisspeptin precursor, has emerged as a particularly notable molecule.\n\nThis article explores the potential functions and mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10 in biological systems, emphasising its hypothesised influence in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, and tumor suppression.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Structural and biochemical characteristics\n\nKisspeptin-10, consisting of ten amino acids, is the shortest active form of the kisspeptins. Studies suggest that its structure allows it to bind effectively to the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54 (also known as KISS1R).\n\nThis receptor-ligand interaction is crucial for the peptide's biological activity.\n\nResearch indicates that the binding of Kisspeptin-10 to GPR54 may trigger a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways, primarily involving phospholipase C and the subsequent release of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These events may lead to an influence in intracellular calcium levels and the activation of protein kinase C, which are critical for the downstream impacts observed in various tissues.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Reproductive physiology\n\nOne of the most extensively studied potential roles of Kisspeptin-10 is in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might act as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion.\n\nThis, in turn, may influence the secretion of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones are pivotal for regulating gonadal function, including steroid and gametogenesis.\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 might play a critical role in the onset of puberty. It has been theorized that the increased expression of Kisspeptin and its receptor during this developmental stage might be a key trigger for the reactivation of the HPG axis, leading to the maturation of the reproductive system.\n\nMoreover, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to regulate reproductive processes, potentially modulating the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: metabolism\n\nBeyond its reproductive functions, Kisspeptin-10 is also speculated to significantly affect metabolic processes. A growing body of data suggests that kisspeptins might be involved in regulating energy homeostasis.\n\nKisspeptin-10 is expressed in several regions of the brain that are known to be critical for metabolic control, including the hypothalamus. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might influence appetite and food intake by interacting with other neuropeptides and hormones involved in energy balance, such as leptin and insulin.\n\nFurthermore, studies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might play a role in glucose homeostasis. Preliminary research indicates that Kisspeptin-10 might increase insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.\n\nThese properties suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have potential implications for managing metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, although more extensive studies are needed to fully understand these mechanisms.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Tumors\n\nAnother intriguing aspect of Kisspeptin-10 is its potential role in tumor suppression. The KISS1 gene was initially identified as a metastasis suppressor gene in melanoma cells. Subsequent research has indicated that Kisspeptin-10 and its receptor might inhibit the metastatic spread of various cancers, including breast, prostate, and gastric.\n\nIt is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10's anti-tumorigenic properties might be mediated through several mechanisms. For instance, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to cease cell migration and invasion by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that affect the extracellular matrix and facilitate tumor metastasis. Kisspeptin-10 might induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, contributing to its potential anti-cancer potential.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Cardiovascular and neuroprotective research\n\nEmerging data suggests that Kisspeptin-10 might also have protective parts in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the cardiovascular context, Kisspeptin-10 is expressed in the heart and blood vessels and is theorized to influence vascular tone and blood pressure regulation.\n\nStudies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have vasoconstrictive impacts, which might be mediated through its interaction with the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.\n\nIn the nervous system, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to exert neuroprotective impacts. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might protect neurons from excitotoxic damage and oxidative stress, potentially by activating survival pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. These properties might have implications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, although further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Conclusion\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 is a multifaceted peptide with a wide range of potential biological functions. Its possible roles in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, tumor suppression, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection highlight its importance in maintaining organismal homeostasis.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10, many aspects of its functions and implications remain speculative and warrant further investigation.

        "body": "Throughout history, gold trading has solidified as a pillar of investment methods, providing a stable haven within the turbulence of unpredictable economic conditions.\n\nEntering the world of gold trading might seem intimidating to novices at first, but with a firm understanding of its fundamentals, one can embark on this rewarding journey with confidence.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on the mysterious world of gold trading, this article provides traders who are new to the game with helpful advice and methods.\n\nUnderstanding the basics of gold trading\n\nBuying and selling gold with the intention of making a profit is the core of the art of gold trading. In contrast to long-term gold storage under your mattress, trading is all about riding the waves of momentary price fluctuations.\n\nThere are several methods to become involved in this vibrant market: you may invest in gold futures, horde real gold like a pirate with coins and bars, ride along on gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), or even mine stocks.\n\nEvery route has its own set of hazards and tricks, so it pays to be aware of the terrain and choose your poison carefully depending on what makes your heart race and how much danger you can take.\n\nTechnical analysis: The foundation of gold trading\n\nIn gold trading, technical analysis is similar to detective work. It entails closely examining price charts to look for hints about potential future moves. These include determining trend lines, head and shoulders or double top patterns, and support and resistance levels.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and moving averages are examples of indicators that may be used as research instruments to provide information about possible price movements and market sentiment.\n\nGaining proficiency in technical analysis enables traders to accurately interpret market signals and make well-informed judgments for successful trading strategies.\n\nThe role of fundamental analysis\n\nWhen it comes to gold trading, fundamental research is akin to penetrating the rich past concealed below the glossy exterior.\n\nFinding the economic statistics, central bank policies, and international political dramas that drive up gold prices is the key. For example, be prepared for a stronger dollar and a possible decline in gold prices when the Fed suggests rising interest rates.\n\nThis is because gold loses value when other currencies gain value. Traders may anticipate changes in the market and adjust their strategies to optimize their earnings by analyzing these intricately linked narratives.\n\nDeveloping a trading strategy\n\nThe secret to being an expert in gold trading is developing a solid trading plan. It's similar to planning a route: decide on the appropriate vehicle (trading instruments), pack for your comfort level (risk tolerance), and know where you're going (defined goals).\n\nManaging risk is your compass, whether you're swinging slowly for a few days or running through the day. Put stop-loss orders in place to avoid risk and profit as soon as your goal comes into view. Adhere to your strategy religiously, and you will witness the glittering success of your trading career.\n\nUtilising trading platforms and tools\n\nFor astute traders, modern trading platforms are a veritable treasure of tools and resources. Imagine having access to technical analysis tools, news feeds, and real-time price charts at your fingertips.\n\nDemo accounts are similar to a practice run; they are ideal for novices to see the waters without jumping in too deep. Additionally, you may trade anytime, anywhere with mobile trading apps, which function like a portable trading desk. When you have these tools at your disposal, you're dealing wisely rather than merely for gold.\n\nPsychological aspects of trading\n\nManaging your emotions is just as important to success in the gold market as analyzing data. Imagine this: The fluctuations in the market have the power to arouse greed and anxiety more quickly than a rollercoaster.\n\nYou need a well-thought-out plan and a disciplined approach to stay consistent. Consider it as your mental fitness regimen, similar to preparing for a marathon: mindfulness and stress reduction. By maintaining your composure, you're learning the skill of emotional intelligence in trading, not only trading gold.\n\nLegal and regulatory considerations\n\nKeeping your capital secure and healthy is just as important as avoiding errors while navigating the legal environment of gold dealing. Consider it like being aware of the traffic laws prior to embarking on an exciting journey.\n\nA plethora of bureaucracy exists in regulations, ranging from taxation and reporting to trading limitations and all in between. Remain educated and, when in doubt, get advice. By abiding by the regulations, you not only safeguard your nest egg but also contribute to the proper operation of the financial system.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nStarting a gold trading business is similar to going on a treasure hunt: it's thrilling and may be quite profitable.\n\nYou'll be able to confidently negotiate the ups and downs of the gold market by grasping the fundamentals, fusing technical expertise with fundamental understanding, and developing a solid trading strategy.\n\nIt's important to maintain composure while emotions are running high in addition to crunching data.",

        "body": "Days before the gloom - the water cannons, and the young protesters shot in the head - Ann Kinuthia-Otieno, Chief Executive of Airtel Money walks onto the rooftop of Emara Ole Sereni in Nairobi. A petite lady, you can immediately tell she\u2019s (to use an apt analogy of the moment) a bullet; straight-shooting, driven, and determined.\n\nShe left Absa Bank as a head of products to run Airtel\u2019s mobile business after it split from Airtel Networks a few years ago to operate as a standalone business. And she comes at a tough time to do business\u2014hell, tough time to just be alive\u2014as a challenger brand. Even more daunting is that she faces a herculean task in the form of mobile money dominance.\n\nNonetheless, not one to complain, Ann\u2019s been working her hide off. Over time, she has tripled the daily transaction limits and significantly reduced its pay bill, bulk payments, and wallet-to-bank charges. The subscribers of Airtel Mobile Money have gone up.\n\n\u201cToday people don\u2019t think much about Airtel Money, but one day they will.\u201d She promises. \u201cWe have covered good ground but the runaway is still long.\u201d\n\n[Earlier, we were discussing parenting before the interview officially commenced.]\n\nYou never know immediately the impact of your parenting until much later...\n\nThere is something growing up that influenced the person that you are today. And these things can either be taken positively or not. Generally, you never know, as a parent, if your decisions were the right ones...\n\nUntil the end\u2026\n\nUntil the end. But again, I think there are cues that sometimes we don't take in or choose to ignore. So, for instance, I was in boarding school with my sister with whom I shared a birthday, the same month, same date, but we are two years apart. She's my elder. We were in State House Girls High School and my parents, for some reason, used to visit us and bring things in odd numbers for us to share. It was frustrating because if you bring seven items, someone will get less. But they let us figure it out ourselves. What that taught us is about sharing, being fair. But it didn\u2019t come easy because you know how siblings can get. When I think about where my sense of fairness came from, it's from there.\n\nWhat do you find harder; parenting or leadership?\n\nParenting. With children you have the pressure of creating a legacy, an impact that has implications on generations to come. It\u2019s a big responsibility. The corporate world is different in that if I leave this job tomorrow, nobody will care about me. There will be someone else doing my job. With your children, it\u2019s a different ball game because everything matters and it will shape their future.\n\nWhat are you struggling with today?\n\nMy struggle today is Airtel Money. It\u2019s a challenger brand that I need to grow. My late dad taught me a very important lesson that has stayed with me: whatever it is that you do, give it your very best so that nobody can come and do it after you. The sense of perfectionism comes from him.\n\nGrowing the brand is difficult, especially in a market where there's a dominant player and so that keeps me awake at night, thinking about what we can do to create impact and make a difference. I\u2019ve been in the role for two years and every day I wake up to ask if I have made a difference. We have grown our customer base six times since I joined. It's been blood, sweat, and tears with the team.\n\nWhat have you done lately that you were very proud of?\n\nProfessionally? The interoperability made possible with the help of the regulator, after five years, has enabled our customers to pay their bills online through the competitor\u2019s paybill number.\n\nOn a more personal front, just the impact on my younger children\u2019s lives - they are 10 and 12. Last year we had a bet with my two girls and I told them if they win academic awards, I would buy them a dog. And I don\u2019t like dogs at all. I think they are good to look at from afar. Anyway, they both got academic awards. So we had to get a dog and it's growing on me. It's a golden retriever - very playful, very friendly. It\u2019s destroying my flowers and I love gardening. It\u2019s taught my girls more responsibility even though they cook for themselves and stuff. This morning the dog messed up my flowers again and one of them she said,\"Maybe we can train the dog that it's not supposed to eat flowers\". I told her, \"You figure it out, it\u2019s your dog\".\n\nAre you living your life the way you want to?\n\nI pray so, yeah, because you don't have two chances. And losing both my parents taught me that - even though they lived to their 70s - life is short. The key is to create an impact on my family and my job. My dad was very disciplined; everday, five in the morning, he was in the office. He had such a high level of integrity. He used to tell us, \"You should be like Caesar's wife; above reproach\". He was very passionate and I think I take after him.\n\nI tend to be like a dog with a bone. I just go and refuse to give up. My boss says I'm like a woodpecker [Chuckles]. My mom was a teacher and after she retired, she started her school. She was hardworking and very friendly and extroverted. I got my father\u2019s genes. I look like him as well. He died of cancer after fighting it for seven years. He used to tell us, \"If you choose any cancer, have leukaemia. He had MCL (mantle cell lymphoma). Mom's symptoms started showing three months before she died. They died three years apart.\n\nAre you scared of cancer seeing as they both died of it?\n\nYeah, I mean, we all are, but you can't live life being scared. We all have to exit. The key thing is, what are you doing with the time that you have? What impact are you creating? Because at the end of the day, I believe God is just going to ask you, \"What have you done with the life that I've given you?\" My mom knew she had six months to live but she lived her life fully until the last day. So one has to live their life.\n\nDo you see yourself in your 60s, which is traditionally when people slow down and retire?\n\nI don\u2019t think I will retire. I plan to keep my mind engaged. I worked in the banking sector for two decades and looked at corporate deals across Africa because I worked in South Africa for two years and then came back and looked after SMEs and then moved to retail. That\u2019s a lot of learning and experience which I intend to use in consulting in my 60s. Maybe also sit on boards. I also love making social impact. God has given me so much and I shouldn't wait to be 60 to give back. It\u2019s something I\u2019m continually doing now outside work.\n\nWhat do you do outside work, outside family?\n\nChurch. I\u2019m passionate about making a difference. I got to the International Christian Centre. I was a deacon there at some point. Now my husband is a deacon. I also sit on a board at Pangani Girls. I head the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nWhen did you start serving the Lord?\n\nWhen I was in Form two. I used to have these recurring dreams where the world was ending and I'd be rushing to church, only to be told it's too late. One evening, I felt a very strong sense of presence, and I knew it couldn't be ordinary. Nobody talked to me. Nobody. You know, the way people now say they were led to Christ and stuff like that. No. For me, it was just at that moment\u2019s decision. I interpreted my dreams as a bigger calling that I heeded. Since then God has been a central part of my life. My leadership journey has been shaped by bibilical teachings. I constantly go back and read the Bible for encouragement in every sphere of my life.\n\nWhich is harder, leading people in church or at the workplace?\n\n[Chuckles] Being a deacon is like being a board member. It\u2019s an oversight role. People come to church to receive encouragement while in the office people\u2019s job is to create returns for the shareholder. People in church are more forgiving and they will take you in stride. The corporate world is more challenging, and that's why you go to church, right? To get more encouragement. [Chuckles]\n\nAnn Kinuthia-Otieno, Airtel Money CEO at a past company event. Photo credit: Francis Nderitu | Nation Media Group\n\nDid you meet Mr Otieno in church?\n\nNo, I met him when I was a corporate manager at Barclays, now Absa. So he's a financial consultant and there was a deal that he was doing and I was a corporate credit analyst. He's the deacon in the church, responsible for the finance docket.\n\nWhat did you learn about his people that surprised someone like you who comes from a different tribe?\n\n[Laughs] The unity of their family. Us Kikuyus can be individualistic sometimes. I think capitalism is very strong in Kikuyuland. I was surprised at the sense of unity in their village in Rongo, Migori. People just come to your home and are welcomed, people stay with each other\u2026I found that very refreshing.\n\nWhat's your extravagance?",

        "title": "Trific CEO Brenda Mbathi unveils investment plan after Two Rivers SEZ licence",
        "body": "In June 2023, listed investment firm Centum received a special economic zone (SEZ) licence covering 64 of the 106 acres of its Two Rivers development in Nairobi.\n\nA year down the road, the firm has announced a Sh6.1 billion funding package for the SEZ, which is known as the Two Rivers International Finance and Innovation Centre (Trific), from Africa-focused fund manager Vantage Capital.\n\nTrific chief executive Brenda Mbathi spoke to the Business Daily on the company\u2019s investment plan for the centre with the new capital injection, and the uptake of space at the facility over the past year.\n\nHow do you intend to deploy the new investment?\n\nOut of the investment from Vantage Capital, Sh2 billion will be allocated for acquiring and fitting out the Trific North Tower. This 14,975 square metre property will serve as a cornerstone of our SEZ.\n\nThe remaining Sh4 billion will be used to develop an additional office tower offering 76,800 square metres of leasable space. This development will provide the necessary infrastructure to support the influx of SEZ enterprises and ensure we meet the demand for high-quality office space.\n\nThe design and functionality of the new tower will reflect our commitment to creating a world-class business environment, setting a new benchmark for commercial properties in the region.\n\nWhat are the terms of the funding? Is it debt or equity investment?\n\nThe funding from Vantage Capital is structured as a mezzanine finance investment. This type of funding combines elements of both debt and equity, providing us with the capital required while being less dilutive to our shareholders than pure equity. It allows us to maintain a balanced financial structure, ensuring both stability and growth potential for Trific SEZ.\n\nMezzanine financing is particularly advantageous as it offers flexible terms and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the project. This flexibility is crucial for large-scale developments like Trific SEZ, where capital requirements vary significantly.\n\nBy utilising this kind of finance, we can optimise our capital structure, manage risks more effectively, and ensure the sustainability of our growth plans.\n\nHow many enterprises or organisations have signed up to the EPZ and what are their business focus area?\n\nTo date, 14 SEZ enterprises have signed up and secured space in the Trific North Tower. These enterprises operate across various sectors, including business processing outsourcing (BPO), shared services centres, regional headquarters, and investment holding corporations. Collectively, these enterprises are expected to create approximately 10,000 jobs and attract foreign direct investment amounting to about $65 million. The space is currently 70 percent committed by these enterprises in the Trific North Tower.\n\nWhat is your strategy for the SEZ now that you have the new funding?\n\nThe strategy is to leverage the new funding to enhance and expand our infrastructure, creating a more attractive and efficient environment for businesses.\n\nOur strategic location within Nairobi\u2019s prestigious diplomatic blue zone provides access to key markets and international business hubs. The SEZ framework in Kenya also offers various strategic incentives, including fiscal tax incentives, which are critical in reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability for businesses operating within Trific SEZ.\n\nTrific SEZ, therefore, offers an ecosystem designed to provide businesses with a competitive edge. This includes world-class infrastructure, advanced technology, and a regulatory framework conducive to business growth.\n\nBy fostering an integrated live-work-play ecosystem, we aim to attract a diverse range of businesses and talent, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to thrive.\n\nThe Kenya Finance Bill 2024 has proposed to exempt property transfers within an SEZ from capital gains tax. What would be the impact of such an exemption on the competitiveness of Kenyan SEZs?\n\nThe exemption from capital gains tax on property transfers within an SEZ that was proposed in the Finance Act was essentially a clarification, as capital gains tax exemption is already allowed within the SEZ Act and it is a significant financial benefit for special economic zones.\n\nThis exemption creates a more attractive investment environment for current and potential SEZ enterprises. By reducing the financial barriers associated with property transfers, we can facilitate smoother and more efficient transactions, encouraging more businesses to establish and expand their operations within the SEZ space.\n\nThis financial flexibility is crucial in maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring the long-term success of SEZs in Kenya.",

        "title": "Huge debts choking efforts to revive distressed companies",
        "body": "Kenya\u2019s financially distressed companies are grappling to secure a lifeline through \u2018administration\u2019 owing to their debts and late implementation of recovery measures, which pushed them into liquidation.\n\nAn administration process involves appointing an administrator to run a distressed company for one year with a possibility of extension by the court or selling it as a going concern to enhance its value for the benefit of its creditors.\n\nPlacing a firm under administration helps to regain control when it has serious cash flow problems, is insolvent, and faces threats from creditors. This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.\n\nData by the Office of the Official Receiver shows petitions for company liquidations are on the rise and have hit 30 since July 2023, highlighting the extent of financial distress facing businesses due to economic downturn and governance-related issues.\n\nAdministrators say keeping distressed companies as a going concern is becoming difficult because of debts that cannot be repaid within the \u2018administration period\u2019 of up to 18 months, citing the collapsed retail chain Nakumatt that went under with an estimated Sh38 billion worth of claims.\n\nLiquidation (or winding up) is the process by which a company\u2019s existence is terminated by selling its assets to pay off its debts. Any money remaining after all debts, expenses, and costs have been paid off is distributed among the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nSince the introduction of the administration process in 2015, Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, ARM Cement Plc. and Deacons Plc were the first to go through the process, with hopes that their recovery would set a positive trend for other companies likely to undergo the same process.\n\nHowever, these companies failed to survive the administration process, paving the way for their liquidation.\n\n\u201cThese companies are heavily indebted. They can\u2019t come out of that big hole. So, what we have been doing is trying to sell those assets to somebody who can buy them and put them to use because you find that by the time the company has gone that route, it can take them long to recover. I give an example of Nakumatt with Sh38 billion debt, which you can\u2019t expect to recover. No bank will give you more money to pay that,\u201d says Peter Kahi, a partner at PKF Consulting (K) Ltd.\n\n\u201cSo we look at options. The first option is to see whether we can rescue that company, the second option is to try and maximise the returns for all creditors so that at least they get something, and if you can\u2019t achieve the third option is to sell the assets to pay for preferential creditors and other claims. Most administrators have been going for option two or option three.\u201d\n\nThe number of petitions for liquidation of companies presented to court has more than doubled in the last nine years. Even after the new Insolvency Act (2015) introduced a provision for an \u2018administration process\u2019 to give a chance to financially troubled firms to put their houses in order and revert to the recovery path.\n\nPetitions for liquidations by the court rose to 30 in the 2023-24 fiscal year (July-June) from 13 petitions in the 2015-16 fiscal year (July-June), while the number of companies pushed into voluntary liquidation increased to nine from five in the same period.\n\nAbout 22 companies were put under liquidation through direct appointment in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Office of the Official Receiver.\n\n\u201cI can say these companies don\u2019t go into liquidation but somebody else comes to make better use of their assets because if you continue running that company how many years will it take you to pay off Sh38 billion debt because the administrators\u2019 period is 12 months with the first extension of maybe six months and that is what the law says,\u201d says Mr Kahi.\n\nKen Gichinga, a Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says recovery of companies under administration requires a combination of administration and managerial expertise to be able tackle deal with problems related to the weak macroeconomic environment and the \u2018trust deficit\u2019 reputation crisis occasioned by the \u2018receivership\u2019 tag.\n\n\u201cCompanies in receivership have to fight two battles which are a weak economic environment and the trust deficit battle associated with the high risk profile of companies in receivership. So you will find that the appointed administrators of these companies (in administration) end up fighting two battles instead of one battle and that is the reason it has been that hard to revive these companies,\u201d says Mr Gichinga.\n\n\u201c From the word \u2018administrator, the administrators\u2019 main concern is to keep the companies in administration as a \u2018going concern\u2019 but what these companies really need is almost a double level of management trend to be able to navigate this weak macroeconomic environment and to win the confidence of the customers. What we need is administrators working together with management gurus to revive these companies.\u201d\n\nAdministrators say that normally they are called upon when companies are in the \u2018intensive Care Unit (ICU)\u2019 with nothing to salvage as most assets have been stripped by the directors. These companies are going through a crisis in which they cannot meet their debt obligations, salaries are in arrears, auctioneers are calling at the doors of the company, the tax man is calling and critical supplies such as electricity have been disconnected.\n\n\u201cThere are three objectives of any administration. Reviving a company is the first and depends to a large extent on the state of the company at the point of the intervention,\u201d George Weru, a Business Recovery Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said in an earlier interview.\n\n\u201cIf the intervention is too late when the distress is very significant this is not practical. The administrator proceeds to the next objective which is to sell the business as a going concern. This ensures continuity of the business and saves jobs which to me is still a success.\u201d\n\nUnder the Insolvency law, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it fails to pay a debt of Sh100, 000 or more after 21 days of a written demand being served upon it.\n\nAccording to a law firm Maina & Onsare Partners Advocates LLP the process of administration is intended to offer breathing space for insolvent companies while availing better returns and packages for creditors which are not ordinarily available in liquidation.\n\n\u201cIt also gives Companies going through financial turmoil an opportunity to put their acts together. This allows them to continue operating instead of the earlier practice of abruptly killing them as was the case in the previous statutes (now repealed),\u201d the law firm says on its website.\n\n\u201cIt is an alternative rescue process which leads to a stay of past and future legal proceedings as envisaged by Section 560 & 561 of the Insolvency Act hence making it cheaper for the company.\u201d\n\nUp until 2015, a company in financial distress was met often with the liquidation culture triggered by voluntarily or by a creditor or subject to the court's supervision.",
        "summary": "This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.\nSince the introduction of the administration process in 2015, Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, ARM Cement Plc.\nHowever, these companies failed to survive the administration process, paving the way for their liquidation.\nThe administrator proceeds to the next objective which is to sell the business as a going concern.\n\u201cIt also gives Companies going through financial turmoil an opportunity to put their acts together.",

It also shows that they have lower ticket prices per deal compared to DFI and merger/acquisition transactions.\n\nRegarding geographical distribution of deals, Kenya accounted for 40 out of the region\u2019s total of 59 deals, followed by Uganda at seven deals, Rwanda and Tanzania at five deals each, and Ethiopia at two transactions.",

That spurred the government, in the 2024/25 Budget, to outline a raft of tax increases in a bid to get its fiscal consolidation plans back on track.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury data shows taxes grew at a slower rate of 10.83 percent year-on-year to Sh1.93 trillion than that in non-debt recurrent expenditure in the 11 months ended May.\n\nThe Ruto administration\u2019s plan to make up for slower growth in taxes than expenditure through Finance Bill 2024 was this week thwarted by youth-led demonstrators who poured onto the streets of cities and major towns countrywide saying additional taxes will exacerbate an already unbearable cost of living.\n\nDr Ruto was banking on the new taxes which targeted Sh346 billion in new revenue and expenditure cuts largely targeting non-essential expenditures such as hospitality and renovation of offices as well as slashing allocations for Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies to place the country on the path to a balanced budget by year 2027.\n\nAnalysts have, however, insisted that Kenya has an \u201cexpenditure problem and not a tax problem\u201d, indicating that the government needs to tame its spend further to achieve a balanced budget where borrowing is kept at minimal levels.\n\nInternational Budget Partnership's Country Manager for Kenya Abraham Rugo has cited supplementary budgets to cater for expenses that were not initially budgeted as the main driver of non-debt expenditures.\n\n\u201cGovernments are meant to exist and deliver services perpetuity which means that as the size of government grows, recurrent expenditures are likely to increase indefinitely,\u201d Dr Rugo said.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not mean that there are no wastages or inefficiencies in the public sector that drive a wedge between productivity and compensation (wages).\u201d\n\nState House, which has been undergoing a major renovation this financial year, has been the largest beneficiary of mini-budgets. Treasury data shows expenditure at the State House had exceeded the original full-year budget by about half (49.20 percent) in the 11-month through May to Sh9.5 billion.",

The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.\n\nDales adds:\n\nIt now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too.

        "body": "In February 2020, with the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader heating up, Keir Starmer\u2019s office received a helping hand.\n\nPeter Coates, the head of the dynasty behind Stoke-based online gambling company Bet365, donated \u00a325,000 to Starmer\u2019s office.\n\nCoates and the Bet365 group had been regular donors to Labour until 2015, to the tune of \u00a3490,000, but the money dried up in the Corbyn years, when Bet365 turned its attention to stopping Brexit, handing \u00a3512,500 to the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU.\n\nThe donation was a clear sign that the gambling industry spigot could easily be turned on again.\n\nNow, of the 12 most recent political donations by the industry and its executives, all have gone to Labour \u2013 a total of just under \u00a3400,000 stretching back to March 2020 \u2013 according to Electoral Commission records.\n\nBut that river of cash does not just indicate Labour\u2019s position as the likely winner of the 4 July general election. It also illustrates the deep-rooted ties between the Labour party and the \u00a311bn-a-year gambling sector.\n\nIn the past few weeks, revelations about bets apparently placed on the date of the election by Conservative politicians have prompted anger about an apparent problem with gambling infecting politics.\n\nThe furore has overshadowed the fact that, at the time the election was called, the Tory government was proceeding with its long-awaited white paper on gambling regulation.\n\nWith the future of those plans likely to be left in the hands of a Labour government, there are question marks over whether it is Labour, rather than the Conservatives, that has a gambling problem.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carolyn Harris has been one of few within the Labour party to have pushed for tougher regulation. Photograph: UK parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA\n\n\u201cThe stage is set for a proper public health approach to gambling policy,\u201d said Matt Zarb-Cousin, a gambling reform activist and former spokesperson for Corbyn. \u201cThe only thing stopping Labour going much further than the Tories on this issue will be the influence of the gambling lobby.\u201d\n\nIn its manifesto, published in early June, Labour talked tough, declaring itself \u201ccommitted to reducing gambling-related harm\u201d.\n\nThat task, in extreme cases the difference between life and death, will most likely fall to Stephanie Peacock, the shadow gambling minister.\n\nHer predecessor as Labour\u2019s MP for Barnsley East, Michael Dugher, is now the chair of the industry lobby group, the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC).\n\nHe and Peacock appear to be close, regularly congratulating one another on each other\u2019s political and personal achievements via social media.\n\nThe revolving door between Labour and the BGC does not stop at Dugher.\n\nThe lobby group has also employed the former Labour MP Anna Turley as a sports consultant, while its director of corporate affairs, Gary Follis, was an adviser to the erstwhile Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Turley, who lost her Redcar seat in 2019, is campaigning to be re-elected in the north-east constituency.\n\nDugher remains close to his friend and former colleague Tom Watson.\n\nAs the Labour deputy leader, Watson regularly denounced the worst excesses of the gambling industry, calling for more stringent regulation.\n\nUpon leaving politics, he took a job as an adviser to Paddy Power, a company he had previously denounced as both \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cmoney-grabbing\u201d after it offered odds on the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp.\n\nThen there are those donations. Labour is not alone in taking money from gambling companies \u2013 the Done brothers behind Betfred gave \u00a3375,000 to the Tories in 2016 and 2017.\n\nBut most of the industry\u2019s generosity has been bestowed on the party of opposition.\n\nSince 2015, prominent Labour MPs have received nearly \u00a330,000 from Red Capital Ltd, an investment vehicle owned by Jonathan Mendelsohn, the Labour peer.\n\nView image in fullscreen Michael Dugher, a former MP for Barnsley East, is now the chair of the Betting & Gaming Council lobby group. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nHe is also the chair of Evoke Holdings, which owns the William Hill, Mr Green and 888 gambling brands.\n\nRecipients of Red Capital\u2019s largesse include the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (\u00a35,000) and the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting (\u00a35,000). The party itself pocketed \u00a314,500.\n\nRichard Flint, a former chief executive of Leeds-based Sky Betting & Gaming, gave Labour \u00a325,000 in 2021, as well as \u00a310,000 to Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor and candidate for Leeds West who has held the seat since 2010.\n\nReeves also received \u00a310,000 that year from Neil Goulden, then a director of Gamesys, the owner of Virgin Games and Rainbow Riches Casino.\n\nBetween them, gambling companies who have donated to Labour, or whose senior staff have done so, have paid out almost \u00a340m to the Gambling Commission in the past three years for licence breaches including failure to protect problem gamblers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Others, however, require secondary legislation and must now be left up to Labour.\n\nThese include a statutory levy to fund addiction research, education and treatment, as well as the introduction of a new ombudsman.\n\nThe volume of gambling advertising in British society also remains an open question, one that campaigners said was wrongly omitted from the white paper.\n\nSome observers have said they are wary of the tone of Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge and what it means for unresolved regulatory questions.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the industry on how to ensure responsible gambling,\u201d the party said, prompting a letter to the Guardian from academics concerned about industry influence.\n\nLiz Ritchie, of the charity Gambling With Lives, hopes reformists will also get their foot in the door at Westminster.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are very hopeful that a Labour government would listen to families bereaved by gambling suicide and learn from the catastrophic failures of regulation, public information and treatment that has characterised the industry-controlled system to date.\u201d\n\nLabour declined to comment further about its gambling policy plans or relationship with the industry.\n\nBut for those who believe that money buys influence, reformists appear to be on manoeuvres too.\n\nFew people gave more to Labour last year than the little-known former casino entrepreneur Derek Webb. He has previously thrown his weight behind reform, including legal support for Gambling With Lives and the successful campaign to curb fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).\n\nWebb gave \u00a3300,000 to Labour in 2023, nearly as much as anything the party has had from gambling tycoons.\n\nPeacock declined to comment.",

Last year the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, referenced that campaign when trailing the prospect of a NatWest share offer, declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s time to get Sid investing again.\u201d\n\nOne industry source said the nationwide push had been originally intended as a \u201cpre-election sweetener\u201d, as the Conservatives now face the prospect of their worst ever election defeat.\n\nA second source said McDonald was chosen because of how highly he is still rated by the public on trust, despite having retired from news broadcasting almost 16 years ago.\n\nIt is understood that the 84-year old agreed to front the campaign on the condition that he did not directly call on the public to buy shares but instead could suggest that they might consider the opportunity \u2013 hence the strapline \u201cAre you in?\u201d being developed.\n\nHowever, the now postponed campaign has also been viewed as controversial given its scale and timing ahead what had been expected to be an autumn general election.\n\nThere were already questions about whether the government should be selling down its stake at a discount to the public when it has proven it can gain better returns at market rates, given that NatWest was bailed out by taxpayers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "The North Sea\u2019s biggest oil and gas infrastructure company is risking fires and environmental disasters, experts have warned, as documents reveal it is failing to plug its ageing oil wells in time and is missing decommissioning deadlines by up to a decade.\n\nLast year, the fossil fuel firm Perenco faced controversy after an oil spill from its Poole Harbour operations polluted the Dorset site, which is internationally recognised for its ecological importance. The RSPB reported oiled birds in the water at the largest natural harbour in Europe, which is one of the most heavily protected areas in the UK. Perenco promised it would never happen again and committed to pay for the damage caused.\n\nDocuments released to the climate website Source Material after a freedom of information request reveal the Anglo-French oil group repeatedly missed government deadlines to decommission its oil wells for up to a decade.\n\nThe company owns 363 offshore wells in the North Sea, and plugging the ageing infrastructure will cost up to \u00a38m for each.\n\nCritics have raised concerns that the company has a financial incentive to delay cleaning up the assets that are at the end of their lives. Unplugged wells can leak dangerous chemicals into the water and atmosphere, risking pollution and fires.\n\nThe documents show 17 wells where Perenco has either requested a late extension to a decommissioning deadline or missed it. In two of these cases, the deadline was missed by more than a decade. One Perenco well, north of the Anglia field, was set for shutdown in 2011 but had still not been fully decommissioned by July 2022.\n\nAnother, near the Indefatigable field, was due to be abandoned by 2009 but was still not fully sealed and dismantled when the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), the government body that regulates decommissioning of wells, set a new deadline 11 years later. As of now, it remains unfinished.\n\nIn a statement, Perenco said it had reached a new agreement with the NSTA to abandon them by 2025.\n\nRegulators at the NSTA called Perenco bosses into a meeting in Aberdeen in 2022 to ask why they had not been plugging the old oil wells. An official wrote: \u201cYou agreed to come back to me with the steps Perenco has taken to prevent recurrence,\u201d asking why the company had not closed a well as promised.\n\nThe Perenco oil company is owned by the billionaire Perrodo family, who are ranked at No 17 on the Sunday Times rich list. They get hundreds of millions of pounds a year in dividends from their UK oilfields. Perenco UK Ltd paid them a total of \u00a3734m in dividends between the beginning of 2022 and June 2023.\n\nThe failures of Perenco to clean up ageing oilfields risk environmental disasters such as the one at Poole Harbour, experts have said.\n\nDavid Santillo, a marine scientist at the University of Exeter, told Source Material: \u201cDamage to the integrity of structures could range from a slow but persistent spread of oil residues or other toxic chemicals to surrounding waters and sediments up to a more catastrophic blowout. Containment and cleanup would be practically impossible.\u201d\n\nPerenco is the UK\u2019s largest North Sea infrastructure owner, with 45 offshore platforms and nearly 1,500 miles of pipelines.\n\nHowever, the company has been plagued with controversy over the decommissioning of its ageing oilfields. In April this year, regulators fined it a record \u00a3225,000 for discharging 59 tonnes of gas into the atmosphere at a plant on the North Sea coast. The Health and Safety Executive\u2019s database of penalties and enforcement notices shows Perenco is responsible for 15% of North Sea breaches in the past five years, despite accounting for about 2% of production.\n\nIn 2022, there was a fire at one of Perenco\u2019s oil rigs and the NSTA served it with an enforcement notice as it failed to ensure the undergoing decommissioning activities were free of hydrocarbon. Officials said: \u201cThis indicates that your procedures and arrangements were not suitable and sufficient to ensure hydrocarbon-free status and prevention of risks to persons on the installation.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

In 2022 a decommissioning deadline was postponed from July to September. But in August, Perenco said that it needed to \u201cmaximise production right now to support the UK economy\u201d and did not have the available rigs to start decommissioning until \u201clate 2024\u201d.\n\nSantillo said: \u201cIt is part of the covenant that government and civil society has with the oil and gas industry that they will clean up and remove their materials when they finish making their profits. In the end, it\u2019s about the industry doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nA Perenco spokesperson said the company had spent more than \u00a3500m on decommissioning since 2009 and its \u201csafety record in the North Sea has shown continuous and steady improvement.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence, safety-related key performance indicators are all trending in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the company\u2019s requests for delays, he said Perenco had a \u201cgood, open dialogue\u201d with the regulator, and that decommissioning was sometimes rescheduled to promote efficiency.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn occasions, Perenco has disagreed with the regulator regarding the optimal scope and phasing of operations, and the regulator has exercised its right to enforce action.\u201d\n\nHe denied Perenco was failing to decommission rigs on time to save money, adding: \u201cEach year we spend hundreds of millions of pounds diligently stewarding the assets under our care. Our Perenco workforce work tirelessly, 365 days per year, 24/7, to maintain safe operations and manage responsibly the vital national resource, providing clean, reliable energy from natural gas for the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.\n\nA number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.\n\nHowever, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.\n\nMark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThis is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.\u201d\n\nLucinda O\u2019Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: \u201cNow is the time to act, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs.\n\nMany of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.\n\nAt the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.\n\nThese require a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires \u00a310,000 to open an account.\n\nHowever, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d.\n\nThis is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively.\n\nOther providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d\n\nIt is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.\n\nLoyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.",

Currently, one in 10 children are affected by it and it is considered a key driver of poverty in the UK. We spent six months with families across the country to build a picture of the impact of this rule on day-to-day family life.

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.\n\nI hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",
        "summary": "Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\nBritain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error.\nAnd suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\nBut right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",

        "title": "BEP: This 5.5% Yielding New Energy Company Has An AI-Catalyst (NYSE:BEP)",
        "body": "artJazz\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is a renewable energy company that owns a large amount of wind, solar and hydro assets and invests aggressively into the growth of its portfolio.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners offers passive income investors a globally-diversified investment portfolio of renewable energy assets that produces a growing amount of funds from operations.\n\nThe partnership has delivered double digit funds from operations growth since 2016 and is selling for a moderate FFO multiple, making a purchase particularly compelling for passive income investors that want to leverage the company\u2019s FFO strength.\n\nBrookfield profits from growing energy demand from AI-focused data centers.\n\nPortfolio Footprint, International Diversification, Contracted Cash Flows,\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners invests in renewable energy assets, primarily in the U.S., but also abroad which gives the company improved diversification.\n\nAt its core, Brookfield Renewable Partners develops and operates new energy assets in the hydro, wind and solar markets, but also invests in energy storage and biofuel production.\n\nIn total the company had energy assets representing 32,500 megawatts in its portfolio and Brookfield Renewable Partners is ramping its exposure particularly in the solar field.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Brookfield Renewable Partners had more than $100 billion invested across the world, of which 62% fell to North America. Another $18 billion of investments are located in South America, Europe is responsible for $16 billion of new energy investments with the remainder of $6 billion falling into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nPortfolio Footprint (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nHydroelectric was responsible for the majority of BEP\u2019s funds from operations in 2023. Hydro earned BEP $624 million in funds from operations which was by far the single, most important FFO source.\n\nThe last year was also a record year for Brookfield Renewable Partners in terms of FFO per unit. BEP earned $1.67 per unit in funds from operations, reflecting 7% YoY growth.\n\nFunds From Operations (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners is compelling as an investment for passive income investors because BEP contracts 90% of its energy production in advance, meaning the BEP is locking in prices early and has therefore a lot of earnings and cash flow predictability.\n\nThe average length of its underlying energy contracts is 13 years which creates long-term earnings security for Brookfield Renewable Partners and, for the customer, long-term energy supply security.\n\nAI Is Driving Data Center Energy Needs, Is A Long-Term Growth Catalyst\n\nThe world is becoming greener and governments around the globe are creating incentives for companies to invest in new energy sources and crowd out fossil fuels.\n\nWith that said, the present rate of new energy investments is not sufficient to meet long-term energy needs. For instance, to speed up new energy development, create energy certainty for its customers and initiate durable FFO streams, Brookfield Renewable Partners struck a agreement with Microsoft in May 2024 to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity.\n\nI anticipate Brookfield Renewable Partners to strike similar deals with other large U.S. companies such as Google, Meta Platforms or Amazon which are also focused on pursuing net-zero climate goals.\n\nData Center Energy Needs (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nA catalyst for accelerating renewable energy investments could come from growing demand from data centers which have escalating energy needs due to the use of AI.\n\nAccording to Brookfield Renewable Partners, data centers are going to grow from 2% global energy consumption to 10% by the end of the decade as companies invest in AI capabilities.\n\nOwners of renewable energy assets are therefore confronting with escalating energy demand, particularly if other companies follow into the footsteps of Microsoft which has set a zero-carbon footprint by 2030.\n\nGlobal Data Center Power Demand (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nBrookfield identified generative AI adoption, specifically coming from data centers, as a catalyst for growing power demand in the future.\n\nAs new developments in AI drive demand for electricity, Brookfield Energy Partners is well-positioned, as a leading, globally-operating renewable energy company, to meet the energy requirements of the data center sector.\n\nBEP\u2019s CEO also indicated as much when he explained the rationale behind the deal with Microsoft to power the software company\u2019s data centers.\n\nPower Consumption Growth (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nGoldman Sachs corroborated those views by projecting a sharp rise in data center power demand until the end of the decade. In a research piece from May 2024, Goldman Sachs Research indicated a 5x increase in the global data center power consumption between 2016 until 2030.\n\nData Center Power Demand (Goldman Sachs Research)\n\nGrowing FFO And Distribution\n\nPassive income investors would want to own a piece of Brookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 business primarily because the partnership is growing its distribution consistently and has done so over a very long time.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 renewable energy assets are producing durable funds from operations growth and the partnership has the numbers to back this up: Between 2016 and 2023, Brookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 funds from operations increased each year, on average, by 12%. Brookfield Renewable Partners has a long-term FFO per unit growth target of 10% annually which the partnership obviously exceeded rather comfortably in the last seven years.\n\nFunds From Operations Growth (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)\n\nIn terms of distribution, Brookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 growth rate was 6%, about half of its FFO growth rate, which leaves room for investment in new energy assets in order to set the partnership up for long-term, durable income growth.\n\nBEP Is Trading At A Moderate FFO Multiple\n\nIn 2023, Brookfield Renewable Partners grew its funds from operations 7% YoY to $1.67 per unit. If Brookfield Renewable Partners grows its FFO by a similar growth rate in 2024, then investors could see $1.79 per unit as FFO showing up on the partnership\u2019s books at the end of the year.\n\nWith a unit price of $25.62, Brookfield Renewable Partners is presently selling for 14.3x estimated 2024 FFO. Brookfield Renewable Partners was selling at $29 just a month ago, implying FFO multiple of 16.2x.\n\nIn the last year, Brookfield Renewable Partners sold between 11.2x and 16.9x FFO so the present multiple of 14.3x is moderate, in my opinion.\n\nWhy The Investment Thesis Might Be More Risky Than It Seems\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future performance so just because Brookfield Renewable Partners achieved double digit FFO growth in the past doesn\u2019t imply that passive income investors will see a similar rate in the future.\n\nThere are also legitimate concerns as to how quickly the renewable energy sector can grow, as the electric-vehicle industry, to name just one example, presently deals with a serious slowdown in demand.\n\nFossil fuels will probably remain a key energy source in the future and not be completely phased out.\n\nSlowing FFO growth is probably the most severe headwind for Brookfield Renewable Partners moving forward.\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners is a compelling investment for long-term passive income investors as the market for renewable energy solutions is growing.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners has the track record to make a compelling case for itself predominantly because the partnership has grown its funds from operations at 12% per annum since 2016.\n\nThe distribution has increased at half the rate, 6% per annum. A tailwind for the new energy sector in general could be the growth of the data center industry which itself is fueled by accelerating adoption of AI which requires a lot of computing power, and thus energy.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners is poised to leverage these trends to its advantage and with a growth-oriented distribution strategy, I think BEP should be included in a passive income investors\u2019 portfolio.",
        "summary": "Portfolio Footprint, International Diversification, Contracted Cash Flows,Brookfield Renewable Partners invests in renewable energy assets, primarily in the U.S., but also abroad which gives the company improved diversification.\nIn total the company had energy assets representing 32,500 megawatts in its portfolio and Brookfield Renewable Partners is ramping its exposure particularly in the solar field.\nAs of March 31, 2024, Brookfield Renewable Partners had more than $100 billion invested across the world, of which 62% fell to North America.\nData Center Energy Needs (Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.)A catalyst for accelerating renewable energy investments could come from growing demand from data centers which have escalating energy needs due to the use of AI.\nAs new developments in AI drive demand for electricity, Brookfield Energy Partners is well-positioned, as a leading, globally-operating renewable energy company, to meet the energy requirements of the data center sector.",

        "title": "SPY: Expect A Volatility Spike (SP500)",
        "body": "Rabbitti\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you've been reading my articles for a while, I think you know that I've been advocating looking at the S&P 500 Index (SP500, NYSEARCA:SPY) constructively and not buying the index itself in ETF format, but instead focusing on individual names (with a clearer bias towards value). Contrary to my expectations and the expectations of other skeptics regarding the high probability of an imminent SPY correction, the index has continued to update its ATHs as expectations have risen regarding the growth of artificial intelligence and its role in the future of operational efficiency and thus higher margins and corporate profits.\n\nSeeking Alpha, my coverage of SPY\n\nDespite its exceptional strength of late, I think the S&P 500 index is likely to feel a spike in volatility shortly - on the eve of the US election this is the norm, plus the seasonal factor suggests a high probability of this event. My basic recommendation for today is to be prepared for increased volatility soon, and not to be fooled by excessive growth optimism.\n\nWhy Do I Think So?\n\nJust yesterday, June 27, the presidential election debate cycle began. I don't want to draw any political conclusions here, but rather take a look at the history of how debates influence the behavior of stock market indices.\n\nTME newsletter, Barclays [proprietary source]\n\nAccording to analysts at Barclays (proprietary source), the S&P 500 index is at least in a slight correction 10\u201315 weeks before the actual election day, although it usually rises rapidly after the election day, based on the last 4 cases. Currently, we see the SPY breaking out to the upside, but if the experience of the last 2 decades is anything to go by, we are already approaching a short-term turning point.\n\nA look at the S&P VIX Index (VIX) confirms the thesis that the S&P 500 Index is likely set to surprise investors negatively due to 2 main factors. Firstly, the VIX is currently at its locally very low levels - the probability of an upward movement is rising sharply.\n\nSeeking Alpha, VIX\n\nSecond, going back to the election as the main catalyst for the VIX rise, history helps us to better recognize the probability that exists. According to Nomura (proprietary source), options markets tend to price in the presidential election ~3 months before the event, and that hasn't happened yet, but we're rapidly approaching that upcycle:\n\nNomura [June 24, 2024], proprietary source\n\nThe probability calculated considering the fact of the election year is also confirmed in the sample without this criterion: If we look at the June 1990 data, we see that the VIX has the highest seasonal odds of a rapid expansion in the next 8 weeks, with median expansions of 4.27% in August and 8.9% in September.\n\nTrendSpiders Software, the author's notes\n\nEvery statistical pattern must have a logical basis. I attribute the rise in volatility in presidential years to the increasing uncertainty that always spooks markets. The principle at work here is similar to uncertainty in corporate earnings: If investors can't properly calculate what the chances are that the profits from their investment will continue to grow in the future, they prefer to trim, which leads to increased volatility. The same thing usually happens with broad-based ETFs. However, this is not yet the case if you look at this Goldman Sachs data (proprietary source) showing the further expansion of market participants' cumulative equity positions ahead of the elections.\n\nTME newsletter, Goldman Sachs data [proprietary source]\n\nThe discrepancy that exists today between the historical and current behavior of the index provides an excellent opportunity to hedge against the highly likely increase in volatility in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nFrom what I see today, the market seems completely unconcerned and unprepared for the uncertainty that the pre-election period usually brings: Neither the price action nor the cumulative flow to US equities suggests that anything ominous could be waiting on the horizon for investors. However, a statistical pattern is crying out for it, both in terms of the historical momentum of the S&P 500 Index and the setup that has formed in the VIX.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that while optimism still prevails, it is unlikely to last too long - the logic that explains past patterns is still valid, and therefore US equities should dive into a correction or consolidation (at least in the short term). Therefore, I urge investors to be vigilant and not increase their equity exposure even if this asset class looks strong today.\n\nThank you for reading!",

        "title": "Nike Q4 Results: Selloff Presents Opportunity For Equity Bargain Hunters (NYSE:NKE)",
        "body": "Robert Way\n\nShares in sneaker giant, Nike (NYSE:NKE), were pummeled in the aftermarket hours on Thursday following the release of its fiscal Q4 earnings results. The stock dropped about 12% after pairing a forward guidance cut with an underwhelming sales report.\n\nHeading into the release, shares were already down 17% over the past year, including a 13% loss YTD. The added selling pressure in the after-hours session pulled shares down to a pricing level last seen four years ago during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSeeking Alpha - 1-YR Share Price Performance Of NKE\n\nI had previously expressed bullishness in NKE following a previous bout of market pessimism surrounding inventory levels. That update didn\u2019t age well, given the over 10% decline in the stock since the update.\n\nNonetheless, I remain bullish on Nike. In fact, I believe the stock is ripe for new or further initiation at current pricing levels, which in my view may be near a bottom for the stock.\n\nWhat Went Well In Nike\u2019s Earnings Release\n\nNike\u2019s performance products were a standout during the quarter. If these were the only products on tap at the company, sentiment would have likely been very different following the earnings release. In this category line, Nike reported double-digit growth. Contributing to the growth were Nike\u2019s offerings of basketball apparel and footwear. The partnership with Caitlin Clark could have been a factor here. It could also be beneficial in the periods ahead.\n\nNike also reported strength in their fitness business, particularly in the women\u2019s category. Statement leggings were up high double digits, according to CEO John Donahoe\u2019s earnings commentary. Women\u2019s fitness footwear also benefitted from strong demand for the Motiva brand. This contributed to market share gains in the category. Looking ahead, commentary was positive surrounding the fall order book. I would, therefore, expect continuing strength in both the performance and fitness product categories in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn the earnings front, Nike also reported a 110 basis point (\u201cbps\u201d) improvement in gross margins. This combined with improved SG&A leverage contributed to overall diluted EPS of $0.99/share during the quarter, up 50% YOY, and a consensus topping non-GAAP EPS of $1.01/share.\n\nNKE Q4 Earnings Release - Snapshot Of Comparative Revenue And Gross Profit\n\nWhat Went Wrong In Nike\u2019s Earnings Release\n\nThe strength in Nike\u2019s performance and fitness categories were overwhelmingly offset by weakness in their lifestyle categories. Donahoe attempted to inspire confidence in the category by elaborating on upcoming product initiatives, but this didn\u2019t appear to land as intended with investors.\n\nNike also reported essentially flat full-year revenue growth, including a 2% decline in Q4, which was fueled by weakness in their digital channels. The company also reported soft traffic trends in their factory stores. This is indicative of the broader macro challenges faced by their value consumers.\n\nGeographically, topline sales were held back by softer sales trends in China. While the region reported revenue growth of 7% during the quarter, much of this was due to an earlier start to the holiday shopping season.\n\nContributing most to investor disappointment was a dramatic cut to the forward outlook. In providing guidance, CFO Matthew Friend noted that total revenues would be down mid-single digits in fiscal 2025. This represents a significant pivot from previous estimates of sales growth. In addition, he guided for a double-digit revenue drop in Q1 and a high-single digit decline for the first half of the fiscal year. This compares to previous estimates of a more modest decline.\n\nIs Nike Stock A Buy Following Earnings?\n\nNike is deep in the figurative woods. The company has warned of macro-related challenges and has lowered their full-year outlook accordingly. The lowered outlook is perhaps unsurprising, given that the company\u2019s sales are growing at its most meager rate in decades at just 1% on a full year basis.\n\nStrategic mishaps through the neglect of the running market has also contributed to the rise of Hoka-owner, Deckers Outdoor, a company that has fully capitalized on the market opportunity and is up nearly 100% over the last year. This compares to NKE\u2019s 18% decline over the same period.\n\nIn my view, the challenges and the resulting share price weakness present an attractive opportunity for bargain hunters seeking basement bin pricing. Shares dropped to levels last seen four years ago following the after-hours release of its full year results. At current pricing, the stock is trading at about a 21x forward multiple. This is a steep comedown in valuation for a stock that has commanded 30x over the last five years.\n\nCompetitive pressures and strategic lapses perhaps justify the lower multiple at this moment in time. But despite its tribulations, Nike is still the top dog in the industry, generating annual sales that are more than double its nearest competitor, Adidas.\n\nStrategic missteps and ongoing share price weakness create ripe conditions for the possibility of activist interest and/or leadership change. Dour forward guidance also sets a low bar for a surprise to the upside. Both possibilities could serve as a catalyst for forward momentum in a stock that appears overdue for a win.\n\nInvestors in NKE may presently find themselves deep in the equity woods. Greener pastures, however, may await those willing to see the forest through the trees.",

        "title": "SkyWest: Why This Airline Stock Could Continue Flying (NASDAQ:SKYW)",
        "body": "murat4art\n\nIntroduction\n\nSkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ:SKYW) is the holding company that owns SkyWest Airlines and SkyWest Leasing. At SkyWest Airlines, the company owns nearly 500 aircraft that connect millions of travelers each month (over 38 million annually) to over 250 destinations across North America. The company has about 1800 daily flights. Its fleet of aircraft includes 89 CRJ200 aircraft, 105 CRJ700 aircraft, 41 CRJ900 aircraft, and 240 E175 aircraft.\n\nOver the years, SkyWest has emerged from the pandemic as the strongest American regional airline. That's a big claim, but one backed up by its results. Coming out of a nightmare situation during the pandemic, the company has unlocked significantly better asset utilization, which has translated to revenue growth and margin expansion. The company has significant operating leverage to continue expanding margins, and the Embraer aircraft in its fleet will be fully paid for starting in 2026. In my view, as pilot staffing continues to improve, lighter capex needs should boost the company's free cash flow profile and translate to strong shareholder returns. In this article, I'll discuss my outlook for the company, my thoughts on valuation, and why I believe the SkyWest story is underappreciated by the market.\n\nCompany Website\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nOver the last few years, U.S. regional airlines faced significant crises which put their businesses at risk. The first was a global pandemic where fears with respect to COVID-19 put a damper on travel as travelers were forced to stay home due to lockdowns and most were afraid to travel even after that. The second was a pilot shortage, where the pandemic accelerated the retirements of pilots, many of whom were already near retirement. These issues, among many others, meant that many of the regional operators faced significantly worse balance sheets. The burden of long-term debt and dilution to equity holders put off most investors as the outlook looked very weak.\n\nToday, some of that is now behind us, but these challenges have shown who will be and who won't be the long-term winners. With respect to SkyWest, the company is now seeing higher demand, as demand for regional capacity is consolidating around SkyWest, Republic, and the wholly owned regional airlines (Endeavor, Envoy, PSA, Piedmont, and Horizon) with the smaller third-party carriers losing significant share. In my view, this should allow SkyWest to continue taking share from competitors. As I'll discuss later, SkyWest has a decent balance sheet that's well-positioned relative to struggling smaller carriers.\n\nAnother key point to my investment thesis is that SkyWest has managed the pilot situation much better than peers. To fill their own gaps when post-pandemic demand for flights skyrocketed, the U.S. major airlines, to have recruited heavily from the regionals, effectively stealing their pilots from underneath them. At many of the larger careers, the minimum requirements have changed to be more relaxed. Whereas it used to be a minimum of a bachelor's degree and a minimum of 2,000 hr. of command experience before they would be considered by a major, many of those qualifications are now removed.\n\nWhile SkyWest is still doing much better than other regionals, it is still short by 2000 pilots relative to demand. Compared to pre-pandemic, when they had about 5400 pilots, today, they are now short by 1000 and could still use another 1000, given demand. While it will take several years for demand and supply to reach equilibrium, I believe SkyWest is well positioned to continue taking share from competitors, particularly from regionals.\n\nIn my view, SkyWest could see a multi-year improvement in both margins and free cash flow as better pilot staffing drives higher revenue production and more and more of the debt associated with the E175 fleet begins to be fully paid off. By year-end 2024, optimization of the Embraer should be close to full utilization. On the latest earnings call management expects that they should be able to increase CRJ flying by 30% as captain staffing is solved.\n\nRecent Results\n\nWhen looking at the recent results for SkyWest, the company reported revenue of $804mm, which was up 16.2% year over year, primarily as a result of flying contract rate increases along with higher production for the quarter. On margins, operating margins clocked in at 12.4%, about 3.4 percentage points better than analyst estimates of 9.0% (source: Bloomberg). Block hours for the quarter were 4.9% higher year over year but were essentially flat compared to Q4'23.\n\nCompany Filings\n\nOverall, I think the outlook looks pretty strong for SkyWest. Block hours are projected to be up 6% sequentially next year, driven by a meaningful improvement in captain attrition (adding net new captains each month during the quarter) along with strong demand from flying partners. With modest capex needs, I expect that this incremental demand will boost margins and trickle down to FCF growth.\n\nWith the free cash flow, I expect that management will be active in buying back stock. Back in May 2023, the company authorized a share repurchase plan to buy up to $250 million of company shares. As at the end of the quarter, there was $82.2 million available under the May authorization. I wouldn't be surprised to see the buyback limit renewed and upped next quarter.\n\nWith respect to the balance sheet, SkyWest is in a strong position. As per the company's filings, it has 202 debt-financed E175s and took delivery of over half of these between 2014 and 2017. The debt used to acquire these aircraft is 12-year fully amortizing, so they will begin to be fully paid off in 2026. Per management, they are expected to have over 13 years of remaining life after the debt is paid. At the end of the quarter, the company had a net leverage of 3.6x compared to 4.9x just six months ago. About 41% of the 475 aircraft that are in scheduled service are owned outright.\n\nCompany Filings\n\nNet debt is now lower than pre-pandemic levels. Following the planned repayment of $400mm in debt by the end of the year, the company's debt could be at the lowest point it's ever been in over a decade (source: S&P Capital IQ).\n\nThe airline industry is a slow-growing, mature industry. Despite this, I still think SkyWest has opportunities for growth. Management expects 100 65-76 seat aircraft to be made available by its mainline partners, and it should be in a strong position to win a lot of this business. During the last few years, I'm of the news that management has shown forward-thinking during the last few years, especially in extracting value from its CRJ-200 fleet. These assets are fully depreciated and unencumbered. From an accounting perspective, that's great because that expense has already been recorded. At the same time, in practice, management is monetizing them through multiple initiatives, including SkyWest Charter and its investment and arrangement with Contour.\n\nValuation and Wrap Up\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, consensus EPS estimates for SkyWest are at $6.56 in 2024 and $7.56 in 2025. This implies that the company is trading for 12.2x earnings or 10.6x on a forward basis. Overall, I find the valuation to be quite reasonable, despite the share price run-up. For one thing, I don't think we are at peak earnings yet; historically, SKYW has traded in the low double-digit P/E multiples in prior growth cycles. As a cyclical stock, I wouldn't be inclined to hold the company long-term, but letting the stock run its course makes a lot of sense, in my view. With a positive outlook and a track record of navigating recent difficult periods well, SkyWest deserves its premium valuation. While there are risks to any investment (continued industry uncertainty around the lack of qualified pilots, economic weakness, and the threat of pandemics, terrorism, and war), I SkyWest offers compelling value at the current price and is a best-in-class operator. As such, I rate shares a 'buy' and would consider adding on any short-term dips.",

        "title": "Newmont Stock: Healthy Pullbacks Are A Good Thing (NYSE:NEM)",
        "body": "chameleonseye\n\nContributed by Mark Malinowski, produced with Avi Gilburt.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSome might say quoting yourself is a bit of an early victory lap, but back in March, we said, \u201cPrecious metals and precious metals miners are on the cusp of a run.\u201d\n\nScreen grab from March SA article. (SA)\n\nBack in our March article on Newmont (NYSE:NEM)(TSX:NGT:CA), we had a strong start off a high probability bottom. Since the little jog back to 33s for a higher low, it climbed another +34% to $44s, giving us a solid five waves up off February. It has since been consolidating. Why? Did the fundamentals that supported our bullish thesis back in March change?\n\nThe production earnings reports from Q1 reflected a couple of notable things that were anticipated in our last update, but several that were not.\n\nFirst, the industry standard measure of All in Sustaining Costs per ounce (AISC) was expected to rise slightly. The reported numbers moved from 1376 USD/oz in Q1 2023 to 1439 USD per oz for Q1 2024. I expect this metric to improve as redundancies from the Newcrest Acquisition are removed. Second, Newmont\u2019s net income, while vastly improved from Q4, was still well below that of Q1 2023, despite higher gold equivalent ounces sold. This continues to reflect their higher borrowing costs in the current elevated interest rate environment. I expect this to continue to improve in Q2 with higher output, further reduction of debt, and Fed rates being reduced.\n\nThe first unexpected element of the report was a return of capital through board authorization of a 1.0 billion share-repurchase program. I view these actions as a reflection of internal calculations showing the rate of return for buying back shares at the current price is a better investment than more debt reduction. The ultra-conservative view on commodity prices assumptions was the second thing I noted in their report. Using gold prices of 1900 USD/oz and silver prices at 23 USD/oz most likely reflects some of their contracts and hedging, but I still view this as very conservative. Third, the Brucejack facility only produced 37 k oz in Q1 2024. The annual production rate for 2023 was 286 k oz (71.5 k oz/ quarter). While in the bigger picture, production continued to ramp up, there are no press releases about Brucejack restarting since it was shut down after a tragic fatality in December 2023.\n\nBrucejack\u2019s shutdown is likely the most significant negative impact on results. The unanticipated things outside of Brucejack\u2019s shutdown that I have identified from combing through their reports are not significant needle-moving things for Newmont\u2019s share price.\n\nIn other words, we need a catalyst for the share price to make a large change. That also means there has been very little in the way of fundamentals that have changed for Newmont, so why has the share price pulled back so much?\n\nPullbacks\n\nFrom an Elliott Wave perspective, when a stock retreats 50% or slightly more of its move off a low, it is one of the healthiest things for long-term price follow-through. From a Fibonacci Pinball perspective, the ideal retrace zone is a bit more broad, starting at a 38.2% retrace all the way back to 61.8% retrace.\n\nEveryone loves an investment that immediately takes off to the upside as soon as they buy it. Many individual investors who bought that opportunity try to just keep riding that stock higher. Sometimes that works, sometimes it does not. The immediate boom and grind higher pattern can be very difficult to choose good opportunities to add and maximize your investment return. Equally challenging can be identifying technical levels of support in order to place stops. The comment I often overhear about stocks like this is, \u201cI only wish I had gotten more.\u201d However, the reality is that a chart with a clear price structure and \u201cpredictable\u201d pullbacks is far superior. You might ask, how can that be?\n\nPullbacks are healthy\n\nFrom an Elliott Wave perspective, a clear price structure with the right proportions is the ideal. By clear price structure, I mean waves up and down that are proportional with an ideal mathematical model. These waves provide clarity about key targets and supports. They also let you know when you are wrong, so exits can be made gracefully, rather than being all or nothing trades. If we do not get pullbacks, it is extremely difficult to provide shorter term targets and support levels or to know when you are wrong.\n\nI am sure many of you have seen this before, but it is the illustration of why pullbacks are so important. The simple answer is all the math is based on the move up off the low and the place where it pulled back to. Simply put, we call this a i-ii or 5 up and 3 down setup. To people experienced with this description of a chart, this is similar to ringing the dinner bell.\n\nBasic Fibonacci PinBall Structure (EWT)\n\nUpdating the Keys to Success\n\nLast time I talked about all the reasons I was bullish on metals and miners from the stretched prices, ratios and the fundamentals of Newmont. We talked about 3 key things changing for Newmont.\n\nFirst, the Pe\u00f1asquito mine has been up and running since October (it was shut down last year for 5 months due to a labor dispute). For context, this is the fifth-largest silver mine in the world, the second largest in Mexico and wholly owned by Newmont. Second, the income is starting to roll in from the purchase of Newcrest Mining in November 2023 with the second full quarter of revenue coming to a close at the end of June. The cost savings from removing redundancies is still coming (this takes about 9 to 12 months for 75% of the savings to be realized in my experience). Thirdly, the expected increases in the price of gold, silver and copper continue to play out. Newmont produced almost 400 thousand more gold equivalent ounces in Q1 2024 than they did in Q1 2023.\n\nTable of NEM Operating Stats (Nemont)\n\nThe delta will be even larger in Q2 and Q3 when Pe\u00f1asquito was open for 2 months of Q2 and closed for all of Q3. Investors are starting to catch on. The bottom line is, Newmont production has and will year-over-year show significant increases.\n\nIf you want to review or reread that discussion in more depth, check it out here: Looking for a Spark.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at some of the charts.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the GDX to Gold Futures Ratio. This says to me that we have started, but miners are still lagging the move that gold has made over the last 8 months. In other words, I am looking for miners to continue to outperform gold. I also feel like the ratio is showing us that there is a long way to go yet in the bull run for miners relative to 2016 and 2020.\n\nGC to GDX Ratio (Trading View (Mark))\n\nComparing Newmont with the price of gold, silver and copper, we can see the outperformance continues to be significant, but only when measured relative to the April 2022 Newmont high.\n\nNEM vs Precious Metals 1Day (TradingView (Mark))\n\nIf we compare them to the low in Newmont in February, we start to see a very different picture unfold.\n\nNEM vs Precious Metals 144min (Trading View (Mark))\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n\nNEM June 25 Daily chart (MMA (Zac))\n\nZac posted the following in the MMA room on June 25 along with the chart above:\n\n\u201cNEM has given us a solid potential 5up off the Primary degree high probability low for a B wave we were looking for back in February. It has not yet given us a clear reliable retrace into the \u2018ideal\u2019 Fib support region but is behaving well as a corrective retrace digesting the +50% move off the lows. The most reliable Fibonacci retrace zone starts at the 38.2% and extends down to the 50% and then 61.8% Fibs. Since a more shallow retrace is certainly valid, but not initially reliable we are leaving the door open to the yellow path shown for a wider and deeper wave 2. This 1-2 structure fits as the first pieces of 5up for a larger Intermediate degree (1) of our Primary C starting. Moving over the recent high would make the yellow path less of a threat, however it would still not be wholly reliable as a start to 3, rather we would then be considering the possible purple alt shown where a move over 44s could be the alt v of a larger 5up. This might be too big to be just the wave 1 of (1) but not large enough for (1)... since a C-wave up could be an Ending Diagonal pattern I have labeled that purple alt as an A-B of (1).\u201d\n\nIn the simplest of terms, pullbacks are the cooling of sentiment associated with any chart. Charts cannot continue on a hot streak without melting down eventually. It is much better for metals to be heated and cooled in successive cycles to increase their strength.\n\nWhile we place a certain importance on the largest component of the GDX having a bullish set-up, we do see many names that have consolidated quite nicely over the last month. Every chart is treated individually, even when the overall sector has a bullish pattern.\n\nStock Waves continues to identify high probability targets at the intersection of fundamentals and technicals. We continue to see a very bullish 2020s decade for commodities, but not all charts are the same. We relish the diverse patterns we see even among the precious metals mining stocks, as they present more opportunities for rotation than in an \u201call-the-same\u201d market.",

        "body": "ssuaphoto\n\nForeword\n\nThis article is based on Fortune magazine's 2024 survey of 500 Largest U.S. Corporations (F500-IL).\n\nThe Fortune 500, in its 70th year, ranks the biggest U.S. companies by revenue. In total, Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the U.S. GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ 31 million people worldwide.\n\nThis article covers the top profit generating companies in 66 industries.\n\nAny collection of stocks is more clearly understood when subjected to yield-based (dogcatcher) analysis, this collection of F500-IL for 2024 is perfect for the dogcatcher process. Below are the June 26 data for the 57 dividend stocks populating those F500IL as parsed by YCharts.\n\nThe prices of 3 of the 57 dividend selections made the possibility of owning productive dividend shares from this collection a reality for first-time investors.\n\nThe 3 Dogcatcher ideal best to buy June 2024 stocks were: Altria Group (MO); Energy Transfer (ET); AT&T (T).\n\nThose three all live up to the ideal of having their annual dividends from a $1K investment exceed their single share prices. Many investors see this condition as \"look closer to maybe buy\" opportunity.\n\nActionable Conclusions (1-10): Analysts Estimated 19.3% To 41.46% Net Gains From Ten F500-IL Dividend Stocks Into June 2025\n\nFour of ten top F500-IL dividend stocks by yield were also among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (They are tinted gray in the chart below.) Thus, the yield-based forecast for these May favorites was graded by Wall St. Wizards as 40% accurate.\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\nEstimated dividends from $1000 invested in each of the highest yielding F500-IL stocks, added to the median of aggregate one-year target prices from analysts (as reported by YCharts), generated the following list. (Note: one-year target-prices by lone-analysts were not included.) Thus, ten probable profit-generating trades, projected to June 2025 were:\n\nHaliburton (HAL) was projected to net $414.64 based on the median of target estimates from 28 analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 93% greater than the market as a whole.\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) was projected to net $271.13 based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 25 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 23% greater than the market as a whole.\n\nEnergy Transfer LP was projected to net $263.27, based on the median of target price estimates from 17 analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees.

The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 1% greater than the market as a whole.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) was projected to net $204.75, based on dividends, plus the median of target price estimates from 21 analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to risk/volatility 26% less than the market as a whole.\n\nMcDonald's Corp. (MCD) was projected to net $198.78, based on the median of estimates from 31 analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees.

These gain estimates were subject to average risk/volatility 9% greater than the market as a whole.\n\nSource: Open source dog art from dividenddogcatcher.com\n\nThe Dividend Dogs Rule\n\nStocks earned the \"dog\" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as \"dogs.\" More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, \"underdogs\".\n\n63 F500-IL In June Per Analyst Target Data\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\n63 F500-IL June Yields\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\nActionable Conclusions (11-20): Ten Top F500-IL By Yield\n\nTop ten F500-IL by yield in June represented seven of eleven Morningstar sectors. First place was held by the lone consumer staples representative, Altria Group [1].\n\nThe energy member placed second, Energy Transfer LP [2]. Then, third place went to communication services, namely, AT&T [3]. A lone industrials member placed fourth, United Parcel Service [4].\n\nThe first of two healthcare representatives placed fifth, CVS Health (CVS) [5], the other placed tenth, Johnson & Johnson [10].\n\nSixth place was claimed by the first of two technology representatives, International Business Machines (IBM) [6]. The other techie took ninth, Cisco Systems (CSCO) [9]. A utilities member took the seventh position, Southern (SO) [7].\n\nFinally, eighth place was claimed by the lone real estate representative, Prologis [8], to complete the 2024 top ten F500-IL dividend pack in June.\n\nActionable Conclusions: (21-30) Ten Top F500-IL In June Showed 17.12% to 40.46% Upsides, and (31) Three -1.04% & -3.83% Down-siders\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\nTo quantify top dog rankings, analyst median price target estimates provided a \"market sentiment\" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield metrics, median analyst target price estimates became another tool to dig out bargains.\n\nAnalysts Forecast A 19.52% Advantage For 5 Highest Yield, Lowest Priced, of 10 F500-IL Dividend Stocks From June\n\nTen top Fortune F500-IL yield (dividend / price) results, provided by YCharts, produced the following ranking.\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\nAs noted above, the top ten F500-IL stocks screened 5/30/24, showing the highest dividend yields, represented seven of eleven in the Morningstar sector scheme.\n\nActionable Conclusions: Analysts Predicted 5 Lowest-Priced Of The Top Ten Highest-Yield F500-IL (32) Delivering 17.01% Vs. (33) 15.653% Net Gains by All Ten Come June 2025\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\n$5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten F500-IL by yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 27.11% more gain than $5,000 invested as $0.5k in all ten. The fifth lowest-priced selection, CVS Health Corp, was projected to deliver the best net gain of 29.02%.\n\nSource: YCharts.com\n\nThe five lowest-priced top-yield F500-IL for 2023 Dividend Dogs as of June 26 were: Energy Transfer LP; AT&T; Altria Group; Cisco Systems; CVS Health, with prices ranging from $15.92 to $60.63.\n\nFive higher-priced F500-IL Dividend Dogs as of June 26 were: Southern Co; Prologis; United Parcel Service; Johnson & Johnson; International Business Machines, whose prices ranged from $78.21 to $171.87.\n\nThe distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' \"basic method\" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of \"market sentiment\" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 15% to 85% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 15% accurate on the degree of change.\n\nThe net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions. Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of \"dividends\" from any investment.\n\nAfterword\n\nThis article features Fortune 500 Industry Leaders and focuses on the top 30 for March.

        "title": "AvalonBay: No Margin Of Safety At The Current Price (NYSE:AVB)",
        "body": "Alex Potemkin/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nAvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) is currently trading at about 18.6x 2024 FFO and slightly above their four-year average dividend yield. They are also trading at a premium to the sector as measured by the P/AFFO. In this article, we estimate AvalonBay\u2019s value using the net asset value per share (NAVPS). The NAVPS of a REIT is not as readily available as the other valuation statistics. One reason for this is because there is a fair amount of subjectivity that is required to estimate the NAVPS. Notwithstanding this limitation, there are well reasoned studies that support the view that purchasing REITs at a discount to NAVPS leads to outperformance and, conversely, purchasing REITs at a premium to NAVPS leads to underperformance. At a minimum, investors can use the NAVPS in conjunction to the other valuation statistics to support an investment action.\n\nThere are several variables in estimating the NAVPS, but the three main items are the net operating income (NOI), the capitalization rate (cap rate) and the long-term debt. Since these are the three main items and the estimate of NAVPS is subjective, we offer the reader color in how we use these inputs and their relation to the overall performance and strategy of AvalonBay.\n\nUsing the framework described, we find that AvalonBay has a net asset value per share of $178.29 which indicates that shares are overvalued and that a hold recommendation is warranted.\n\nOverview and Strategy\n\nThere are cycles that buoy AvalonBay\u2019s business model. An important one is the high cost of homeownership. 92% of AvalonBay\u2019s NOI come from apartments that are in the established coastal markets of New England, the Metro New York/New Jersey region, the Mid-Atlantic region, California and the Pacific Northwest. While these areas tend to have a higher median income than the rest of the country, they also have an even higher cost of homeownership which more than offsets the benefits from the higher median income. Please see Exhibit 1.\n\nExhibit 1. AvalonBay Investor Day Presentation November 2023 (AvalonBay Presentations)\n\nIn addition, the established regions tend to have high regulatory barriers that limit new housing supply entering the market, another tailwind for AvalonBay.\n\nWith respect to housing demand, AvalonBay is not resting on their laurels. They are expanding to Sunbelt regions which have growing employment in high wage industries that also exhibit elevated home prices. The expansion areas are Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte in North Carolina, Dallas and Austin in Texas, Southeast Florida and Denver, Colorado. The expansion regions have less barriers to entry for new housing supply, but as the CIO suggested in the recent earnings call, there is more than enough demand to offset the new supply entering the market. For the expansion markets, AvalonBay\u2019s competitive advantage is going to come from its scale, expertise and their access to lower cost of debt. AvalonBay has a A3 rating from Moody\u2019s and a A- credit rating with S&P. Both have stable outlooks. Assuming developers in expansion markets have roughly the same access to labor, and raw materials, they will likely not have access to lower cost of debt than AvalonBay.\n\nNet Operating Income\n\nNOI for 2023 was $1.887 billion which was a growth of 8.32% versus 2022 NOI and a compound growth of 13.8% from 2021 NOI. For 2024, management has guided a 2.1% growth in NOI. The growth is decelerating which would support the strategy to rebalance the portfolio towards the expansion markets. Currently, the expansion markets make up 8% of the portfolio and AvalonBay has signaled a target of 25% of the portfolio for the expansion markets. The NOI figure mentioned includes same store NOI as well as communities categorized as stabilized and under redevelopment. Stabilized communities were those acquired during the year and redevelopment communities are those that have or are in some form of redevelopment. AvalonBay also purchases vacant land or land with improvements and then razes it to build their apartment communities. Vacant land, land held for sale and assets under development do not contribute to NOI.\n\nAn increase in NOI is going to be tied to leases and leases are a function of occupancy. For leases, AvalonBay expects lease renewal rates to come in slightly above 4% from 2023 numbers. For Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023, average monthly revenue per occupied home was $2,967 versus $2,842, which is in line with what we can expect moving forward. Physical occupancy was 95.6% in Q1 and 95.5% in April and May. These are in line with historical averages for the sector.\n\nSource: AvalonBay 10-K for 2023 and 10-Q for Q1 2024, AvalonBay May 2024 Investor Presentation\n\nCap Rates\n\nFor Q1 2024, the implied cap rate for apartment REITs was 6.15% which matches the average cap rate for the Apartment sector from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2024. While this might suggest a reversion to the mean dynamic, the spread between the implied cap rates and the US 10-year Treasury is only 199 basis points and well below the 295 basis point average for the period. Please see Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Implied Cap Rate and Spread to the US-10 Year Implied cap rate 6.15% Long-term average 6.15% Current implied cap rate spread to the US 10-year 1.99% Long-term average 2.95% Click to enlarge\n\nSource: Nareit T-Tracker, St. Louis Federal Reserve and author's calculations. The spread was estimated using a two-quarter lag for the US 10-year Treasury. We found a higher R-squared with the lag.\n\nPeeling behind the numbers, there is industry-wide dynamic that is playing out. Sellers of real estate assets are waiting for a lower interest rate environment in which asset values will be repriced higher and buyers are pointing to the current interest rate environment which justifies a lower price point for the assets. The net effect is that transaction volume is muted and is about where it was in the 2017-2019 time period.\n\nIn terms of our analysis, we shall use the 6.15% figure as a cap rate, but as a caveat, if the cap rate spread to the US 10-year reverts to historic norms then that would mean a higher cap rate and a lower net asset value.\n\nDebt\n\nAvalonBay has $8.043 billion in debt, which is about 23.3% of their capital structure and has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.06. Both metrics are well below the sector averages and consistent with similar credit-rated apartment REITs. AvalonBay does have three notes maturing in the relatively near term. There is a 3.66% note for $300 million which will mature in November this year. They also have a 3.55% $525 million note that matures in June 2025 and a $300 million 3.62% note maturing in November 2025. Taken together, this represents about 14% of their total indebtedness.\n\nSource: REITWatch April, 2024\n\nThey have a 5.35% note that matures on June 1st, 2034 that exchanged hands at a 5.21% yield. Should AvalonBay replace the maturing notes with notes of a different tenor, they are likely to have a higher interest rate expense.\n\nOther Balance Sheet Items\n\nAs mentioned earlier, AvalonBay sometimes buys vacant or improved land and then develops it into an apartment community. Two items on the balance sheet that reflect this are \u201cconstruction in progress, including land\u201d and \u201cland held for development\u201d. They had one \"real estate asset held for sale\" as of Q1. In general, AvalonBay intends to reposition their portfolio by opportunistically disposing of assets in their current markets and then acquiring assets in expansion markets until they get to the 25% allocation.\n\nAvalonBay had investments in five unconsolidated entities with ownership interest ranging from 20.0% to 50.0%. These items are carried on their balance sheet at fair value.\n\nNet Asset Value Per Share\n\nPlease see the table below for our estimate of the net asset value per share.\n\nTo arrive at our estimate, we take the 2023 NOI and project at growth rate of 2.1% as guided. We take the 2024 NOI figure and discount it by the implied cap rate to arrive at the operating asset value. We subtract debt and then divide by the shares outstanding to arrive at net operating asset per share.\n\nWe then calculate the nonoperating asset per share and add this to the net operating asset per share to arrive at our net asset value per share estimate of $178.29.\n\nTable 2: Net Asset Value Per Share Estimate ($ in thousands except per share data) Projected NOI $ 1,926,370 divide by Implied Cap Rate 6.15% equals Operating Asset Value $ 31,323,085 minus Debt $ 8,043,242 equals Net Operating Assets $ 23,279,843 Shares Outstanding $ 142,223 Net Operating Asset per Share $ 163.69 Nonoperating Asset per Share Construction in progress, including land $ 1,210,773 Land held for development $ 211,546 Real estate assets held for sale, net $ 9,629 Cash and cash equivalents $ 287,892 Restricted cash $ 135,658 Unconsolidated investments $ 220,384 Shares Outstanding 142,223 Nonoperating Assets per Share $ 14.60 Net Asset Value per Share $ 178.29 Click to enlarge\n\nConsiderations\n\nAVB closed at $203.88* and there is a meaningful divergence between the current stock price and our estimate of the net asset value per share. There are two items to consider with respect to this. Firstly, REITs such as AvalonBay that have low debt levels and a good track record of capital allocation** tend to be given a premium in the marketplace. On the minus side, the NAVPS estimate did not contemplate \u201casset preservation capex\u201d which are capital expenditures that will not result in increased revenue or expense saving. These are capital expenditures that are required to maintain the current apartment units. As a rough estimate, asset preservation capex is about 6-7% of NOI for AvalonBay. In this particular case, our bias is towards ignoring both any premium for low debt and capital allocation track record and any discount for the asset preservation capex estimate. One washes the other.\n\n*Closing price on June 26, 2024. ** Morningstar assigns an \"exemplary\" capital allocation score to AvalonBay. In assigning the score, Morningstar looks at balance sheet items, company investments and shareholder distributions.\n\nThe last time the shares touched our estimate was in early March. The stock traded close to our estimate in the middle of April as well.\n\nSeeking Alpha and Trading View\n\nRisks\n\nThere are at least two risks worth keeping in mind. REIT performance is impacted by the level and expected direction of interest rates. A \u201chigher for longer\u201d scenario would mean that as debt comes due, they will have to be refinanced at a higher rate. While the NAVPS estimate incorporates debt, it does not incorporate interest expense. Secondly, the strategy of expanding to Sunbelt markets carries risk not directly mentioned. Elevated homeownership costs is one but not the only competition for AvalonBay. Investors of different sizes can and have purchased apartment units with the main purpose of earning rental income. There are other REITs that have access to relatively cheap debt that also want to reposition their portfolio towards the Sunbelt regions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn terms of the business, AvalonBay is proceeding with their blueprint and there is no obvious departure in their strategy.\n\nIn terms of an investment, while the P/FFO measure points to the shares being fairly valued it is helpful to corroborate this with a valuation measure that considers a different aspect of the business. Having both measures suggest there is no margin of safety at the current price increases confidence that a hold recommendation is warranted.\n\nStated differently, a purchase of the stock at the current price can be expected to market perform. A purchase price that is closer to the net asset value per share would position the investor to outperform the market.",

        "title": "Chr. Hansen: Outperformance After The Merger And New Novonesis (OTCMKTS:CHYHY)",
        "body": "javi02\n\nDear readers/followers,\n\nThis will be the last coverage of the Chr. Hansen Holding A/S (OTCPK:CRTSF) (OTCPK:CHYHY) ticker after the merger with Novozymes A/S (OTCPK:NVZMY). I have been invested in Christian Hansen for a number of years, and have been covering the company with a bullish rating here on SA for some time as well. My latest coverage can be found here in December of 2023. In that article I spoke a bit about the pending merger with Novozymes, and why I believed this to be a value-add for the company and for the shareholders in either.\n\nIn the last stand-alone coverage for Christian Hansen, the company recorded strong financial performance with 16% organic revenue growth and double-digit growth in core segments.\n\nChristian Hansen was a Danish company with premiumization and low yield but offered above-average growth potential on its own, and even more now. The company is, now together with Novozymes, in something as \"alchemical\" as an enzymes business, which is surprisingly more volatile than you'd expect, but is expected to generate good upside over the next few years.\n\nIn this article, we'll look at the merged businesses and what remains to invest in - also, establishing my first target for the merged businesses.\n\nNovozymes & Christian Hansen and the merger after the fact\n\nNeither Novozymes nor Christian Hansen still remain in the original form and it's not as though Novozymes somehow just \"absorbed\" Chr. Hansen. Instead it was a merger of equals where only the name remained somewhat similar - but Novozymes had a tradition going back to 1925 when two Danish brothers aimed to produce insulin in a laboratory that they founded. Novozymes in the shape that the company was prior to the merger was actually spun off from Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) back in 2000 and went on to inorganically grow quite extensively, with operations in nations like China, India, Brazil, Argentina, United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.\n\nThe name of the new company is Novonesis.\n\nThis new company is a leading bio-solutions partner, and the merger was officially finished back in late January of this year. There was never really a question for me of this not going through, but still good to see it executed.\n\nSo what is Novonesis, the result of Chr Hansen's merger? How will it deliver value to shareholders?\n\nNovonesis, as a play on bio solutions, is, in turn, a play on a number of megatrends, trends like the growing population worldwide with an evolving need for nutrition and health, and higher demand for clean eating, fuels, better nutrition, alternative protein sources, food waste trends, and the like. All of these trends are in favor of how Novonesis does business, and the company in fact claims that the market for biosolutions is still in the very early stages of development.\n\nNovonesis, as a business is segmented into two primary areas - Food & Health biosolutions, and Planetary Health Biosolutions (quite a name). These segments have a product split or segmentation that looks as follows.\n\nNovonesis IR (Novonesis IR)\n\nAt a surface level appeal, this is a very attractive investment based on this, not in the least because the company is already a significant market leader in many of these segments. Current company expectations range from a 6-8% organic CAGR, which will come as the company hopes 2-3% from upselling, and 3-4% from market growth and pricing (as well as a slight amount from increased penetration).\n\nThe company works with Bacteria, Yeast, Probiotics, Enzymes, and Proteins to create a better world. It improves the texture of food, the health benefits, the taste, the appearance, the simplification of labels, and the safety. It also allows for increased product yields and less waste and energy usage.\n\nNovonesis IR (Novonesis IR)\n\nThe company expects Biosolutions to outgrow overall other markets, with current significant growth on an annual basis, between 1-3%.\n\nMy one question with regard to former Chr. Hansen here is how Novonesis is going to deliver the spoken-about synergies between the two companies. And there are some answers to be had here. Novonesis will combine the two capabilities with cross-selling for products like Cheese flavor creation, yeast solutions for beer, and a new combination of enzymes and cultures with a stronger value proposition for new protein/plant-based solutions.\n\nThe company also works with a number of what-if scenarios, of what could happen to its sales if certain (somewhat possible) things were to happen.\n\nNovonesis IR (Novonesis IR)\n\nNovonesis started trading on the Copenhagen stock market with the ticker NSIS-B and currently trades at a price of 431 DKK/share. The company offers a yield of less than 1.5%, but has less than 21% long-term debt/capital and a market cap of over 200B DKK - so is solid here, and is currently estimated to generate annualized growth in the ranges of 12-16% per year, which would imply a favorable premiumization when it comes to valuation. This is entirely in line with how both Novozymes and Christian Hansen traded prior to the merger. The question of whether this company is an attractive one is, as I see it, answered clearly with a \"yes\".\n\nNovonesis IR (Novonesis IR)\n\nThese companies that we're talking about - Chr Hansen and Novozymes, have always commanded a very high premium. This, by the way, is also true for many other Danish companies - they are typically not cheap, and Danish companies also typically have a relatively low dividend yield. These are some of the reasons why Danish investments are relatively \"slim\" when it comes to my portfolio.\n\nNovonesis IR (Novonesis IR)\n\nHowever, let's look at some upsides and risks of Novonesis.\n\nRisks & Upside to Novonesis/Christian Hansen\n\nThe risks to this company exist, but they are far smaller now than they were before, when the two companies were still on their own. I would argue that the company's underlying growth quality is now far better due to a better sales mix and diversification potential. Inorganic growth initiatives and plans can be a net risk, and I spoke about this in conjunction with the merger, but I no longer believe this to be a negative \"game changer\" here. I still don't believe, also, that even with Novozymes, this company can manage a superb and above-average market or sales growth rate. I forecasted a lower dividend rate, and this has very much materialized. The market risk for the company's (Chr. Hansen's) legacy products also still needs to be pushed as well. While Chr. Hansen has comprehensive research proving the veracity of its probiotic strains, this still needs to be pushed to consumers, who need to be convinced.\n\nOn the other hand, the newly merged company is by far the dominant global player in enzymes and diary cultures. It's almost ridiculously dominating at this point.\n\nIt's possible to clarify this even further with numbers. The combined company now has over 50% of the global market. It has the largest commercially available strain library on earth, and the upside if the company's forecasts for the basic trends are accurate, is technically without many limits on the upside. At any time this company would become cheap and with the fundamentals the same, I would be investing here.\n\nIn the end, this remains a valuation-oriented play, more so even than before.\n\nAny risk to the company long-term is made up for by fundamentals and quality. The only question to my mind left is growth. And this takes us to the company valuation.\n\nValuation for Novonesis\n\nChristian Hansen's merger with Novozymes has created Novonesis, a 200B+ market cap Danish specialty chemicals/biotech business. It's one of the most attractive biotech and chemical businesses out there as I see it, due to a significant, attractive market share in very basic fields.\n\nBecause of a virtually unassailable market position, I give the company high marks for the moat and even consider it a premiumizing argument and factor. The company is currently estimated to slightly grow its earnings this year, up to around 11.41 DKK for the year (Paywalled FAST Graphs link), with 10-25% growth annualized for the coming few years in 2025-2026E. This comes to a combined annualized estimated growth rate of 15%. This is very good.\n\nThe yield unfortunately is far lower even than the risk-free rate. At less than 1.5% it's not an argument for investing, merely a small bonus to the capital appreciation offered by the company here - but both Novozymes and Chr Hansen, which is what Novonesis is, have high marks in forecast accuracy of over 90% accuracy on a 2-year basis.\n\nUnfortunately, as is the case with some mergers, many investors seem to have taken out the victory for this company in advance. Despite not actually materializing this earnings growth, Novonesis is now trading at almost 40x P/E. While I do accept a premium, I do not accept 40x P/E. The company is, to my mind, closer to the combined 5-10-year average for both Christian Hansen and Novozymes until it proves some of the synergies announced by the participating companies. This comes to a low of 29x and a high of 32x - a fairly narrow range, which I believe gives us good visibility for where we can make a profit here.\n\nAt current valuation levels, this is not something that is possible, in my mind.\n\nFAST Graphs Novonesis Upside (FAST Graphs Novonesis Upside)\n\nWhat you see there is an example of the upside the company could have, which is less than 8%, and that's to a premium of over 31x P/E. I am unwilling at this point in time to go far above this, and would therefore say that based on growth estimates - even good ones - the valuation dictates that this company now be a \"HOLD\".\n\nThe valuation targets for this company are mixed. We have 16 analysts following the business that consider Novonesis interesting at a low of 350 DKK and a high of 540 DKK. The average for these 16 analysts comes to 440 DKK, which gives us an upside of less than 2.5% here. Despite this, 7 analysts out of 16 are at \"BUY\", and only 5 are at \"HOLD\". So the overarching theme here from analysts is a positive one for the company - and one I currently do not agree with.\n\nI believe the likely scenario, if invested at this valuation and unless the company \"inflates\" (which I never count on), you're likely to get substandard returns below 10% per year, even including dividends. Because I am not interested in such meager returns, I am not investing here (yet), even though I consider the company to be very attractive.\n\nI consider the company attractive enough however, to hold my shares at this time, and would not rotate here unless we see price levels of over 500 DKK, at which point we'd be talking well over 40x P/E.\n\nMy introductory price target for Christian Hansen/Novozymes company Novonesis, is 400 DKK/share. This enables a double-digit upside and a more conservative outlook.\n\nThesis\n\nNovonesis is a leader in technologies relating to microbial and fermentation, specifically enzymes, Health/Nutrition, and similar fields. The company's components, specifically Chr Hansen and Novozymes, have averaged double-digit earnings growth for over 10 years and are usually traded at a high premium akin to some of the highest P/E companies out there. I would also say that the combination of these two companies also deserves, if the growth rate continues, a relatively high P/E.\n\nIn order to invest in the business, you need to accept that high premium and that potential high growth rate outlook, as well as the meager yield of below 1.5% after the merger of the two businesses, and currently at ~1.4%.\n\nBecause I accept the premium and forecast the company to around a 31x P/E, I cannot see an upside here if the company continues to manage double-digit growth and starts out Novonesis as an investment at a PT of around 400 DKK/share, which would be where we see double-digit annualized upside potential.\n\nThat makes this company a \"HOLD\" here, and one of the highest P/Es of any company that I accept, even if it drops. The company is less attractive now in June of 2024. I won't be selling my shares - at least not yet - but I would consider the company a rotation target if we, during this year, approach a 500 DKK share price.\n\nRemember, I'm all about:\n\n1. Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight, and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.\n\n2. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1.\n\n3. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation, but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows.\n\n4. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.\n\nHere are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).\n\nThis company is overall qualitative.\n\nThis company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.\n\nThis company pays a well-covered dividend.\n\nThis company is currently cheap.\n\nThis company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansions/reversion.\n\nI will not call Chr. Hansen Holding A/S successor stock Novonesis \"cheap\" here, and I would not consider it a \"BUY\", but a \"HOLD\".\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "body": "#Inflation\n\nWhen the U.S. Department of Commerce releases its personal income and outlays report for May, most eyes will be trained on the inflation data. Specifically, the core personal consumption expenditures index will provide further evidence on whether the lack of progress in lowering inflation earlier in the first quarter of the year was a bump in the road or a worrying trend. In April, disinflation appeared to resume, but one month does not make a trend.\n\n\n\nBy the numbers: Core PCE is expected to tick up 0.1% M/M in May, according to the consensus by economists, slowing from the 0.2% increase in April. On a year-over-year basis, that would come to a 2.6% rise compared with a 2.8% increase in the prior month. The Federal Reserve prefers to focus on core PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, because it better reflects underlying inflation trends, than the Consumer Price Index. CPI measures the price changes on a fixed basket of goods and services, while PCE measures what consumers are actually spending, reflecting changes in behavior like substituting cheaper products when inflation rises.\n\n\n\nIf the actual numbers bear out, that could give Fed policymakers increased confidence that inflation is heading \"sustainably\" toward the central bank's 2% goal. When they're confident in the path of inflation, then they'll consider making their first interest rate cut in the cycle, but they won't rush to judgment. While several Fed officials insist they'll need several more months of data to attain that confidence, see how WSB subscribers forecast rate cuts playing out this year.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of inflation: The topic was a big one at the presidential debate last night, serving as a central theme and barometer of the economy. Tariffs were also discussed, as well as the impacts that the national debt, immigration and tax legislation might have in relation to prices. In fact, that's how the showdown kicked off, with moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash flagging the economy as the \"issue that voters consistently say is their top concern.\" (8 comments)\n\nMore on the debate\n\nMany statements, numbers and claims were touted in last night's presidential debate, but many of the takeaways focused on the demeanor and coherence (or lack thereof) that both candidates displayed on stage. Decision-making at the ballot box can be dependent on temperament and abilities, but also check out what each of the candidates said about specific areas of the economy. For investors looking to play the elections through market instruments, there are some politically driven Republican and Democratic ETFs. Note that shares of Trump Media & Technology (DJT) are also up 7% premarket to nearly $40. (52 comments)\n\nThe other foot\n\nNike (NKE) shares tumbled 12.4% AH to $82.52/share on Thursday after the sportswear giant cut its guidance, citing increased macro uncertainty, worsening forex effects and softness in China. Nike's adjusted profit topped estimates, but revenue fell 2%, with Wall Street expecting a 1% gain. \"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" CFO Matthew Friend said during the earnings call. Executives also acknowledged the lack of innovation at Nike, especially in the most recent fiscal year as competitors gained traction in the fitness and running categories, but management aims to double the growth of the product pipeline by the end of 2025. (38 comments)\n\nDEI backlash\n\nAfter facing weeks of backlash on social media, Tractor Supply (TSCO) is pulling back policies that it said were unpopular with its customers. The farm supply retail chain will eliminate all DEI roles and targets, withdraw carbon emission goals and stop sponsoring non-business activities like pride festivals and voting campaigns. Instead, it will focus on ag education, animal welfare and veteran causes, as well as land and water conservation efforts. \"We heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\" Tractor Supply said in a statement. \"We've taken this feedback to heart.\" (11 comments)",

        "body": "An ATM dispenses $100 U.S. banknotes. selensergen\n\nI love owning businesses that prioritize their shareholders. This probably means slightly different things from one person to another.\n\nAs a dividend growth-oriented investor, here's what it means to me: A company that can balance investing for future growth with sending value back to its shareholders. This can be done via share repurchases and/or dividend payments.\n\nUntil recently, Alphabet (referred to as Google hereafter) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) leaned entirely on the former. However, a swelling cash balance and robust free cash flow led Google to initiate a $0.20 quarterly dividend per share on April 25.\n\nThis move alone was a nearly 0.4% bump in my portfolio's total net annual forward dividend income. That's because, aside from Broadcom's (AVGO) 5% weighting, Google's 2.8% weighting now makes it my second-highest weighted dividend payer. Overall, the tech giant is my third-biggest holding, behind Amazon's (AMZN) 2.9% weighting.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nSince I initiated coverage with a strong buy rating last November, Google has topped the 21% returns of the S&P 500 index (SP500) by nearly 14 points.\n\nThis short-term outperformance makes sense as the historical data from Hartford Funds (specifically Figure 7) backs up long-term outperformance as well: Dividend growers and initiators have beaten an equal-weighted S&P 500 index by almost 250 basis points annually from 1973 to 2023. For perspective, that's more than a 3X difference in ending investment amounts between dividend growers and initiators and an equal-weighted S&P 500 index.\n\nAt the time when I rated Google's shares a strong buy, I appreciated the company's dominant plurality share of the digital advertising market. It was more than the next 10 competitors combined. I was also impressed by the sizable net cash position. Relative to my fair value estimate, shares were also almost 20% undervalued at the time.\n\nNow, I think after the sharp rally in the last six months, shares fall short of a strong buy. However, first-quarter results are more than enough to update my coverage with a buy rating. For one, Google blessed shareholders with its 13th double-beat in the last 20 quarters. The momentum throughout its businesses should further allow vigorous future growth. Google's newly initiated dividend is handily covered by earnings and free cash flow. Lastly, my upward revision to fair value means shares are still discounted.\n\nA Robust First Quarter And More Growth Ahead\n\nGoogle Q1 2024 Earnings Press Release\n\nJust as high-quality businesses regularly do, Google delivered the first-quarter results that analysts and shareholders were expecting and then some. The company's total revenue surged 15.4% higher year-over-year to $80.5 billion during the quarter. For perspective, that was $1.8 billion ahead of Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus for the quarter.\n\nStrength throughout most of the business was what contributed to this vigorous topline growth.\n\nGoogle Search & other revenue climbed by 14.4% over the year-ago period to $46.2 billion in the first quarter. According to the company, this was a combination of paid clicks growth and cost-per-click growth. The former grew by 5% due to the secular trends of user adoption growth and rising mobile device usage globally. The latter increased by 8% as advertising spending grew and ad formats and delivery were further optimized for efficiency.\n\nYouTube ads revenue rose by 20.9% year-over-year to $8.1 billion during the first quarter. Just like for Google Search, higher advertising spend was a major contributor to this topline growth. Per Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler's opening remarks during the Q1 2024 Earnings Call, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months.\n\nCombine that with continued improvements in Shorts monetization and this is what was behind these excellent results. In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts compared to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months and improved by 10 points sequentially in the first quarter.\n\nGoogle Network revenue retreated by 1.1% over the year-ago period to $7.4 billion for the first quarter. This was fueled by a decrease in AdSense revenue during the quarter.\n\nGoogle's subscription, platforms, and devices revenue made its way 17.9% higher year-over-year to $8.7 billion during the first quarter. This was made possible by subscription services like Google One and YouTube Music Premium, each topping 100 million paid subscribers globally in the first quarter.\n\nFinally, Google Cloud revenue leaped 28.4% higher over the year-ago period to $9.6 billion for the first quarter. Growth in the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings were the elements that powered this topline growth for the company.\n\nMoving down the income statement, Google's diluted EPS soared 61.5% year-over-year to $1.89 during the first quarter. For context, this was $0.38 better than the Seeking Alpha consensus.\n\nA renewed focus on operating efficiency was at the heart of this improved profitability. A 5.1% reduction in employee headcount kept total expenses growth (+5.1%) in check versus revenue growth in the first quarter. This led to a 780 basis point expansion in Google's net profit margin to 29.4% during the quarter. Along with a 2.3% reduction in the outstanding diluted share count to 12.5 billion shares, this is how diluted EPS growth greatly outpaced revenue growth for the quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Google has its share of growth catalysts to sustain comfortably double-digit annual diluted EPS growth.\n\nIn Cloud, CEO Sundar Pichai noted in his opening remarks during the Q1 2024 Earnings Call that the company has announced more than 1,000 new products and features in recent months. This innovation is resonating with customers of all types. Pichai indicated that more than 60% of funded Gen AI startups and almost 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. More established businesses like PayPal are also choosing Google's infrastructure to meet their needs.\n\nDiscover Financial (DFS) has started to deploy Gen AI-driven tools, which are delivering faster resolution times to customers.\n\nFinally, Google rolled Gemini into Performance Max in February. According to Schindler, advertisers using the P-Max asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. Those same customers have seen 6% more conversions on average.\n\nSo, Google's continual improvements in conversions should keep leading to paid clicks and cost-per-click growth. That's why for 2024, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus projects that diluted EPS will be boosted by 29.7% to $7.53.\n\nIn 2025, the analyst consensus is for another 13.3% growth in diluted EPS to $8.52. For 2026, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus is for diluted EPS to increase by 14% to $9.72.\n\nGoogle Q1 2024 Earnings Press Release\n\nIf Google's exceptional business performance and growth prospects weren't enough, its financial positioning puts it over the top. As of March 31, the company had $94.9 billion in net cash and cash equivalents/marketable securities.\n\nPut another way, that's approximately $7.57 in net cash and cash equivalents/marketable securities for each outstanding share. This equates to 4%+ of the current $184 share price (as of June 26, 2024).\n\nThat substantial net cash position explains why Google maintains an AA+ credit rating from S&P on a stable outlook. This is a feat matched by only Apple (AAPL) and bested by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Microsoft (MSFT). So, Google arguably has one of the lowest risk balance sheets in the entire corporate world (unless otherwise sourced or hyperlinked, all details in this subhead were according to Google's Q1 2024 Earnings Press Release and Google's Q1 2024 10-Q Filing).\n\nFair Value Has Surpassed $200 A Share\n\nFAST Graphs, FactSet\n\nDespite Google's significant rally since I initiated coverage last November, I believe shares are still discounted. This is because the fundamentals of the business have gotten that much better in that time. For instance, the diluted EPS analyst estimates for 2024 and 2025 in my last article were just $6.69 and $7.79, respectively.\n\nCouple that with my fair value estimates moving from 2023 and 2024 into 2024 and 2025 and my fair value estimate now tops $200 a share.\n\nGoogle's shares are trading at a current-year P/E ratio of 24.4. This is just below the 10-year average P/E ratio of 25 per FAST Graphs.\n\nMoving forward, I think that a valuation multiple of 25 remains reasonable. That's because the company's three-year forward annual growth outlook of 16.4% is in line with the 10-year average of 18.2%.\n\nThe calendar year 2024 will be 50% complete in just a few days. So, that leaves 50% of 2024 and another 50% of 2025 remaining in the next 12 months. This is how I get a 12-month forward diluted EPS input of $8.03.\n\nApplying a valuation multiple of 25, I arrive at a fair value of $201 a share. Compared to the $184 share price, that equates to a 9% discount to fair value. If Google reverted to my fair value multiple and matched the growth consensus, it could produce 33% cumulative total returns through 2026.\n\nA Dividend Growth Juggernaut In The Making\n\nThe Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal\n\nGoogle's 0.4% dividend yield isn't going to win any favor with investors seeking immediate income. Given that I'm 27 years old, though, this one is right up my alley.\n\nThat is because, had Google also paid its current dividend in Q1, the EPS payout ratio would have been 10.6% in 2024. This is far below the 60% EPS payout ratio that rating agencies desire from Google's industry, per The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal.\n\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, the company generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter. Against the $15.7 billion in share repurchases, that still left $1.1 billion in excess free cash flow.\n\nNow, the quarterly dividend per share will consume approximately $2.5 billion each quarter. So, this is a free cash flow payout ratio of around 15%. These payout ratios and a nearly $100 billion net cash balance afford Google an enviable degree of flexibility to return capital to shareholders in the years to come (unless otherwise sourced, info was from Google's Q1 2024 Earnings Press Release).\n\nGoogle hasn't yet announced any dividend hikes. But for these reasons, I expect annual dividend growth at least in the mid-to high-teens annually for the foreseeable future.\n\nRisks To Consider\n\nGoogle is in every conceivable way among the best businesses on the planet. It still has risks, though.\n\nAs a tech giant, the biggest risk is obsolescence-related. As a leader in huge and growing addressable markets, the company has a big bullseye on its back. Thus far, Google's innovation has kept competitors at bay.\n\nIf the company can't keep out-innovating its peers, it risks losing market share. That could materially impact the growth prospects.\n\nAnother risk to Google is the potential for data privacy laws to be enacted in key markets around the world. If this happened, it could diminish the value proposition offered by the company to its advertising customers. That could weigh on Google's market share and future growth potential.\n\nJust as I noted in my previous article, one other risk for the company is its revolutionary founders themselves. Measured by voting power, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are still the majority owners of the company. If there are any strategic missteps allowed by the visionaries, it could harm Google's overall fundamental picture.\n\nSummary: The Next Great Dividend Growth Stock Remains A Buy\n\nGoogle is consistently increasing revenue, diluted EPS, and free cash flow. The balance sheet is an unquestionable fortress. Shares are also still modestly undervalued. Pair that with 30%+ cumulative total return potential through 2026 and that's why I'm updating coverage with a buy rating.\n\nGoogle is a company I'm glad to own as a next-generation dividend grower within my portfolio. My only regret is not buying more in the past 24 months. However, so long as the fundamentals hold up, I plan on further growing my weight in the coming months and years.",

        "body": "Thomas Pajot/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs individual investors, we have to take what the market gives us. We don't get to decide when stocks are on sale, whether they are overvalued, or what the macroeconomic and regulatory environment will be. All we can do is assess the current value and what the value of a business might be in the future. Historically, during most time periods, there has been some group of assets that were reasonably undervalued investors could put their money in for a good medium-term return. During the market peak in 2000, for example, bonds still offered a reasonably good value, and cigarette stocks, Berkshire, oil, industrials, and insurance stocks weren't as crazy overvalued as the rest of the market.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAs you can see, a sampling of those types of stocks above would have avoided the lost decade experienced by SPY and QQQ from 2000-2010 and actually performed reasonably well despite the lost decade.\n\nBut when we move our gaze from 2000 to 2022, we find a much more difficult investing environment. January 2022 was likely the beginning of a lost decade for most stocks and long-duration bonds, and real annual returns measured from that point in time are likely to be low-single digits at best during the following 5-10 years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe vast majority of stocks and bonds still haven't recovered their 2022 inflation-adjusted highs. The equal-weighted S&P 500 ETF (RSP) and equal-weighted Nasdaq 100 ETFs (QQQE) both have negative real returns, as does the popular dividend ETF (SCHD) and 60/40 fund (VBINX). Both bond funds (TLT) and (BND) are deeply negative as well so there was no safety to be found there.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nIt's true that the cap-weighted indices broke out above the rate of inflation this quarter, now producing a real annual return of +2.79% for SPY and +4.17% for QQQ on the backs of a few A.I. stocks, but we are not at the bottom of a cycle. With the Fed still holding interest rates near highs not seen for 15 years or more, it's much more likely we are closer to the top of an economic cycle than the bottom. When we zoom out, then, what we find is that the vast majority of stocks remain off their real 2022 peaks even though the market is far off its lows. Even a mild economic downturn would probably stretch out the time it takes the equal-weighted or 60/40 ETFs and portfolios to recover their 2022 values.\n\nMy take is that 2022 started a period of what I call \"fragile stagflation\". It's a period where there is structural inflation (rooted in geopolitical changes, demographics, and rising government deficits) that has periods of economic weakness such that real growth for business earnings isn't enough to support the 2022 stock valuations. Additionally, inflation will produce negative real long-duration bond returns for 5-10 years. This situation creates limited opportunities for investors.\n\nFortunately, short-duration treasury rates have risen to the point they are now higher than inflation, so there is an easy investment for investors to protect against the \"fragile\" part of \"fragile stagflation\". Since the start of 2023, I've been using iShares Treasury Floating Rate Bond ETF (TFLO) as a place to park my cash. This is cash which I would like to invest in stocks if I could buy the stocks at the right price.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nTFLO's return since 2022 slightly lags inflation, but will quickly surpass it during an economic slowdown or if inflation simply slows enough. These aren't great returns, of course, but at least they 1) have downside protection, and 2) are better than the average stock returns during this period.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAlso, since I started using TFLO at the start of 2023, it has produced positive real returns above that of inflation.\n\nHow I'm Investing For Fragile Stagflation\n\nThe two main dynamics of fragile stagflation are that we have elevated inflation in the 3-4% range that is periodically interrupted by stretches of economic weakness. The economic weakness may, or may not, result in a full-blown recession. This creates a situation where most medium and long-term government bonds are unattractive as investments due to the relatively high underlying inflation (I consider 3% to 4% annual inflation this decade to be \"relatively high\" compared to the Fed's 2% stated target.) The stocks of high-quality businesses that have the ability to pass inflation on to their customers can be attractive in this environment, but only if they are purchased at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the stocks of most easily identifiable high-quality businesses are not trading at valuations that allow for a high probability of good returns. (As a baseline for what I mean by \"good\", I aim for returns of an 8% CAGR plus inflation at the portfolio level, but I think 6% plus inflation at the index level would still be considered \"good\" for the market.)\n\nI've found that most of my new purchases fall into three categories. The first is short-term treasuries that yield more than inflation like (TFLO). This provides a yield greater than inflation while also giving me cash to invest during the \"fragile\" market downturns. I've had roughly 1/3 of my portfolio in TFLO since the start of 2023. The next category of stocks where I've found most of my new investments is in fast-growth businesses, usually small and midcaps. These stocks are more volatile but they have long-term growth potential that can significantly outpace inflation or economic stagnation. And third, I've recently been picking up some deep cyclical stocks that are -50% to -65% off their highs. These types of stocks, again, can be very volatile, but if the economic and industry downturns turn out to be shallower than that of a full recession, these cyclicals could produce the 100% to 200% medium-term returns that most other stocks in the market have no chance of achieving. I have also been finding more international opportunities than usual since the US dollar has been fairly strong. So, if the dollar weakens, I could get a portfolio boost from that as well. Even though my cash level has remained between 30% and 40% during this time, I made about 40 stock purchases during the past two years, so I've managed to find about 2 stocks per month. The cash levels have remained relatively steady because I have sold about the same number of positions I've bought by regularly increasing the quality threshold of the stocks I continue to hold. In the next section, I'll share five stocks I recently sold as part of this process.\n\n5 Stocks I Recently Sold\n\nJust as changing conditions have caused me to lean into the barbell strategy I described in the last section with TFLO on one end and more growth-oriented stocks on the other, I've been regularly selling some stocks as well. Some of these I think the easy money has probably been made from mean reversion, and others my theses didn't work out or I paid too much, or a combination of both. Since I've written public articles on all these for Seeking Alpha, I wanted to disclose these recent sales and my reasoning for selling them.\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nI first bought Comcast stock 2/28/20 at the beginning of the March 2020 crash. I expected their internet business might be enough to offset losses in cable and that parks and movies would eventually have a strong recovery. I most recently wrote about Comcast stock as a buy on Seeking Alpha 2 years ago on 6/24/22 in my article \"Comcast Stock Is A Very Attractive Buying Opportunity Relative To The Rest Of The Market\". Here is how the stock has performed since that article:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWhile the nominal returns were positive and it performed similarly to the S&P 500 until 6 months ago, I think there is simply too much competition right now for most of their business segments. Obviously streaming is crowded and cable is slowly dying, but the internet has more and more competition as well. For example, I have a smaller fiber provider I use that has been far better in every respect than any cable internet provider I've ever had. There is also competition from Starlink and wireless phone providers. So, while I don't think there is a lot of scary downside danger with the stock, I also don't think there is the potential for the relatively big rewards I want with most of my positions. I would rather take my chances on the businesses with more long-term growth potential.\n\nOne of the secondary theses I had with Comcast was that it was a better choice than Disney (DIS), and that thesis has played out better. Since my video \"Why Selling Disney And Buying Comcast Is A Wise Move\" published 2/15/21 on my YouTube channel, CMCSA has outperformed Disney by quite a lot even if the returns weren't good.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSo, overall, my personal Comcast position, and my Comcast published articles and videos weren't total disasters, but haven't produced good returns, and probably have limited medium-term upside.\n\nGlobal Payments Network (GPN)\n\nI first purchased GPN on 1/4/22 and wrote about it on Seeking Alpha on 7/8/22 about two years ago in my article \"Even If We Have A Recession, Global Payments Has A Good Risk/Reward Over The Medium Term\". It has performed quite poorly since then.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThere were some signs that the stock would at least keep pace with the S&P 500 average, but recently it has experienced more weakness. I think the main mistake I made here was using adjusted earnings for my valuation rather than basic earnings.\n\nMy default is to use adjusted operating earnings when performing valuations because usually, the long historical time-frames I examine are enough time to see most bad or inaccurate adjustments by management work themselves out. However, an exception to this guideline is the case of big M&A. If a company has some bad M&A, it often takes a few years for those write-downs to appear, so my old rule was to wait three years after big M&A before considering buying a stock (usually after a sell-off).\n\nThe big picture dynamic of this problem is that usually what happens is natural organic growth for a business slows as the total addressable market is addressed. The managers of the company are aware of the issue before anyone else is. Also, managers of competitors or similar businesses likely are seeing the same thing. This is just the normal pattern of the life-cycle of a typical business, but because investors are often using the recent historical earnings growth of the business to estimate future returns, if that growth slows, then the stock price often falls and investors usually lose money over the medium term. Not only does this reduce the value of any stock-based compensation many of these companies pay executives, but it also can potentially threaten the jobs of management because it's rare for them to be pessimistic about the future, and they then get blamed if growth slows and the stock prices drop. So what managments can do is merge with competitors, or buy them out, and maybe get more pricing power that way over the longer term. Often, after the M&A, earnings adjustments can rationally be made, and adjusted earnings can grow in a similar pattern as in the past for a while. This keeps investors happy, and all is well.\n\nIn early 2016 GPN first merged with Heartland Payment Systems in a $4.3 billion deal, and then in 2019, GPN had another merger deal with Total System for $21.5 billion. These were huge deals for GPN.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThey account for more than the current market cap of the business. We can also see the shares outstanding bumps that were made when these deals occurred.\n\nNext let's look at what happened to the deviation of adjusted earnings compared to basic earnings during this time.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nIf we look at the historical adjusted earnings per share everything looks great for GPN, with EPS rising at a good rate every year except 2020 during COVID. Basic EPS tells a different story, though.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nBasic EPS looks much more challenged during this period and took a nose-dive in 2022. What I think is important here is the deviation between the two since 2015, the year before the big M&A started. That year basic EPS was $2.08 while adjusted was $2.43. Adjusted was only about 17% higher than basic. In 2023, basic EPS was $3.78 while adjusted was $10.42. This is a 175% difference between the two. I think what we are seeing with the recent price movement in GPN is that the market is losing faith in those adjusted EPS numbers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GPN does have a significant amount of debt as well, with long-term debt to capital at about 38%. So, while the current P/E of around 9 using adjusted earnings looks attractive, if we include the debt, then that is up over 12. And if we use basic earnings the P/E is 25 using 2023's earnings. So, this stock might not be as cheap as it appears.\n\nWhile I was aware of these general dynamics when I bought the stock, but I don't think I took them seriously enough at the time. I've become more vigilant as of late when it comes to businesses trying to adapt to slowing growth in their industry by initiating M&A. My inclination now is to avoid these situations altogether.\n\nFidelity Information Systems (FIS)\n\nIn many respects, FIS has been in a similar situation as GPN. The main difference is that I bought FIS after a big sell-off and wrote about it on 11/7/22 in my article \"I Bought The Crash In Fidelity National Information Services\". This purchase has performed better.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nFIS bought Sunguard in 2015 in a $9.1 billion deal, and then an even bigger purchase of Worldpay for $35 billion. For brevity's sake, I won't post more FAST Graphs but basic EPS in 2014 was $2.38 compared to $3.10 for adjusted earnings. By 2021 basic EPS had fallen to $.68 while adjusted was $6.55. FIS would later spin off the failed Worldpay last year.\n\nFortunately, I didn't pay too much for this stock and managed a decent profit, but I think they are still in a challenging growth environment and I prefer to own the stocks of businesses where growth can come a little easier, so I sold.\n\nBristol Myers (BMY)\n\nI bought this stock on 12/14/20. With big pharma stocks, I expect them to make acquisitions, but I also expect that given enough time, they have some promising breakout products that result from their own R&D and acquisitions, and after nearly 4 years BMY simply hasn't done that. After they recently decided it was necessary to make even more acquisitions (about $25 billion worth last year) I decided it was time to sell. While it's possible they could see growth in the coming years, after a decade of stock price stagnation, I would rather focus my energy on investments I think are more predictable.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nUMB Financial (UMBF)\n\nI first bought UMBF during the March 2020 crash. I took profits in January 2022 for a 138% gain, so that investment went really well. I then bought again after the March 2023 banking crisis and wrote the article \"Post Crash UMB Financial Stock Has A Good Risk/Reward\" on 4/29/23. Since then, the stock has performed reasonably well:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nI think the overreaction the market had due to the risk of customer deposit flight has mostly corrected now and we see that the stock has been trading in a tight range lately. Now I think given the risks that still remain in commercial real estate and the bigger economic cycle in general, the stock is probably priced correctly by the market over the medium term, so I'm going to take profits here since there is a good chance the economy is more late-cycle than mid-cycle and I want to reduce financially sensitive positions unless I feel there is a big reward possible.\n\nConclusion\n\nPortfolio housekeeping is rarely a fun task. One usually has to be willing to admit that certain positions are not performing quite as well as expected. In addition to these sales, I also sold 4 REITs, again, with the goal of reducing financially sensitive positions. I think the key component of this sort of housekeeping is to be as consistent as possible with the standards one uses. For example, I didn't just sell the stocks of positions that had negative returns. In fact, my average return for this group was slightly positive. It's really about assessing the risk compared to the potential reward. Most of the stocks I sold during this round of portfolio housekeeping I think have limited medium-term growth potential along with higher than average financial sensitivity either due to the type of business they are, or things like higher debt levels. So, it was a mix of my macro view of \"fragile stagflation\", the profile of the individual stocks, and how the rest of my portfolio is positioned that ultimately led to the decision to sell.

        "body": "PeopleImages\n\nI'm excited to tell you about three of my favorite high yield blue-chip ideas, which I've been buying hand over fist recently.\n\nI've tripled my share count in June alone in some of these companies.\n\nLet me share with you the reasons that I believe now is the time to buy British American (BTI), Enbridge (ENB), and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) before Wall Street catches onto their incredible short and long-term investment opportunities.\n\nDividend Kings Zen Research Terminal\n\nThree blue chips yielding an average of 7%, growing almost 10% per year, which are 19% undervalued, and whose fundamentals justify a 32% upside in the next year.\n\nWhy I'm Buying Enbridge With Both Hands\n\nEnbridge is the ultimate buy-and-hold forever midstream, the most utility-like name in the industry.\n\nEnbridge\n\nEnbridge has sold off in recent weeks, pushing the yield to historical extremes after suffering a six-day losing streak.\n\nYCharts\n\nEnbridge's peak yield of 8.1% in October 2022 was reached when interest rates were soaring, and some economists estimated that the Fed would have to hike rates as high as 7%.\n\nThe all-time high of 8.84% yield was reached on April 20, 2020.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nThere is one reason I can find that might explain this.\n\nA 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled Monday that a state court must decide the future of Enbridge's Line 5 segment through the Straits of Mackinac, The Detroit News reported. This overturned a lower federal court decision that said the issue belonged in federal court... The three-judge panel ruled that Enbridge had missed a procedural window for filing to remove the case to federal court; the case was filed in state court in 2019, but the company did not try to remove it to federal court until 2021, long past the 30-day deadline for removal.\" Seeking Alpha\n\nEnbridge doesn't break out the exact cash flow from Line 5, but it makes up 17% of its crude oil transport capacity. Since 50% of revenue is currently from crude oil transport, we can ballpark an 8% cash flow risk should Line 5 be shut down.\n\nWhy I'm Not Worried About Line 5: Enbridge Will Likely Win In The End\n\nEven if Enbridge loses the court ruling, it can appeal, possibly to the Supreme Court, and it may likely win.\n\nAny order to shut down Line 5 could be stayed by a federal court injunction, ensuring ENB's cash flow from Line 5 doesn't get cut off.\n\nThe Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada Concerning Transit Pipelines, also known as the Transit Pipeline Treaty, was signed in 1977 and entered into force on Oct. 1, 1977.\n\nKey points about this treaty include:\n\nIt aims to ensure the uninterrupted transmission of hydrocarbons by pipeline through one country's territory for delivery to the other country. The treaty includes provisions for dispute resolution, including arbitration, if negotiations fail.\n\nIn the Line 5 pipeline dispute, Canada has invoked the treaty to argue against Michigan's attempts to shut down the pipeline. The Canadian government contends that shutting down Line 5 would violate the 1977 treaty.\n\nMichigan's state government is up against the Canadian government in a treaty dispute over the safety of Line 5, which Enbridge is attempting to replace with a new pipeline.\n\nNational Wildlife Federation\n\nThe company proposes to build a $500 million tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a new pipeline segment, claiming it would enhance safety. Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down Line 5, citing environmental and safety concerns.\n\nEnbridge maintains that shutting down Line 5 would have severe economic consequences and violate the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Biden administration has recently weighed in, urging a federal appeals court to reconsider a lower court's order to shut down part of Line 5.\n\nThe Canadian and US governments are against shutting down Line 5.\n\nArticle VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (known as the Supremacy Clause) states that treaties, the Constitution, and federal laws are the \"supreme law of the Land.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is highly likely to rule in favor of Canada, the US federal government, and Enbridge in any dispute between Michigan's state courts in this dispute.\n\nThe Facts Are on Enbridge's Side\n\n\"Enbridge has spilled over 1 million gallons of oil from Line 5!\" That is the claim made by environmentalists, and it's true. But completely out of context.\n\nLine 5 was constructed in 1953 by the Bechtel Corporation.\n\nThe pipeline has been operating \"without incident at the Straits of Mackinac for more than 65 years,\" according to Enbridge.\n\nAll oil pipelines will have occasional spills, but ENB has never spilled into the straights, and the \"1 million gallons\" over a 65-year lifetime works out to:\n\nEnbridge has spilled over 24,000 barrels of oil from Line 5 through 30 incidents over 65 years.\n\nThat's averaging one spill every two years, averaging less than 1,000 barrels each.\n\nDetermine the total number of days in 65 years:\n\n65 years \u00d7 365 days/year = 23,725 days\n\nAccounting for leap years: 65 years / 4 = 16.25 (approximately 16 leap years)\n\nTotal days including leap years: 23,725 + 16 = 23,741 days\n\nCalculate the total oil transported: Daily transport capacity: 540,000 barrels/day Total oil transported: 23,741 days \u00d7 540,000 barrels/day = 12,820,140,000 barrels\n\nContextualize the spilled oil: Total spilled oil: 23,810 barrels Percentage of total transported oil that was spilled:(23,810 barrels12,820,140,000 barrels)\u00d7100\u22480.000186%\n\n\n\nThis means that one out of 537,634.4 barrels ENB transports through line 5 is spilled.\n\nHow does that compare to industry norms? How about the alternative? Train or trucking oil transport?\n\nPipelines experienced 0.049 occurrences per million barrels of oil equivalent transported, compared to 0.227 for rail.\n\nRoad transport had the highest incident rate at 19.95 per billion-ton miles per year, followed by rail at 2.08, natural gas pipelines at 0.89, and hazardous liquid pipelines at 0.58.\n\nStatistically, pipelines are 4.5X safer than rail transport and 40X safer than road transport.\n\nEnbridge plans to build a $500-plus million tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a replacement segment of Line 5.\n\nThe tunnel would be bored through rock, up to 100 feet below the lake bed, providing an extra layer of safety.\n\nIt's designed to eliminate the risk of an anchor strike, considered the greatest threat to the current pipeline.\n\nIn other words, ENB is trying to improve a pipeline operating very safely for 65 years, minimizing the risk of a spill that opponents are trying to shut down entirely.\n\nLine 5 has never spilled into the straights; ENB's safety record in the disputed area is 100%.\n\nLine 5 is an example of \"NIMBYism,\" or not in my backyard.\n\nPipelines are the safest transport method until the world transitions off oil. Yet, they want to shut it down when even the Biden Administration, hardly a fan of pipelines or big oil, has taken a nuanced position and is opposed to a knee-jerk reaction to shut down the pipeline.\n\nWhat If Enbridge Loses And Line 5 Is Shut Down?\n\nFirst, let's talk about dividend safety.\n\nYear Distributable Cash Flow Annual Dividends/Share Total Annual Dividends Payout Ratio 2023 $8,370 $2.64 $5,491.20 65.6% 2024 $8,796 $2.68 $5,574.40 63.4% 2025 $9,163 $2.76 $5,740.80 62.7% 2026 $9,526 $2.85 $5,928.00 62.2% 2027 $10,231 $2.96 $6,156.80 60.2% 2028 $10,842 $3.05 $6,344.00 58.5% 2029 $11,493 $3.15 $6,552.00 57.0% Annual Growth 5.4% 3.0% 3.0% -2.3% Click to enlarge\n\n(Source: FactSet Research)\n\nENB management targets a 60% to 70% payout ratio policy, and if Line 5 were shut down overnight, its payout ratio would likely rise to 71%.\n\nRating agencies consider 83% a safe payout ratio for this industry due to the long-term contracted nature of these pipelines.\n\nENB operates under \"take or pay\" contracts, in which if an oil company doesn't ship a single barrel, it still pays 100% of the agreed-upon revenue. These contracts secure capacity, and that's why ENB has such stable cash flow during oil crises.\n\nEnbridge\n\nThat's why ENB has a 29-year dividend growth streak and an international aristocrat has raised the dividend yearly since 1995.\n\nDebunking Recent FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)\n\nI can quickly debunk claims that Enbridge's steady debt and share count growth represent an unsustainable dividend.\n\nYCharts\n\nAmerican States Water (AWR) has the longest dividend streak in the world at 69 years and typically has negative free cash flow every year.\n\nYCharts\n\nMy god! AWR is funding its dividends with debt and printing shares!\n\nYCharts\n\nSomehow, Wall Street has missed AWR's unsustainable business and dividend since its founding in 1929.\n\nAlmost 100 years of unsustainable dividends!\n\nOr how about York Water (YORW)? York has an extraordinary dividend record that is unmatched in the United States. Here are the critical details about York Water's dividend history:\n\nConsecutive dividend payments: York Water has paid dividends for 613 consecutive quarters, translating to over 208 years of uninterrupted dividend payments.\n\nSurely, we can all agree that something that has continued for 208 years is not \"unsustainable,\" correct?\n\nYCharts\n\nFor 208 years, YORW has generated cumulative negative free cash flow.\n\nYCharts\n\nIts debt is up 400% since 1995!\n\nYCharts\n\nYORW periodically issues significant shares, up to 10% dilution at a time!\n\nYCharts\n\nWall Street has completely missed that YORW's debt/share issuance funded dividends have been unsustainable for 208 years.\n\nFactSet\n\nS&P has completely missed this \"obvious\" fact, too!\n\nAmerican States Water? It's A+ rated by S&P, and Golden State Water Company, an American States Water Company subsidiary, has an A+/A2 debt rating from Moody's!\n\nHow about Realty Income (O), another A-rated dividend aristocrat with a 32-year dividend growth streak?\n\nYCharts\n\nHow about Federal Realty (FRT), the only dividend king in REITdom with a 56-year \"Unsustainable.\" debt and share printing funded record?\n\nYCharts\n\nHow can \"unsustainable\" dividends possibly continue for decades or even 208 years? How can rating agencies, bond investors, analysts, and Wall Street investors miss this?\n\nIt's simple. Debt and equity issuances have always been part of utilities' and REITs' sustainable business models.\n\nAnyone who discusses debt or share issuances in these sectors without mentioning cash flow per share or debt ratios is either ignorant of the business model or trying to scare you into thinking these are unsustainable businesses.\n\nEnbridge\n\nDebt is irrelevant; debt/EBITDA is very relevant.\n\nInterest payments are meaningless, and interest coverage ratios are critical.\n\nENB's leverage ratio has been falling for years and is now firmly under the 5X safety limit rating agencies want to see for investment grade midstream.\n\nBy the way, rating agencies allow utilities to have 6X debt/EBITDA ratios due to the stability of their regulated cash flow.\n\nAmerican States Water has $913 million in debt?! What does that mean? 4.03X debt/EBITDA!\n\nBut given the context of what safe debt for utilities is, should investors be worried? Should income investors believe that a 69-year dividend growth streak and 95 years of uninterrupted dividends are at risk?\n\nEnbridge: 70 Years Of Uninterrupted Dividends\n\nDividend streak: Enbridge has paid dividends to its shareholders for 70 years, an uninterrupted dividend streak that has been maintained since at least 1954.\n\nENB was founded in 1949. In 1981, it experienced interest rates as high as 20%. It financed its business with 10-year yields as high as 16%.\n\n\"Higher for longer will kill ENB!\" does not back up the facts or ENB's actual business model.\n\nCME Group\n\nThe bond market is now pricing an 81% chance of four rate cuts in the next year.\n\nFactSet Research\n\nRating agencies, bond investors, management, analysts, and Wall Street all think ENB's business is sustainable.\n\nFactSet Research\n\nBond investors bought 4.1% yielding 100-year bonds ENB sold in 2012. Today, with rates 5% higher, those bonds yield 5.35%.\n\nNot even the US government could sell 100-year bonds at 5.35% yields. Not bad for an \"unsustainable\" business!\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong With Enbridge\n\nEnbridge is not risk-free; no company is. Many things could go wrong with this business.\n\nS&P\n\nMost businesses can experience over 1,000 problems, and according to S&P, ENB is at the top of its industry and the world in managing risks.\n\nLT Risk Management Score Rating 0% to 9% Very Poor 10% to 19% Poor 20% to 29% Suboptimal 30% to 59% Acceptable 60% to 69% Good 70% to 79% Very Good 80+% Exceptional ENB 72% Global Percentile 99% Click to enlarge\n\n(Source: S&P)\n\nHowever, some things could go wrong with ENB in the short to medium term.\n\nYear Debt/EBITDA Net Debt/EBITDA (5 Or Less Safe According To Credit Rating Agencies) Interest Coverage (2+ Safe) 2023 4.93 4.66 3.18 2024 5.36 5.49 3.11 2025 5.19 5.31 2.63 2026 5.01 5.18 2.74 Annualized Change 0.5% 3.6% -4.8% Click to enlarge\n\n(Source: FactSet)\n\nIf Line 5 were shut down, an 8% decrease in cash flow would push ENB's leverage ratios to levels that could cause a downgrade to BBB or even BBB-.\n\nThe dividend would remain well covered (71% payout ratio). However, the 3% dividend growth expectation might fall to 1% as management has to focus on de-leveraging.\n\nWe must also remember that ENB is closing on the third of its three major utility acquisitions, and digesting three major acquisitions is always fraught with execution risk.\n\nENB's growth risk is not \"can it grow?\" There's minimal risk of ENB suffering negative growth over the long term.\n\nEnbridge\n\nThe risk is \"how fast can ENB grow\" and what that means for its valuations.\n\nFactSet\n\nFAST Graphs, FactSet\n\nWhen ENB grew at 15% to 20% per year, it often traded at 2% to 3% yields.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nManagement is now guiding for 12% to 13% long-term returns, similar to its long-term norms. However, if growth slows to 1% to 3%, then ENB's multiple could continue to compress as income investors demand their 12% to 13% in the form of a higher yield.\n\nFor example, if ENB's growth prospects fell to 3%, its yield might drift from 9% to 10% for investors to get their expected 12% to 13% return.\n\nIf ENB did not grow, Wall Street might demand a 12% to 13% yield from its shares, representing potentially significant downside risk.\n\nI'm confident that ENB's long-term yield will be closer to 7% to 7.5%, but if I'm wrong, I will buy more as long as the thesis remains intact.\n\nFAST Graphs, FactSet\n\nWhy I'm Buying British American With Both Hands\n\nI've covered British American's thesis extensively, and today, I wanted to share a few key facts in this short update.\n\nFirst, Wednesday, June 26, was the last day to buy British Americans for the next dividend.\n\nThat, combined with its recent weakness, is why I decided to buy more than 6,400 shares in June via a combination of limits and market buys.\n\nThat means I tripled my position in BTI because my conviction in the thesis is stronger than ever.\n\nFactSet\n\nBTI's growth consensus is 8.3%, well above management's 4% to 6% guidance, which still represents 13.5% to 15.5% total return guidance.\n\nIf analysts are correct, BTI could deliver 18% to 19% long-term returns.\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong With British American\n\nBTI was trading flat over the past year before its recent rally.\n\nYCharts\n\nThat's due to several headwinds, including higher rates for longer, causing management to put the buybacks on pause.\n\nHigher inflation in the US caused cigarette volume declines to double for Altria (MO) and British American (BTI) to about 9% to 11%.\n\nAnd California's menthol ban risked BTI's vaping business losing market share to illegal, non-regulated rivals, which has been a challenge according to management.\n\nWhen big tech is delivering clockwork-like super growth, investors were leery of BTI and the potential to announce disappointing earnings. Specifically, volume declines that might cause management to reduce guidance.\n\nBTI's pre-earnings trading update reiterated guidance for this year and the long term.\n\nHere's a summary of the pre-earnings trading update.\n\nFinancial Performance:\n\nBTI is on track to deliver its guidance of low single-digit revenue and adjusted profit from operations growth on an organic constant currency basis in 2024.\n\nPerformance is expected to be second-half weighted due to inventory movements and phasing of new product launches.\n\nOn an organic constant currency basis, first half revenue and adjusted profit from operations will decrease in the low single digits.\n\nCash Flow and Capital Allocation:\n\nBAT expects to deliver an operating cash flow conversion of over 90% in 2024.\n\nThe company has initiated a sustainable share buyback program, starting with \u00a3700 million in 2024 and \u00a3900 million in 2025.\n\nThey're progressing on deleveraging and expect to be within their narrowed target range of 2-2.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2024.\n\nDividend Implications:\n\nThe company's focus on deleveraging and maintaining financial flexibility is favorable for long-term dividend sustainability.\n\nMarket Performance:\n\nThe group's combustible volume share is up 30 basis points, driven by good performance in the AME and APMEA regions.\n\nThe US market remains challenging, with industry volume down around 9% year-to-date.\n\nNew categories, particularly in vapor and modern oral, continue to show growth and improved profitability.\n\nFuture Outlook:\n\nBAT expects an acceleration in group volume, revenue, and profit performance in the year's second half.\n\nThe company targets 3%-5% revenue growth and mid-single digit adjusted profit from operations growth on an organic constant currency basis by 2026.\n\nStrategic Focus:\n\nBAT emphasizes \"Quality Growth\" to drive a more balanced top and bottom-line performance.\n\nThe company continues to invest in new product innovations across all categories.\n\nWhile facing some near-term challenges, particularly in the US market, BAT focuses on cash generation, deleveraging, and returning capital to shareholders through buybacks. This, combined with their strategic investments in new categories and focus on profitability, suggests a continued commitment to supporting their dividend over the long term.\n\nS&P recently upgraded BTI's credit rating from BBB+ negative outlook to stable and BBB+ stable, and they are potentially on track to get an A-credit rating within a few years.\n\nS&P's recent upgrade is due to steadily improving leverage and S&P's confidence that reduced-risk products (RRPs) will grow at 15% to 20% per year.\n\nThat would align with the management guidance for 33% RRP sales by 2030 and 50% by 2035.\n\nThis is S&P's forecast for BTI in the short term. It represents a solid improvement in its risk profile as it achieves steadily higher sales from non-tobacco products.\n\nExtrapolating BTI's Glide-Path To A Smoke-Free Future\n\nYear Total Sales New Products (RRPs) Sales % Of Total Sales 2023 $34,392 $5,159 15.0% 2024 $33,707 $5,933 17.6% 2025 $34,825 $6,823 19.6% 2026 $36,087 $7,846 21.7% 2027 $37,428 $9,023 24.1% 2028 $38,555 $10,376 26.9% 2029 $39,442 $11,933 30.3% 2030 $40,349 $13,723 34.0% 2031 $41,277 $15,232 36.9% 2032 $42,226 $16,908 40.0% 2033 $43,198 $18,767 43.4% 2034 $44,191 $20,832 47.1% 2035 $45,207 $23,123 51.1% 2036 $46,247 $24,973 54.0% 2037 $47,311 $26,971 57.0% 2038 $48,399 $29,129 60.2% 2039 $49,512 $31,459 63.5% 2040 $50,651 $33,976 67.1% 2041 $51,816 $35,674 68.8% 2042 $53,008 $37,458 70.7% 2043 $54,227 $39,331 72.5% 2044 $55,474 $41,298 74.4% 2045 $56,750 $43,362 76.4% 2046 $58,055 $45,531 78.4% 2047 $59,391 $47,807 80.5% 2048 $60,757 $50,197 82.6% 2049 $62,154 $52,707 84.8% 2050 $63,584 $55,343 87.0% 2051 $65,046 $58,110 89.3% 2052 $66,542 $61,015 91.7% 2053 $68,072 $64,066 94.1% 2054 $69,638 $67,269 96.6% 2055 $71,240 $70,633 99.1% Click to enlarge\n\n(Source: FactSet, S&P, Management guidance)\n\nS&P 15% (low-end) RRP growth through 2030.\n\n11% growth from 2031 to 2035 (management 50% sales guidance).\n\n8% from 2036 to 2040 (PM's 66% by 2030, 10 years later for BTI).\n\n5% from 2041 onward (current global nicotine market growth rate).\n\nBased on all management guidance and estimates from analysts and S&P, here's a plausible glide path for BTI to achieve 100% non-tobacco sales globally by 2056 and 100% US sales by 2053.\n\nBTI is two years ahead of previous management guidance on RRPs, which was for 5% of RRP sales in 2023, with profitability in 2025.\n\nBTI hit 15% RRP sales in 2023 and broke even in Q4 2023. It now expects around 400 million pounds of profit from RRP 900 million in 2025 and 1.6 billion in 2026.\n\nA pack of 20 cigarettes (equivalent; a standard pack contains 25 sticks in Australia) now costs roughly $26, well above the $19 retail price for a premium pack in the UK, $8 in the US, and around $6 on average globally, according to the World Health Organization. Assuming the Australian experience applies to price elasticity in other markets, it appears a great deal of headroom remains for price increases globally. At 4% real pricing (based on 6% nominal price/mix and 2% global inflation), this crude calculation suggests that it will be 2046 before global pricing reaches levels at which price elasticity increased in Australia. This is comfortably longer than 20 years, the benchmark period that we expect wide-moat companies to continue generating economic rent.\" - Morningstar\n\nMorningstar estimates it will be 22 years before BTI can raise prices to match volume declines. That would be when they're likely to close to 80% of sales from RRPs, and tobacco will no longer be a significant risk for investors.\n\nMorningstar's model estimates a return to 5% volume declines, and if BTI's volume declines are higher than that, it might have to move more quickly to a smoke-free future or else miss that 4% to 6% growth guidance.\n\nIn the short term, worries about US regulations regarding menthol and nicotine levels might still weigh on BTI. Still, with buybacks now underway and the risk of a significant earnings disappointment gone, I'm very comfortable overweighting British American.\n\nFAST Graphs, FactSet\n\nWhy I'm Buying Brookfield And Setting Limits For More\n\nToday's update on Brookfield is about something I noticed when building out some of our new tools.\n\nBrookfield has disappointed some investors.\n\nBrookfield has been relatively flat this year, while the S&P is up 15%, and Nvidia has almost tripled.\n\nCharlie Bilello\n\nThe S&P is having its 13th-best and best presidential election year ever.

        "body": "AlbertoChagas\n\nAs you may have noticed, I recently wrote an article titled \"Who Else Is Avoiding These 3 High Yielding REITs?\"\n\nIn this article, I highlighted three REITs that I'm avoiding:\n\nGranite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (GPMT)\n\nService Properties Trust ( SVC )\n\nSVC Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL).\n\nTo be clear, I'm not against owning high yielding REITs.\n\nIn fact, I own several of them, which is the topic of my article today.\n\nI prefer safer names like Realty Income Corporation (O), VICI Properties (VICI), and Agree Realty (ADC), just to name a few.\n\nHowever, I maintain modest exposure to these high yielders which I will tell you about now.\n\nArbor Realty Trust, Inc. (ABR)\n\nArbor Realty is an internally managed mortgage REIT, or mREIT, that specializes in originating, investing, and managing commercial real estate loans and assets. The company operates through 2 segments: its Structured Business and its Agency Business.\n\nThe company\u2019s Structured Business primarily offers bridge loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine financing, single-family rental (\u201cSFR\u201d) permanent loans, and preferred equity investments.\n\nBridge loans constitute the vast majority of the company\u2019s structured portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, 97% of ABR\u2019s structured portfolio consisted of bridge loans, accounting for 698 of its 781 portfolio loans.\n\nABR\u2019s bridge loans have an unpaid principal balance (\u201cUPB\u201d) of $11.9 billion, a W.A. pay rate of 8.11%, a W.A. remaining maturity of just under a year, and a W.A. last dollar loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratio of 81%.\n\nMezzanine loans make up 2% of the company\u2019s structured portfolio with a UPB of $260.4 million, followed by preferred equity and SFR loans which represent 1% and < 1%, respectively.\n\nABR - IR\n\nABR\u2019s portfolio of structured finance assets is secured by multiple property types, primarily multifamily, which represents 87% of its portfolio, but also single-family rental and land.\n\nThe company\u2019s portfolio is also diversified by geographic location. Its largest state is Texas, which represents 23% of its portfolio, followed by Florida, which represents 17%.\n\nABR - IR\n\nThe company\u2019s Agency Business originates, sells, and services various multifamily debt products through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, collectively known as government-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d), as well as Ginnie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD.\n\nArbor Realty retains almost all the servicing rights on the loans it originates and sells under the GSE and HUD programs, which enables the company to collect MSR fees through its Agency Business.\n\nAdditionally, ABR originates and sells debt products through conduit programs where mortgages are pooled, securitized, and sold as commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d). At the end of 1Q-24, the company\u2019s Agency Business servicing portfolio totaled approximately $31.4 billion.\n\nABR - IR\n\nArbor released its 1Q-24 operating results in May and reported net interest income (\u201cNII\u201d) during the quarter of $103.6 million, compared to NII of $108.6 million in the first quarter of last year.\n\nTotal other revenue, which includes mortgage serving rights, fee-based services, servicing revenue, and property operating income, was reported at $57.0 million during the first quarter, compared to total other revenue of $73.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP net income during the 1Q-24 was reported at $57.9 million, or EPS of $0.31, compared with GAAP net income of $84.3 million, or EPS of $0.46 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the company declared a dividend of $0.43 per share and reported distributable earnings of $0.48 per share, which does not include a $1.6 million realized loss taken on a non-performing loan.\n\nAnalysts expect 2024 earnings to come in at $1.75 per share, representing a -22% decline in EPS year-over-year. In 2025 analyst expect marginal growth with projections for EPS to increase by +1%.\n\nFAST Graphs (compiled by iREIT\u00ae)\n\nLike most other mortgage REITs, Arbor has had to deal with an uptick in loan defaults given the rapid pace in which interest rates have recently risen. This has negatively impacted its earnings, but we believe this is a temporary headwind and that ABR\u2019s long-term growth trend will continue once interest rates and the lending environment normalizes.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2023, Arbor\u2019s normalized EPS increased each year, except for in 2017, and the company delivered a compound annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) of 21.9% over this period.\n\nTIKR.com\n\nWe see an opportunity here as ABR stock currently offers an earnings yield of 14.15% and a dividend yield of 12.11%.\n\nThe stock is trading under its average P/E of 8.28x with a current P/E ratio of 7.07x and the dividend is sufficiently covered with a 2023 dividend payout ratio of 74.67% and an expected 2024 dividend payout ratio of roughly 98%.\n\nThe 2024 expected dividend payout ratio is tight. However, we feel that ABR will return to growth once the lending environment has normalized, and that the company will maintain its dividend until that time.\n\nThere is always a risk that the current interest rate environment may last longer than expected, which would continue to pressure ABR\u2019s portfolio, but so long as conditions normalize over the next 1\u20132 years, we think ABR\u2019s operations will return to normal and that it will be able to maintain its dividend until that time.\n\nWe rate Arbor Realty Trust a Tier 2 Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nStarwood Property Trust, Inc. (STWD)\n\nSTWD is a mortgage REIT that primarily specializes in the origination, acquisition, financing and management of a mortgage loan portfolio and related investments in the U.S., Europe, and Australia.\n\nThe company operates under 4 business segments, which include:\n\nReal estate commercial and residential lending\n\nInfrastructure lending\n\nReal estate property, and\n\nReal estate investing and servicing.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, Starwood\u2019s assets totaled $26.1 billion. Commercial loans made up 58% of the company\u2019s asset base and included loans for multifamily, office, hotel, mixed use, retail and industrial properties.\n\nWithin its commercial loan segment, multifamily is the company\u2019s largest property type and represents 21% of its total asset base. U.S. office and international office properties combined account for roughly 14% of the company\u2019s asset base, and 11% of the company\u2019s assets are invested in residential lending.\n\nStarwood\u2019s owned properties made up 12% of its asset base, and infrastructure lending made up 10% at the end of 1Q-24.\n\nSTWD - IR\n\nSTWD\u2019s commercial lending portfolio is diversified by loan type and region.\n\n92% of its commercial lending portfolio consists of first mortgage loans, 4% consists of commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), 2% consists of mezzanine loans, while subordinated mortgages and preferred equity make up 1% each.\n\nBy region, the company\u2019s portfolio is pretty evenly spread out across the U.S. and 28% of it is international.\n\nIn total, STWD\u2019s loan portfolio has a 15.1 billion carrying value, is 98% floating-rate, and consists of 154 loans with an average loan size of $123.0 million.\n\nSTWD - IR\n\nStarwood\u2019s infrastructure lending segment comprises 43 loans with $2.7 billion in total commitments. 100% of its infrastructure portfolio consists of senior secured securities and 100% of its infrastructure portfolio is floating rate.\n\nPrincipally, all the company\u2019s infrastructure lending is related to the energy sector.\n\nSTWD - IR\n\nThe company\u2019s property segment holds a multifamily and medical office portfolio that total 93 properties with a weighted average occupancy rate of 97%. STWD\u2019s property portfolio contains 15,057 residential units and 2.0 million SF of commercial space.\n\nSTWD - IR\n\nThe company\u2019s investing and servicing segment includes a servicing business that manages problem assets, an investment business that acquires and manages CMBS, and a mortgage loan business that specializes in originating conduit loans for securitization and sale.\n\nSTWD - IR\n\nStarwood Property Trust released its 1Q-24 operating results in May and reported total revenues during the quarter of $523.1 million, compared to total revenues of $490.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDistributable earnings came in at $191.6 million, or $0.59 per share in 1Q-24, compared to distributable earnings of $157.2 million, or $0.49 per share in 1Q-23.\n\nAnalysts expect STWD\u2019s normalized EPS to remain relatively flat over the next several years with EPS estimates of $2.06 per share in 2024, which is expected to increase to $2.08 per share by 2026.\n\nTIKR.com\n\nGoing back to 2011, STWD has had an average adjusted earnings growth rate of 2.80% which is pretty good for a high-yielding mortgage REIT. Analysts currently expect subdued growth with EPS projected to increase by +1% in 2024, fall by -2% in 2025, and then increase by +3% in 2026.\n\nAt its current price, STWD offers a 10.57% earnings yield and a 9.86% dividend yield. Its dividend is well covered, with a 2023 dividend payout ratio of 93.66% and an expected 2024 dividend payout ratio of 92.75%.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a P/E of 9.46x, compared to its normal P/E ratio of 10.00x.\n\nWe rate Starwood Property Trust a Tier 1 Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nLadder Capital Corp (LADR)\n\nLADR is an internally managed mortgage REIT that originates and invests in a portfolio of commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) assets with a specialized focus on senior secured assets.\n\nThe company\u2019s investment activities primarily include:\n\nCore business of originating senior first mortgage loans that are secured by real estate\n\nOwning commercial real estate, primarily net lease properties that generate rental income\n\nInvesting in debt securities secured by first mortgages loans.\n\nSince the company\u2019s beginnings in 2008 it has originated almost $30.0 billion of CRE loans, has acquired roughly $13.0 billion of secured debt securities and approximately $2.0 billion of equity investments in net lease properties.\n\nLADR\u2019s lending operations include both balance sheet lending and conduit lending. Along with its lending operation, the company\u2019s real estate equity investments and its debt security investments provide a diversified base of interest and rental income.\n\nThrough the company\u2019s lending operations, it originates conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized properties that are securitized and sold as commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d).\n\nFrom the company\u2019s inception in 2008 to the end of last year, it originated almost $17.0 billion of conduit loans, the vast majority of which were sold into CMBS securitization. By volume, LADR is the 2nd largest non-bank originator of loans to CMBS securitization in the U.S. between 2008 and 2023.\n\nIn sum, the mortgage REIT has 3 primary streams of income consisting of its loan portfolio, CRE securities portfolio, and its net lease CRE equity portfolio.\n\nLADR - IR\n\nLADR\u2019s senior CRE loan portfolio totals $2.8 billion with an average size loan of roughly $25.0 million, a weighted average extended duration of 1.7 years, and a weighted average LTV of 66%.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of its loan portfolio consists of senior secured first mortgage loans, which make up over 99% of its loan portfolio. In addition to its senior secured loans, the company\u2019s portfolio has less than 1% of conduit mortgage loans and other CRE related investments.\n\nBy property type, the company\u2019s largest category includes multifamily which represents 34% of its portfolio, followed by office at 31% and mixed used at 17%. While office properties represent 31% of its loan portfolio, in relation to its total asset base office properties only account for 16% of the company\u2019s total assets.\n\nLADR - IR\n\nThe company\u2019s net lease equity portfolio totals 5.3 million SF and is made up of 156 properties that are 100% leased with an average lease term of approximately 8.5 years. Additionally, 69% of its net lease portfolio consists of IG-rated net lease tenants.\n\nBy investment type, 68% of its portfolio consists of net lease properties, while the remaining 32% of its properties consists of diversified CRE.\n\nThe company\u2019s net lease portfolio is diversified by property type.\n\nMultifamily properties represent 21% of its net lease portfolio, office represents 20%, dollar stores represent 15%, drug stores represent 12% and grocery stores represent 9%.\n\nLADR - IR\n\nThe company\u2019s CRE securities portfolio totals $467.0 million with a 1.9-year weighted average duration and 99% of its debt securities have an investment-grade (\u201cIG\u201d) credit rating, while 84% of its debt securities are AAA-Rated or Agency-Backed.\n\nLADR\u2019s securities portfolio has an average investment of 5.1 million and currently generates a W.A. unlevered yield of 6.8%.\n\nLADR - IR\n\nSince 2017, the company has had an adjusted operating earnings growth rate of 0.13%. LADR struggle for several years between 2019 and 2021, with negative earnings growth for 3 consecutive years.\n\nThe company bounced back in 2022 with EPS increasing by 137% for the year. Analysts expect EPS to fall by -3% in the current year, but then to increase by +3% and +12% in the years 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nAt its current price, LADR\u2019s stock offers an 11.69% earnings yield and an 8.14% dividend yield, providing plenty of coverage for its dividend. The stock's dividend is well covered, with a 2023 AFFO payout ratio of 68.66% and an expected 2024 AFFO payout ratio of 70.76%.\n\nThe stock is trading at a blended P/E of 8.56x, which compares favorably to its normal P/E ratio of 10.49x.\n\nWe rate Ladder Capital a Tier 1 Buy.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nThe Raised Nail Gets Hammered\n\nOne of my wise friends once said,\n\n\"The raised nail gets hammered.\"\n\nThis certainly applies to high-yield investing.\n\nLong-term REIT investors should be looking for companies with dividends that are not just safe, but also have good growth prospects.\n\nA REIT that yields 10% almost always means that investors perceive very low growth, or potentially a potential dividend cut.\n\nSo folks, always consider the stability and predictability of a REITs operating cash flows, rents, built-in-increases, and real estate operating costs. And importantly, the safety and quality of the dividend.\n\nStay tuned for my next article, Why I Own Rentals And REITs.\n\nHappy REIT Investing!",

        "body": "Adriana Duduleanu\n\nGold (GDX) and copper (COPX) mining stocks outperformed the market in the first five months of the year as metal prices soared. The prices of gold (XAUUSD:CUR) and copper (HG1:COM) hit all-time highs in May on geopolitical tensions, stronger Chinese macroeconomic indicators, and a softer dollar, before retreating amid profit-taking.\n\nGold and Copper Mining Stocks & Commodity Prices vs. S&P 500 (January 1 - May 31)\n\nGold and Copper Stocks Performance - First 5 Months of 2024 (SA Premium)\n\nGold mining stocks have lagged the spot price performance YTD, despite global mining production hitting a new first quarter record at 893 tons (28.576Moz). But gold miners are projected to see a bump in demand from institutions, and cost stabilization could improve performance. Nearly 30% of central banks anticipate adding more gold to reserves in the next 12 months, according to a recent World Gold Council survey, the highest level since the survey began in 2018.\n\nCentral Bank Gold Demand Survey (World Gold Council)\n\nGold mining firms could generate significant free cash flow if the price remains at current levels or goes higher as margins expand, production costs stabilize, and miners see sustainable demand, a Gabelli Gold Fund analyst said. Industry average all-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose 7% YoY to $1,342/oz in Q423. According to S&P Global forecasts, AISC for 11 of the largest gold miners are projected to fall by 2028, \u201cproviding a catalyst for some upside to their future performance.\u201d Major gold producer consolidated cash costs are also expected to drop from now until 2028.\n\nS&P Select Gold Miner Cash Cost Forecast (S&P Global)\n\nCopper miners, meanwhile, stand to gain from the expected long-term boom in demand from electrification. Copper demand is projected to double to 50 million tons/year by 2035 on energy transition requirements, and mining constraints could lead to supply deficits as high as 9.9Mt/year, according to an S&P Global forecast. Citi analysts in a note said only higher prices will solve the copper supply deficit, and predicted the metal is headed for a \u201csecular bull market\u201d on decarbonization-related demand growth.\n\nTop 5 Mining Stocks\n\nMining stocks with solid investment fundamentals and quantitative metrics offer potential upside and afford indirect exposure to commodity prices for investors with an appetite for risk. SA Quant Ratings aim to provide an objective, unemotional, data-driven evaluation of each stock based on over 100 underlying metrics, which are compared to those of sector peers, and graded across five factors: Valuation, Growth, Profitability, Momentum, and EPS Revisions.

Metal prices can fluctuate dramatically based on global macroeconomic and geopolitical drivers outside company control. Commodity prices are highly sensitive to changes in the strength of the dollar, interest rates, global supply balances, Chinese demand, among other factors. Mining projects face several obstacles such as long permitting processes, environmental restrictions, and social opposition. Although supply deficits can push metal prices higher, they also present the risk of demand destruction as consumers search for substitutes and inventors alternative assets.\n\nConcluding Summary\n\nGold and copper mining stocks jumped in the first 5 months of 2024, as commodity prices soared to record highs. Gold miners could get a boost based on growing central bank demand and projected cost stabilization, while copper miners stand to gain from the expected boom in global energy transition requirements. Gold and copper mining stocks offer investors exposure to commodity prices in addition to potential capital appreciation and dividends. We identified five Strong Buy mining stocks, up by ~50% on average in the past year, with strong momentum and earnings growth potential.\n\nIf you're seeking a limited number of monthly ideas from the hundreds of top quant Strong Buy rated stocks, consider exploring Alpha Picks.

Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by software and internet stocks.\n\nNvidia shares have been choppy after losing $430 billion in market value late last week. And, June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteoric rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. accounted for well over half of the 15% advance in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nThe trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&P 500 hit 33% last week, the highest level in about 24 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds\u2019 momentum exposure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Goldman data showed. \u201cLong concentration\u201d and \u201clong crowdedness\u201d have both seen notable declines and are at the lowest levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a potential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.\n\nThe unwind is not just hitting tech alone. Hedge funds are now tilting more defensively than usual. Their gross leverage \u2014 a measure of risk appetite \u2014 has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold regions so far in June.\n\n\u201cAfter adding risk to their portfolio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk unwinds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers,\u201d Goldman wrote in a note.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-sell-tech-stocks-095749442.html",

EPS $1.01 vs $.83 expected. Revenue of $12.6B vs 12.84 expected. Sales miss was attributed due to lifestyle business declining, and traffic in China declining. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Most interesting stock I\u2019m watching today.\n\nINFN- Nokia to acquire INFN in $2.3B deal to scale up their network. Note this news came out at the close yesterday.\n\nCHWY/WOOF- Spiked yesterday during the trading day due to DFV posting a picture of a dog. I wish I was joking.\n\nAMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\n\nWBTN- IPO'd yesterday, watching for any moves upward due to how it traded premarket today.\n\nIPO today: ALMS (immunosuppression therapies)",

        "body": "Automated trading is the process of using computer programs and algorithms to automate trading strategies in the financial markets. Instead of manual execution, traders rely on trading robots that automatically analyze the market, make decisions, and execute trades.\n\nWhat is the advantage of automating analysis?\n\nFirst, it allows traders to react to market events much faster than manual trading. Platforms can instantly analyze and interpret huge amounts of data, which makes rapid decision-making possible.\n\nSecond, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error. Traders can be emotionally stressed, which can lead to irrational decisions. Trading robots work based on predetermined algorithms without the influence of emotion, which increases the discipline of trading and the prospect of an initially working strategy,\n\nTechnical analysis and automated decision making\n\nTrading robots are based on technical analysis, analyzing historical data of prices, volumes and other parameters. They can automatically make decisions to enter and exit trades based on set conditions such as support and resistance levels, indicators and market trends.\n\nAutomated trading software\n\nThere is a variety of automated trading software available. Some platforms offer off-the-shelf solutions, including trading robots and tools to incorporate into their own strategies. Other platforms offer APIs that allow traders to create their own programs based on specified conditions.\n\nFunctionality and features\n\nAutomated trading software can offer a variety of features and functionality. These can include real-time feedback, data visualization, tools to optimize strategies, backtesting and testing capabilities on historical data, and risk and portfolio management.\n\nPros and cons of automated trading\n\nAutomated trading has several advantages. First, it allows traders to greatly increase their speed of reaction to market events, as robots can instantly analyze and make decisions. Second, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error.\n\nHowever, automated trading also has its limitations and risks. Technical glitches, market connectivity issues, and software bugs can lead to lost trades or even financial losses. In addition, trading robots can be sensitive to changes in market conditions and may not always be able to adapt to new situations.\n\nHow to choose the right trading robot or software\n\nConsider your requirements and goals\n\nWhen choosing a trading robot or software, you need to consider your individual requirements and goals. Different robots and platforms may offer different features and strategies, so it is important to determine what you need and what best suits your trading goals.\n\n2. Testing and optimizing strategies\n\nOnce you have chosen your software, it is recommended that you test and optimize your strategies on historical data. This will help you verify the effectiveness of your chosen robot and customize its parameters according to your preferences and trading strategies.\n\nExamples of successful use of automated trading\n\nExample 1: Increasing Profitability with a Trading Robot\n\nOne example of a successful use of automated trading is the case of a trader who was able to significantly increase his profitability through the use of a trading robot. The robot analyzed market data and made decisions about entering and exiting trades based on predetermined algorithms and strategies. This allowed the trader to reduce emotional errors and increase his trading efficiency.\n\nExample 2: Reducing emotional errors and increasing discipline\n\nAnother example of the successful use of automated trading has to do with reducing emotional errors and increasing trader discipline. Trading robots are not subject to emotional stress and do not succumb to panic or greed,",

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "body": "The paradigm shift brought about by artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the face of the technology landscape. If you're looking for evidence of this trend, nowhere is it more apparent than the list of the world's largest companies when measured by market cap.\n\nMicrosoft, at the forefront of AI-powered assistants, boasts a market cap of $3.37 trillion, ahead of the previous champ. Apple, at $3.27 trillion, has dabbled in AI for more than a decade and recently announced sweeping AI updates for many of its devices. Nvidia has been the poster child of AI chipmakers and the third company to sport a market cap of more than $3 trillion. The leaders are followed closely by Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all leaders in generative AI -- with market caps of between $1.31 trillion and $2.29 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of roughly $891 billion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is on track to join this elite group of businesses, probably sooner than later. The adoption of AI continues to gain ground, buoying demand for chips used in the process. As the world's largest semiconductor foundry, TSMC seems destined to join this exclusive fraternity.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA chip off the old block\n\nAfter years of operating in relative obscurity, it appears TSMC's time in the limelight has come. The company describes itself as the \"world's largest and best semiconductor foundry,\" occupying an enviable position in the AI revolution. More specifically, AI processing requires state-of-the-art semiconductors, and TSMC is the chipmaker to the stars. Its biggest customers include Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among many others.\n\nHowever, the trajectory of the business has shifted in recent years. TSMC once relied on smartphone chips for the bulk of its revenue, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes specialized chips used for processing AI, has become the company's biggest moneymaker, recently representing 46% of sales.\n\nTSMC's growth is accelerating. Revenue grew 16.5% year over year to $18.9 billion in the first quarter, while earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 crept 5% higher, as the company boosted research and development (R&D) spending to keep up with evolving technology.\n\nThe company is expecting this growth spurt to continue. Management's outlook is calling for second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, or growth of about 28%. That forecast could end up being conservative. In April and May, the company reported revenue growth of 60% and 30% year over year, respectively, far outpacing management's projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nTSMC occupies a noteworthy space in the AI ecosystem. Since its processors are used by many of the biggest names in the space, TSMC stands to benefit from the accelerating adoption of generative AI -- which has created much of the buzz over the past year or so. Furthermore, its accelerating revenue provides evidence that management is leaning into this opportunity. As such, it should soon vault TSMC into the company of trillionaires.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $85.17 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 10.5. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $95 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nWhat's even more intriguing is that Wall Street is already forecasting revenue growth of 32% and 22% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. If the company clears those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $1 trillion market cap sometime in 2025. However, given the excitement surrounding AI, it could happen even sooner.\n\nThe runway for growth ahead is compelling. During the first-quarter earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI-related revenue] to grow at 50% CAGR [compound annual growth rate] and to increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\"\n\nEstimates regarding the continued proliferation of AI support his conclusions. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next 10 years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. It's worth noting that even the most conservative estimates have been trending higher as new use cases for AI are discovered.\n\nFinally, at 27 times forward earnings, TSMC's valuation is compelling, offering a less-pricey way to invest in the massive opportunity represented by AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

May's reading marked the slowest annual gain in more than three years.\n\nBMO senior economist Jennifer Lee told Yahoo Finance May's inflation reading was \"probably the best one could expect.\"\n\n\"It certainly helps the Fed, [and] gives them a little bit more comfort on their path to starting to ease policy,\" Lee said.\n\nThe report follows other promising May inflation prints. The most recent reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices climbed 0.2% from the prior month, lower than economists' estimates.\n\nBut after surprisingly hot inflation readings to start the year, Federal Reserve officials have remained cautious about inflation's trend, noting in their most recent policy statement it won't be appropriate to cut rates until they have \"greater confidence\" in inflation's path.\n\n\"There has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective,\" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference on June 12. \"We will need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 12: Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves\u2019 William McChesney Martin building on June 12, 2024 in Washington, DC.

        "title": "How Nancy Pelosi's Husband Is Profiting Big-Time on Nvidia -- and Why His Strategy Could Be Smart for You Too",
        "body": "Nancy Pelosi is a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives -- the first woman to serve in that position. She's in her 37th year of representing California's 11th Congressional District. Pelosi is a successful politician, a wife, mother, and grandmother. And some might think she's a savvy investor as well based on her public disclosures of trades.\n\nHowever, a close examination of those disclosures reveals that Rep. Pelosi isn't making the shrewd investing moves. Instead, it's her husband, Paul Pelosi.\n\nMr. Pelosi is profiting big-time from his investment in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's how he's doing things differently -- and why his strategy could be smart for you too.\n\nPaul Pelosi's investing approach\n\nSince early 2023, Mr. Pelosi has invested his money eight times. Two of those transactions involved limited liability companies (LLCs) that weren't traded publicly. The other trades, though, involved public companies.\n\nPelosi invested in Apple and Palo Alto Networks twice each during the period. He invested in Microsoft and Nvidia once each. There are two common denominators with these buys. First, they all focused on technology leaders. Second, Pelosi didn't buy shares of any of these stocks. Instead, he purchased or exercised call options.\n\nCall options give an investor the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares of an underlying stock at a specific price by a specific date. Pelosi's investing approach is to buy call options with strike prices that are deep in the money (i.e., significantly below the share price at the time). He also prefers expiration dates that are well into the future.\n\nHow much has Pelosi made on Nvidia?\n\nOn Nov. 22, 2023, Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia call options with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. At the time, Nvidia's share price hovered around $500 (note that this was before the company's 10-for-1 stock split conducted on June 7, 2024.)\n\nNvidia's share price has skyrocketed nearly 160% since Pelosi bought the 50 call options and is now around $125. If he exercised those calls at the split-adjusted strike price of $12 (reflecting the company's 10-for-1 stock split) and bought 50,000 shares (50 options times 100 shares per option times 10 adjusting for the split), his investment would be worth roughly $6.25 million.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know exactly how much those call options cost Pelosi. However, we do know that had he bought Nvidia shares directly on Nov. 22, 2023, his initial investment would have been in the ballpark of $2.5 million. Since buying deep-in-the-money calls is less expensive than buying shares directly, Pelosi has made more than $3.75 million on his Nvidia trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy it's a smart strategy\n\nWhy is this a smart strategy for Pelosi and potentially a smart one for you? It lowers the risk level of investing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, buying deep-in-the-money call options is less costly than buying shares directly. As a result, you don't have to put as much money at risk. These options increase at roughly the same rate as the underlying stock, so you're well-positioned to profit as much from share price gains as if you'd bought the stock.\n\nYou do have to remember to exercise the options before the expiration date or they'll become worthless. And you can still lose money. The call options decline in value at around the same rate if the underlying stock falls. However, because you don't have as much money invested, the amount you can lose is lower than if you'd bought the stock.\n\nBuying deep-in-the-money call options of Nvidia (or any other stock, for that matter) is more complicated than simply buying the stock. Investors must first obtain approval from their brokerage to trade call options. But for some, the trouble could be worth the effort. Paul and Nancy Pelosi would almost certainly say that it is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Cheap Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 175% and 495%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "The S&P 500 has advanced 15% year to date and 42% since the beginning of 2023. Those gains have made it difficult to find bargains in the stock market, but certain Wall Street analysts see plenty of upside in UiPath (NYSE: PATH) and Block (NYSE: SQ).\n\nKeith Weiss at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case scenario that puts UiPath at $35 per share by May 2025. That forecast implies 175% upside from its current price of $12.69 per share.\n\nMaximilian Friedrich at Ark Invest published a valuation model nearly four years ago that puts Block at $375 per share by December 2025. That forecast implies 495% upside from its current price of $63 per share.\n\nSpoiler alert: Both price targets appear overly ambitious, but UiPath and Block still warrant consideration. Here's what investors should know.\n\n1. UiPath\n\nUiPath is the market leader in robotic process automation (RPA). Its platform helps businesses discover opportunities for automation with process mining and task mining tools. It also helps businesses build and manage software robots to automate those processes and tasks. Additionally, UiPath extends its RPA functionality with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities like computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\nFor example, UiPath's Document Understanding product can extract, interpret, and take action on information from documents. Its Communication Mining product brings the same features to conversational channels like email and chat, which lets businesses automate certain customer interactions. Forrester Research recently recognized UiPath as a leader in document mining and analytics, and the IDC recognized its leadership in intelligent document processing software.\n\nUiPath reported reasonably good financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30). Revenue increased 16% to $335 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 18% to $0.13 per diluted share. But management provided discouraging context that that caused the stock to tumble 35% following the report.\n\nSpecifically, management said deals slowed toward the end of the quarter due to macroeconomic challenges and inconsistent sales execution. Those headwinds are evident in guidance, which calls for revenue growth of just 5% in the second quarter. Founder Daniel Dines has reassumed the role of CEO to steer the company through the challenging period ahead.\n\nOn the bright side, UiPath is the market leader in RPA software, a market projected to grow at 40% annually through 2030. The company is also leaning into demand for generative AI with Autopilot, a conversational assistant that automates various tasks. For instance, Autopilot can streamline the development and testing of automations. Some Autopilot features became generally available in June 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects the company to grow sales at 14% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends January 2028). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 5.3 times sales look quite reasonable. However, shareholders probably won't see triple-digit returns in the next year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's bull-case price target is contingent upon a discounted cash flow model that assumes revenue will grow at 18% annually over the next decade. That is unlikely at this point. However, Morgan Stanley's base-case target of $15 per share still implies that the stock is cheap right now.\n\n2. Block\n\nBlock is a fintech company that breaks its business into the Square and Cash App ecosystems. Square simplifies commerce for merchants with a cohesive set of hardware, software, and banking services. That integrated product strategy differentiates Block from traditional merchant services providers, which generally equip small businesses with disjointed payment processing solutions. Block aims to grow the Square ecosystem by engaging larger sellers and expanding internationally.\n\nSimilarly, Cash App simplifies consumer finance by integrating a broad range of services on a single platform, including the ability to save, spend, borrow, and invest money. Despite competition from PayPal and Venmo, that value proposition is resonating with the market. Cash App was the ninth-most downloaded mobile application in the U.S. last year, and the most downloaded digital wallet. Block is particularly focused on driving direct deposit adoption and boosting cash inflows.\n\nBlock reported solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Square gross profit rose 19% to $820 million and Cash App gross profit rose 25% to $1.2 billion, such that total gross profit increased 22% to $2 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped 98% to $0.85 per diluted share.\n\nBlock made progress expanding the Square ecosystem upmarket and internationally during the quarter. Mid-market sellers, defined as generating $500,000 in annualized gross payment volume (GPV), accounted for 39% of Square GPV, up from 38% in the prior year. International sellers accounted for 13% of Square gross profit, up from 11% in the prior year.\n\nBlock also made progress in driving Cash App inflows. Monthly transacting users increased 6% to 57 million and inflows per monthly transacting user increased 11% to $1,255. Management also noted strong momentum with a variety of products, including Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, BNPL (buy now, pay later), and Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, Block has a reasonably strong economic moat in its ability to simplify commerce and consumer finance, and the company is making progress on its strategic growth initiatives. Block has almost no chance of returning 495% by 2025, but patient investors should still consider buying a small position. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings per share to grow at 40% annually through 2026. That makes its current valuation of 28 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI lost about 0.1%\n\nThe gauges are eyeing an upbeat end to a bumpy week that saw the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq come back from a three-day losing streak. While stocks are set to book a stellar first half as they wrap the last trading day of June, those wobbles have fanned fears of a pullback for the rest of the year.\n\nThe last significant data point of the first six months of the year came in the form of the the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 0.1 % in May from the prior month, in line with Wall Street's expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, with November's US election high on the list of risks, investors took note of President Joe Biden's weak showing in his first debate against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. The former president's promised tax cuts and trade clampdown are seen as likely to boost stocks. Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) jumped in morning trading.\n\nThe market is also on alert for more signs that consumer resilience is losing steam, as key companies flag downbeat prospects for sales. Nike (NKE) stock sank more than 15% in early trading, while Walgreens (WBA) shares remained under pressure on the heels of Thursday's 22% tumble.\n\nLive 4 updates Stocks rise as the Fed's preferred inflation metric shows further cooling US stocks rose on Friday as the latest reading from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation continues to cool, raising the likelihood of a rate cut in the months to come.

Core PCE was up 2.6% over the prior year in May, in line with estimates and unchanged from the annual increase seen in the last two months. May's reading marked the slowest annual gain in more than three years.\n\nTrump Media on the move After a shaky debate performance by President Joe Biden, shares of Trump Media & Technology (DJT) are on the move. As of this writing, shares are up 7.5% in pre-market trading. Be mindful of what you are trading here, folks.

The company's guidance was a real letdown, and concerns linger about its management's execution around product innovation. To not see better guidance from Nike in an Olympic year is a red flag. I liked Stifel analyst Jim Duffy's take on the quarter: \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring 2025 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25. Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty. An investor day in Nov. will likely outline a multi-year economic model with lower returns than the precedent adding risk to the premium enjoyed in the historical multiple. We remain appreciative of N scale advantage in a category with secular growth tailwinds and structural margin potential but, at the current valuation, can\u2019t support a compelling upside case until growth inflection becomes more tangible.\" Duffy downgraded his rating on Nike to hold this morning.",

        "title": "Morning Bid: Parsing Biden TV flop, France poll, PCE time",
        "body": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nIf TV debates decided elections, world markets seem remarkably calm about the prospect of a Donald Trump return to the White House as the first half of the trading year ends on Friday.\n\nIt may be too early to stake bets on November's U.S. election outcome just yet, and there are many pressing issues on the table before then - not least a critical update on Friday on the PCE inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve and the first round of the French assembly election at the weekend.\n\nBut U.S. President Joe Biden's poor performance in Thursday's first of two televised face offs with Trump would appear to put the former President in pole position, with opinion polls before the event showing the two neck and neck.\n\nPerhaps one reason for investor hesitancy was post-debate speculation that Democrats may push Biden to stand aside and see an alternative candidate selected at the party's convention instead.\n\nEither way, U.S. stocks and the dollar were marginally higher early on Friday and Treasury yields steady. The VIX 'fear index' of equity volatility, and related futures on that index covering the election, remain subdued near the lowest levels of the year.\n\nEven currencies potentially most sensitive to Trump's pledges on tariff rises or immigration barriers, like China's yuan or Mexico's peso were undisturbed.\n\nOnce again, the big mover on the currency markets was Japan's yen, which continued to wend its way to new 38-year lows and briefly breached 161 per dollar in the face of continued Japanese government warnings about a repeat of April's intervention to support it.\n\nJapan appointed a new top foreign exchange diplomat as the yen plumbed new lows, heightening expectations of imminent action by Tokyo to shore up the ailing currency. Atsushi Mimura, a financial regulation veteran, replaces Masato Kanda.\n\nFrench bonds markets grew nervier, meantime, ahead of the two-round French elections on Sunday and July 7. The risk premium on French government bonds over German equivalents rose to its widest since the euro zone crisis 12 years ago with polls still suggesting far right parties with the highest percentage vote, though still short of an overall majority in parliament.\n\nThe spread between German and French 10-year yields reached 84 basis points, its widest since September 2012, although nominal 10-year French yields remained below peaks seen late last year.\n\nBack on Wall Street, the economic picture appeared to darken somewhat.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst-time applications for U.S. unemployment benefits drifted lower last week but the number of people on jobless rolls jumped to a 2-1/2 year high in mid-June, suggesting the labor market was cooling amid slowing economic growth.\n\nOther data showed non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, unexpectedly dropping 0.6% last month and the goods trade deficit widened 2.7% to $100.6 billion.\n\nAll of which saw the Atlanta Fed's real-time 'GDPNow' estimate fall to 2.7%, with U.S. economic surprise indexes at their most negative in almost two years.\n\nBetter news is expected from the PCE inflation release for May out later. A 0.1% monthly increase in the core PCE is forecast and that would bring the annual core rate down to 2.6% - its lowest in more than three years.\n\nStill, Fed officials still appear in no rush to loosen interest rates. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that inflation \"appears to be narrowing\" and that should allow one rate cut later this year - less that the 45bp priced into futures markets right now.\n\nMore hawkish Fed governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her stance: \"We are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\"\n\nAnd reflecting the thorny fiscal problems facing whoever wins next year's elections, the International Monetary Fund on Thursday called on the U.S. to raise taxes to curb rising debt levels while applauding \"robust, dynamic\" growth in the world's largest economy.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Nike lunged 12% in out of houses trading on Thursday after it forecast a surprise drop in fiscal 2025 revenue, hurt by faltering demand for its sneakers as consumers covet newer brands such as On and Hoka.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:\n\n* US May personal income and consumption and PCE inflation gauge, Chicago June business survey, University of Michigan final June consumer sentiment survey\n\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin speak\n\n* Iranian Presidential election\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by William Maclean mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. prices were unchanged in May while consumer spending rose moderately, a trend that could draw the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting interest rates this year.\n\nThe flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures(PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain inApril, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysissaid on Friday. In the 12 months through May, the PCE priceindex increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE priceindex unchanged on the month and rising 2.6% year-on-year.\n\nMARKET REACTIONS:\n\nSTOCKS: U.S. stock futures were little changed after the report, up 0.3%BONDS: Benchmark 10-year yields were down three basis points to about 4.27%; Two-year yields fell four points to 4.69%.FOREX: The U.S. dollar extended losses against the yen and was last down 0.2% at 160.53 yen\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, B RILEY WEALTH, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cWhen you compare what we got today with expectations, it is very much in-line and so, the Fed will likely have enough comfort by the time of the September 18th meeting to cut rates for the first time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is notable is that the Fed had pencilled in 2.6% core PCE by the end of 2024, and it looks like we're already there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you looking for a reaction to the data, the key place to look for a reaction to this core PCE at 2.6% clearly is an ongoing downdraft in treasury yields and that's unambiguously good for equities.\"\n\nPETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cPersonal income came in a little bit higher than expected, but spending obviously was lower and that's key for the Fed, indicating lower inflation.\u201d\n\n\"The (price index) numbers were good\u2014in line with expectations. This is good news. It shows that shows that inflation has peaked and is moving in the right direction. The question is \u2018will the feds begin to change their tune on lowering rates?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that they're going to want to see more evidence, but it\u2019s becoming clearer that inflation has peaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get one more month of inflation ticking down, that opens the door for a rate cut in September despite the hardline stance taken by many Fed members.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think inflation going to get down to 2% this year. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Fed cannot cut rates or loosen monetary policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the chances of sending the economy in a recession in the early part of 2025 becomes, increasingly, more of a possibility.\u201d\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAfter basically going nowhere for a year, real disposable personal income finally popped higher. I doubt that signals a change in the trend, though. Spending was nothing to write home about. Even Food service and accommodations had a dip in spending.\n\n\"Slower inflation is helping a bit. Lower inflation doesn\u2019t mean lower prices, it just means they stop rising so quickly. There is deflation in goods prices with the goods price deflator down 0.1% from a year ago. Services inflation came in at 3.9% year-over-year, which is about where it\u2019s been stuck since December. The Fed will see in this data what it wants to see and that\u2019s going to keep everyone guessing as to when the next cut will be.\u201d\n\nJAY WOODS, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, FREEDOM CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK\n\n\"This is a perfect report - it gives the Fed the green light to cut in September, and sets the stage for the dovish rhetoric to continue, which we will hopefully hear in the July meeting. It shows the Fed measures are working and keeps a soft landing still on table. Of course, there's a lot of data between now and September but it hits all the chords for the Fed looking to cut.\n\n\"The S&P 500 is on track to open at an all time high. I'd also watch the Russell 2000 small cap index today, if that rallies strongly that'll be a tell on how the market has taken this.\"\n\nCHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, N.C.\n\n\"This morning's data was almost perfectly in line with consensus. You're not going to learn a lot from the report. The inflation rate is slowing. The last reading that we saw, year over year was 2.7%. It's now come down to 2.6%. So the data is headed in the right direction. The rate of inflation does appear to be slowing so the Fed is going to be happy with this report, but I'm sure they're looking for more they want certainty that we're going to head to the 2% target. Even though we're headed in the right direction, we're not getting there very quickly. Its just decelerating at a much slower pace.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there's enough in this report to get them ready to cut rates. But there's nothing in this report that should keep them concerned. And so that's a difference from earlier this year.\"\n\nThis report doesn't really give us any new information. It's more a status quo. We still think the fed will cut rates once this year and they'll do it in December, more because they want to cut rates than that they need to cut rates.\"\n\n\"If a car is slowing down from 60 miles an hour to 30 miles an hour, when it goes from 60 to 40 you notice it but when it goes from 33 to 31, it's just not very exciting.\"\n\nCAROL SCHLEIF, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BMO FAMILY OFFICE, MINNEAPOLIS\n\n\u201cMarkets will breathe the sigh of relief that the PCE didn\u2019t really surprise one way or the other. It's still indicative of an economy that's coasting, hopefully to a more sustainable long term pace, with inflation still bumping its way downward\u201d\n\n(Compiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team)",

Should I tell them my secret?\n\n\u201cSome people who write to this column compare and despair. You don\u2019t have that problem, so you can worry less about what you may or may not have missed.\u201d - MarketWatch illustration\n\nDear Healthy Boomers,\n\nTen years is a long time to ride out a stock-market bust.\n\nLet\u2019s deal with your worst nightmares first. After the 1929 market crash, when the stock market eventually lost roughly 90% of its value, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA took more than 25 years (Nov. 23, 1954) before it closed above the level at which it closed on that fateful day. But analysts say it actually took five to 10 years, accounting for the deflation.\n\nAmong the many lessons from the Great Depression (and 2008 financial crash) is that one man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s tofu, where one person sees stability, another expects chaos. The Yale economist Irving Fisher famously said stock-market prices reached \u201cwhat looks like a permanently high plateau,\u201d according to this Oct. 16, 1929 report in the New York Times.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, in a bulletin on March 25, 1929, the Federal Reserve warned that \u201cexcessive or too rapid growth in any field of credit, whether it be commerce, industry, agriculture, or the trading in securities, is a matter of concern to the Federal Reserve system. Too rapid expansion of bank credit in any field may result in serious financial disorganization\u2026\u201d\n\nIt took more than five years for the market to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused in part by predatory and subprime lending in the mortgage market and a lack of financial regulation. Diversification is also key to weather such storms: many companies survived the 1929 and 2008 financial crashes and, yes, some did not.\n\nThe complexities of a cash cushion in retirement\n\nYou have no debt and your Social Security will give you an income of $83,000 a year, more than half of your pre-retirement expenses, not accounting for your $2.9 million in retirement accounts and CDs. Plus, you have no mortgage. You\u2019ve worked hard and planned wisely in advance of a comfortable retirement and peace of mind. You can afford both.\n\nSome people who write to this column compare and despair. You don\u2019t have that problem, so you can worry less about what you may or may not have missed. The average retirement income for adults 65 and older last year was $83,085 when adjusted for inflation, according to Retireguide.com. And the median income? That\u2019s $52,575 a year.\n\nFor others reading this, you must also be 62 to claim Social Security spousal benefits or have a child who is either under 16 or already receiving Social Security. The amount also depends on whether the higher-earning spouse started claiming at 62, or waited until their full retirement age. (It sounds like your husband is waiting until he turns 70).\n\nNow that I have congratulated you, which seems appropriate under the circumstances, let\u2019s talk about the $67,000 shortfall, which amounts to 2% of your portfolio, according to Paul Karger, co-founder and managing partner of TwinFocus, a wealth advisory firm. \u201cThis should be easily attainable given current rates and a balanced portfolio approach to stocks and bonds,\u201d he says.\n\nYou have, for the most part, sheltered yourself against a major stock-market downturn, given your current allocation of stocks and cash, and your age and risk profile. \u201cWe would advise using taxable funds to cover any shortfalls in advance of dipping into your retirement accounts, given the tax-advantaged nature of your retirement assets,\u201d Karger says.\n\nHe has one caveat: \u201cWe would suggest beginning to nibble at some longer duration bonds, perhaps Treasurys,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhile short-dated bonds and money-market funds are offering compelling yields, and in many cases, higher yields than longer duration bonds due to the inversion of the yield curve, this may prove to be a shorter-term phenomenon,\u201d Karger adds.\n\nAs most of your wealth is in retirement accounts, which means that distributions will be taxed as they are withdrawn. \u201cThis diminishes the after-tax funds available and necessitates a thoughtful distribution strategy to minimize the amount of taxes paid each year,\u201d says Michele Martin, president at wealth-management company Prosperity in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nIncreasing your amount of fixed-income investments \u2014 your stock and bond allocation \u2014will create a \u201csmoother ride\u201d over time, she says. Martin suggests creating a more diversified allocation to bonds and fixed-income investments. \u201cIf interest rates decline, the return on cash will decline in lock step and that is defined as reinvestment risk,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cDistribution mode is the opposite of dollar-cost averaging,\u201d Martin says. \u201cWhen you take distributions from your portfolio in down markets the impact is magnified. A more conservative portfolio that creates recurring income actually provides a similar return overall to a more aggressive portfolio because it moderates the drawdown in volatile market conditions.\u201d\n\nIn other words, you have mastered the \u201caccumulation\u201d part of your retirement plan, and now it\u2019s time to focus on the \u201cdistribution\u201d strategy. Bottom line: Martin says a high-level asset allocation of 60/40 is adequately diversified given your age, and it may not be necessary to reduce the amount of exposure to stocks if you are comfortable with the variability of investment returns.\n\nHow will the current stock-market \u2018bubble\u2019 end?\n\nAbout that potential stock-market bust. Only stock-market columnists, economists, analysts and psychics should make predictions and I don\u2019t give odds based on any of the aforementioned parties. These predictions compiled by State Street Associates, based on research by Harvard University professor Robin Greenwood, rate such an outcome as low.\n\nMarketWatch columnist Mark Hubert predicts the current stock-market bubble will end with slow deflation rather than a bang. He does not foresee a so-called crash \u2014 defined by some economists as a 40% fall in prices over the next two years. He recently wrote about the \u201chuge return differential\u201d between the cap-weighted S&P 500 SPX and the equal-weight version.\n\n\u201cSo far this year the cap-weighted index (the one quoted in the financial press every day) has outperformed the equal-weight version by more than 10 percentage points,\u201d he adds. \u201cLast year, the cap-weighted version\u2019s outperformance was more than 12 percentage points.\u201d (The equal-weight version gives each company the same weight, regardless of its size.)\n\n\u201cThis difference suggests that the cap-weighted version\u2019s performance has become increasingly reliant on the largest stocks in the index, and many analysts believe such concentration is a sign of an unhealthy market that is especially vulnerable to a decline,\u201d Hubert adds. \u201cBut my analysis of data since 1970 does not support this.\u201d He errs on the side of a whimper rather than a crash.\n\nSo enjoy these halcyon years \u2014 and send us all a postcard.\n\nMore columns from Quentin Fottrell:\n\n\u2018My mother is being catfished\u2019: She fell \u2018madly in love\u2019 with a man over Facebook.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prices were unchanged in May while consumer spending rose moderately, a trend that could draw the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting interest rates this year.\n\nThe flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index unchanged on the month and rising 2.6% year-on-year.\n\nInflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the U.S. central bank since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in April.

        "body": "Adhering to the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum that suggests individual investors hold at least as many stocks as they are years old, I currently have 36 core holdings in my retirement account. While I own many more starter-sized positions of other stocks as well, I focus the majority of my monthly dollar-cost averaging (DCA) buys on these 36 holdings.\n\nSo far in 2024, my worst-performing stocks among these 36 businesses have been fintech SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) and streaming platform Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), which are down between 36% and 38%. As disheartening as these drops are, they are a standard part of being an individual investor -- and I have absolutely no interest in selling right now.\n\nWhy?\n\nI have a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to selling a stock too early, only to watch it become a multibagger over the coming decades. Consider Nvidia when its share price went essentially nowhere for a decade in the early 2000s. Or how bad Amazon looked after the failed launch of its Fire phone. Or how disjointed Netflix looked amid its Qwikster debacle.\n\nAll of these stocks have since become multibaggers following what initially looked like reasonable times to sell. So, instead of selling, I'd much rather pause my DCA additions and leave a struggling stock alone -- seeing what happens over a longer time frame.\n\nWith that said, here's why I'm far from ready to panic over the sell-off so far in 2024 for SoFi and Roku -- and why one of them looks downright interesting at today's prices.\n\n1. SoFi Technologies\n\nShares of diversified fintech SoFi have slid about 35% so far in 2024, despite the company beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines in its most recent quarter. After its revenue rose by 26% in the first quarter of 2024 -- despite its largest unit, lending (personal, student, and home loans), delivering little growth -- SoFi is becoming a well-rounded financial power.\n\nThe company's young financial services segment produced 86% sales growth as people continued to flock to SoFi's Money accounts, which currently offer 4.6% interest rates. These enticing rates brought in another $3 billion in deposits during the quarter, increasing the company's total to more than $21 billion. These deposits are critical to the company's success over the long term, as they provide a stable source (90% comes from recurring direct deposits) of lower-cost funding for its lending segment.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's technology platform segment -- which management wants to build into the \"AWS [Amazon Web Services] of fintech\" -- increased revenue by 21% as the company continued courting large banks in North and South America.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest yet for investors? Despite the market's adverse reaction toward management's cautious outlook for the second quarter, SoFi's net profit margin continues to trend higher (outside of a one-time event in 2023).\n\nSOFI Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith its management forecasting earnings-per-share to grow to between $0.55 and $0.80 by 2026, SoFi's current share price of around $6.50 could prove to be a deep discount. Furthermore, Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto continues to buy shares of the company's stock. Considering SoFi's growth potential, early profitability, and robust liquidity from its growing deposit base, I'll happily keep buying shares alongside Noto.\n\nImage source: Roku.\n\n2. Roku\n\nStreaming platform leader Roku's share price has continued its sharp decline ever since being deemed one of the \"pandemic darlings\" in 2020 and 2021. It's down 38% so far in 2024. Now 88% below its all-time highs, Roku trades with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of only 2.2, which is near its lowest-ever mark at 1.7.\n\nNaturally, this steep drop in price and valuation makes the company a rather interesting turnaround story. After its streaming households count rose by 14% to 84 million and its streaming hours by 23% to 31 billion in the first quarter of 2024, there is a strong argument that Roku is worth buying today.\n\nFurthermore, the company's Roku Channel has now grown to become the third-largest streaming app on its platform, helping to draw roughly 120 million viewers to the Roku home screen every day.\n\nAfter partnering with The Trade Desk and its industry-leading connected TV (CTV) advertising prowess, Roku is poised to improve its monetization from the 84 million households it reaches. By pairing The Trade Desk's advertising solutions and deep client roster with Roku's treasure trove of customer data, the partnership should allow advertisers to deliver more targeted marketing campaigns, maximizing their ad spend.\n\nWith streaming services now capturing 60% of total hours viewed versus linear TV but only receiving 30% of total ad spending, there is a long growth runway remaining for this partnership to continue paying dividends.\n\nAs great as all of these factors are, however, I am not ready to go all-in on Roku at today's potentially discounted price. While free cash flow (FCF) has improved dramatically over the last year following Chief Financial Officer Dan Jedda's arrival from Amazon and later Stitch Fix, the company's stock-based compensation (SBC) remains a concern for me.\n\nConsider the following chart.\n\nROKU Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nOnce we subtract Roku's SBC from its FCF, we see that it only has an adjusted 1.6% FCF margin over the last year. While this is an improvement from 2022's negative FCF, I would rather be patient with Roku and see if its cash generation and profitability can continue to improve.\n\nHowever, thanks to the ongoing shift in ad spend toward CTV working in Roku's favor, the company's deal with The Trade Desk, and its industry-leading reach, I wouldn't dream of selling my position yet, either. With Roku already a healthy 2% position in my retirement account, I'm perfectly happy to be patient -- and give the long-term megatrends working in the company's favor time to play out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoFi Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoFi Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "I Want to Give Money to My Son and His Wife. How Much Can I Give Without Triggering Taxes?",
        "body": "Let's say that you're an individual who wants to give money to two people, your son and his wife. Maybe this is to help with a wedding, down payment for a home or building a family.\n\nYou can likely give away a good amount of money without incurring any taxes, but there may be some other hoops to jump through. In 2024, you can give away up to $18,000 to each recipient without needing to report it to the IRS. Then, you can give away another $13.61 million total tax-free throughout your lifetime, although you will need to report such transfers. In 2024, you could theoretically give your son and daughter-in-law up to a combined $13,646,000 tax free. If you\u2019re married, you can likely give even more. It's a little more complicated than that though, so read on to learn just how the gift tax works.\n\nConsider consulting a financial advisor who can help you build a strategy to most effectively give gifts to family.\n\nWhat Is the Gift Tax?\n\nThe gift tax is a hybrid tax on gifts and other transfers. It partially overlaps with the estate tax, which is where the \"hybrid\" part comes in.\n\nThe IRS defines a gift as \"the transfer of property by one individual to another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.\" Basically, you trigger this tax when you give someone property or assets without receiving equivalent value in return. Equivalent value (or \"full value\") is a reasonability test. You don't have to prove your transaction to a market certainty, just that a reasonable person could see this as a fair trade.\n\nThe gift tax only applies to exchanges of ownership. Personal services don't apply, nor does letting someone borrow or access your property. For example, say you're a CPA. Doing your friend's taxes is not a transfer, nor is letting them stay at your beach house for a week, even though both have market value. You must give them ownership of actual assets.\n\nThe gift tax is most often triggered by three situations:\n\nUnilateral transfers, in which you give assets while receiving nothing in return.\n\nLow-value transfers, in which you give assets while receiving less than full value in return.\n\nLow- or no-interest loans, in which you give a loan and charge significantly less than market interest.\n\nLawyers use the 19th century example of a \"peppercorn promise\" to illustrate low-value transfers. Say your friend offers to sell you their car in exchange for a peppercorn. This would be a gift dressed up as a sale because, even though you are technically exchanging assets, the value of the car dramatically exceeds 1/16 teaspoon of spices. The taxable value of this gift would be the difference in value between the car and the peppercorn.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, the IRS exempts several categories of transfers from the gift tax. For example, direct tuition and medical payments typically do not count as taxable gifts regardless of the amount.\n\nFor help navigating the complications of gift tax laws, consider consulting with a fiduciary financial advisor.\n\nGift Tax Exclusions and Rates\n\nLike the estate tax, few households will ever pay the gift tax. This is due to high annual and lifetime exclusions, which are amounts that you can give away without triggering gift taxes.\n\nAnnual Exclusions\n\nThe annual exclusion is the amount you can give away each year without reporting it to the IRS. The annual exclusion operates on a per-donor, per-recipient basis. This means that you can give away up to the annual exclusion to an unlimited number of people each year without reporting it. In 2024, the annual exclusion is $18,000, and the IRS generally adjusts it each year for inflation.\n\nThe annual exclusion renews each year, meaning that the amount you can give tax-free in a given year has no relationship with gifts you have made in previous years.\n\nFor example, in 2024, you could give $18,000 to your son and another $18,000 to your daughter-in-law without reporting these transfers to the IRS or paying taxes. Then, in 2025, you can do so again.\n\nThe annual exclusion has no relationship with the estate tax.\n\nLifetime Exclusions\n\nOnce you exceed the annual exclusion to a given recipient, you must report any additional gifts to the IRS using Form 709. This form is filed with your annual taxes, not at the time you make the gift.\n\nGifts in excess of the annual exclusion apply to your lifetime exclusion. This is the amount that you can transfer tax-free over your entire life, in both gifts and estate. It applies cumulatively to you, personally, regardless of recipients. In 2024 the lifetime exclusion is $13.61 million.\n\nThe lifetime exclusion does not renew annually. While the IRS does raise the cap each year to account for inflation, each transfer you make reduces your lifetime exclusion permanently.\n\nFor example, say that you give $22,000 to your son and $25,000 to his wife. Together, this is a combined $11,000 in gifts above the annual exclusions ($4,000 to your son and $7,000 to your wife). You would report that $11,000 in gifts on Form 709 to the IRS and your lifetime exclusion would be reduced by $11,000, potentially from $13.61 million to $13,599,00. That reduction will not go away, even if the IRS raises the exclusion for inflation.\n\nThe lifetime exclusion is a shared exclusion for gifts and estates. During your lifetime, you can make any amount of gifts tax-free to the amount you have remaining in your lifetime exclusion. Then, in your estate, you can pass assets to your heirs tax-free again to the amount you have remaining in your lifetime exclusion.\n\nGift Tax Rates Above the Exclusion Amounts\n\nIf you make a gift that exceeds both your annual exclusion to that individual and your remaining lifetime exclusion, you will owe taxes on the remainder. Gifts and estates are taxed at between 18% and 40% depending on the amount in question.\n\nFor example, say that in 2024 you have $110,000 left on your lifetime exclusion. This means that, over the course of your life, you have given away $13.5 million above each year's annual exclusion to various individuals and organizations. You now want to give $100,000 each to your son and daughter in law. Your taxes would work like this:\n\nSon Annual Exclusion: $100,000 \u2013 $18,000 = $82,000\n\nDaughter-in-law Annual Exclusion: $100,000 \u2013 $18,000 = $82,000\n\n2024 Reportable Gifts: $82,000 * 2 = $164,000\n\nLifetime Exclusion: $110,000 \u2013 $164,000 = -$54,000\n\nTaxable Gift: $54,000\n\nYou do not report gifts up to the annual exclusion for each recipient ($18,000 in 2024). Then you can reduce any reportable gifts by the amount left in your lifetime exclusion. Since your reportable gift exceeds your lifetime exclusion, you will owe taxes on the remaining $54,000.\n\nOnly the giver must report and pay the gift tax. Gifts are generally not considered taxable income, and the recipient does not have to pay gift taxes.\n\nA financial advisor can help you build an appropriate gifting and estate plan. Talk to a financial advisor today.\n\nHow Much Can You Give Away?\n\nSo, all of this said, how much can you give away to your son and his wife? The answer depends in part on how much giving you've made during your life to this point. If you have made past gifts above your annual exclusion for a recipient, then your lifetime exclusion will be reduced by that amount. However, assuming that you still have your full lifetime exclusion, the most you can give your son and daughter-in-law tax free, assuming you are single, is:\n\nSon Annual Exclusion: $18,000\n\nDaughter-in-law Annual Exclusion: $18,000\n\nLifetime Exclusion: $13.61 million\n\nTotal 2024 Giving: $13,646,000\n\nYou can give them the total value of your annual exclusion per person, plus the total lifetime exclusion, for a total tax-free gift of $13,646,000. Although note that, if you do so, you will use up your entire lifetime exclusion. Future transfers through gifts and your estate may be taxed.\n\nDouble Your Gift With Gift Splitting\n\nFinally, there is gift-splitting. This refers to the fact that each member of a married couple receives their own annual and lifetime exclusions, even if they file taxes jointly. So, say that you're married. You can give your son and his wife up to $18,000 each in 2024 under the annual exclusion. Your spouse could also give your son and his wife up to $18,000 each under her own annual exclusion, for a combined gift of $72,000 from one household to the other.\n\nIf you gift-split you must file form 709. This lets you tell the IRS how you have distributed the gift among the members of your household. For example, say that you give your son $30,000. You would need to file a form 709 so that you and your spouse can each claim $15,000 toward your annual exclusion.\n\nGift-splitting also applies to lifetime exclusions. If you are married, in 2024, your household has $13.61 million per spouse to transfer tax-free for combined maximum giving of $27.22 million. Once you exceed your annual exclusion, you can then distribute gifts between your and your spouse's lifetime exclusions. So, if you are married and would like to give money to your son and his wife, you could theoretically give them up to $27,292,000 in 2024 tax-free.\n\nGift splitting can get complicated. Consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you navigate the rules.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGift taxes apply to any unilateral transfer or any exchange when you give assets for less than their full value. Each year the IRS allows you to give an amount tax-free to any number of recipients, and over your lifetime you can give away more than $13 million without paying any taxes on it either.\n\nMore Resources\n\nThe gifts and estate tax is a hybrid tax on unilateral transfers, as we discussed above. However, just like the gift tax, the estate tax has its own rules that only apply to post-mortem transfers. Here's what you need to know.\n\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn\u2019t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Alessandro Biascioli\n\nThe post I Want to Give Money to My Son and His Wife.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in June",
        "body": "Growth stocks haven't received the same love from investors recently that they did during the early days of the pandemic. As the bull market has roared to life, some stocks have responded in a similar fashion while others are still trailing the market.\n\nUltimately, stock price is not the main factor that should determine whether or not you decide to invest in a business. While price is obviously part of the picture, you need to understand the business behind that stock, its financials, its moat, and long-term growth story.\n\nIf you have the risk appetite to invest in growth-oriented businesses, there are plenty of great choices ripe for the picking. Here are two such stocks to consider adding to your buy basket right now.\n\n1. Innovative Industrial Properties\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR) is something of a unicorn in the cannabis space in the sense that it's not technically in the business of growing or selling the actual product. The company operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), and utilizes a sale-leaseback model. It purchases regulated cannabis facilities from licensed operators across the country, then leases them back to those operators under long-term, triple net lease arrangements. Innovative Industrial Properties currently has 108 properties in 19 states in its portfolio.\n\nThis REIT only operates in the medical cannabis industry, a far more widely legalized and regulated market compared to the recreational one. Its structure accomplishes multiple goals. With the triple net lease arrangement, the cannabis operator and not the REIT pays rent and utilities, along with other aspects of keeping up the property such as insurance and maintenance. As of the recent quarter, the average term of Innovative's leases is 14.8 years, with 95.2% of its portfolio leased.\n\nNo tenant represents more than 17% of its annualized base rent, and multi-state operators account for approximately 90% of annualized based rent for the business. If you're wondering why a cannabis operator would commit to a sale-leaseback model, the answer is simple. This is a common arrangement in the cannabis space, primarily because it enables the operator to use more capital to run the actual business. And, because cannabis use is still prohibited by federal law for either medical or recreational purposes, most banks and other financial institutions are extremely hesitant to lend credit to cannabis operators.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Innovative Industrial Properties generated total revenue of around $76 million, while net income totaled $39 million. Those figures were down slightly from one year ago, but investors shouldn't worry. The company took on some costs for property management fees it had to pay for properties it took back possession of, as well as costs associated with reclassifying leases on two properties.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted funds from operations, which are a more accurate metric to gauge a REIT's profitability, came in at $63 million, just a hair down from one year ago, but up 17% from two years ago. Management is being prudent in a tough operating landscape, and the business as well as its financials look solid.\n\nMoreover, Innovative Industrial Properties has a debt ratio of just 11%, an exceptional figure for a capital-intensive business. As a REIT, it is required to pay out around 90% of its earnings in the form of dividends. The company has been consistently profitable, in addition to executing notable top-line growth, so dividend payouts have risen significantly through the years. Over the trailing-five-year period alone, Innovative Industrial Properties has grown its dividend by more than 200%.\n\nThat yield is currently just shy of 7%, an impressive figure by any measure and about 4 times higher than what the average stock trading on the S&P 500 pays. If you have the risk appetite to invest in cannabis stocks, this is one that pays a dividend, is profitable, and has a rock-solid balance sheet overall. Its resilient revenue model is driving growth forward even in an uncertain environment, and as legalization expands the opportunity for the company is considerable.\n\nInvestors might find it worthwhile to scoop up at least a few shares.\n\n2. Shopify\n\nShopify (NYSE: SHOP) is trading down double-digits from the beginning of this year, and is almost touching its 52-week low. While investors seem to be nonplussed about the company's near-term growth prospects -- management is guiding for year-over-year revenue growth in the high-teens in the second quarter -- there's a lot to like about this business if you're looking at a long-term investment horizon.\n\nThe company made waves last year when it decided to sell its logistics business. It's still in the process of divesting this part of its operations, and that is expected to impact revenue by 300 to 400 basis points in the upcoming quarter. So, investors will need to be patient through this readjustment period. Certainly, Shopify isn't delivering pandemic-era growth figures, but expecting that long-term wasn't reasonable. You're looking at a much more mature business than four to five years ago, too.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Shopify processed $61 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV), a 23% increase from the same quarter in 2023, with gross payment volume totaling $36 billion. Revenue rose 23% year over year to just shy of $2 billion, $1.4 billion of which came from merchant solutions revenue with $511 million being derived from subscription solutions revenue. Merchant solutions revenue includes sources like payment processing fees and point-of-sales hardware, while subscription solutions are the recurring fees merchants pay to use the platform.\n\nThat merchant solutions revenue figure was up 20% year over year, while subscription solutions rose 34%. The company was free-cash-flow-positive, bringing in $232 million in the three-month period. It ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments, and it's raked in operating cash flow of $1.1 billion over the trailing 12 months.\n\nShopify Payments has now penetrated 60% of the company's GMV, which means more and more merchants are choosing this seamless payment processing solution for their store rather than a third-party offering. Its checkout service, Shop Pay, processed 56% more GMV in the first quarter of 2024 than it did in the year-ago period, accounting for 39% of overall GMV.\n\nManagement is also actively working to integrate artificial intelligence into its suite of offerings for merchants. For example, its AI assistant, Shopify Magic, helps merchants write, edit, and create content for email campaigns, product descriptions, and other key aspects of marketing to customers.\n\nIn this writer's humble opinion, it seems shortsighted to suppose Shopify's day in the Sun is over. Investors who agree might want to consider an investment in this stock sooner than later while it's trading on sale.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Innovative Industrial Properties right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Innovative Industrial Properties, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Innovative Industrial Properties wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "For more than a half-century, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a clinic for Wall Street. Based on annualized total returns (including dividends) since the mid-1960s, the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has practically doubled up the benchmark S&P 500 (19.8% vs. 10.2%, as of Dec. 31, 2023).\n\nOn an aggregate total return basis, this outperformance is even more pronounced -- a roughly 36,000% total return for the S&P 500 versus a nearly 5,000,000% return for Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on June 26, 2024.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's ability to run circles around Wall Street's widely followed stock indexes is the result of a laundry list of factors that include:\n\nA desire to buy into businesses that have well-defined competitive advantages.\n\nFocusing on companies that have strong, time-tested management teams.\n\nPacking Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio with cyclical stocks that'll benefit from disproportionately long periods of economic growth.\n\nConcentrating Berkshire's 44-stock, $387 billion investment portfolio into a handful of Buffett's and his team's best ideas.\n\nHaving plenty of cash on hand to take advantage of Wall Street's inevitable swoons.\n\nBut perhaps the most-defining characteristic of Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is his desire to own great businesses over the long term. Whereas the average stock holding period is less than a year, the Oracle of Omaha and his top investing aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are looking to hold what they deem to be wonderful businesses \"indefinitely.\n\nThough you'll find plenty of holdings in Berkshire's 44-stock portfolio that have been fixtures for years, only three stocks have been continuously owned since 2000.\n\nCoca-Cola: Continuously held since 1988\n\nWhen it comes to tenure in Berkshire Hathaway's closely watched $387 billion investment portfolio, beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) reigns supreme. Buffett's company has been continuously holding shares of Coca-Cola since 1988 -- and with on a cost basis of $3.2475 per share is generating a dividend yield on cost of nearly 60% each year.\n\nThe great thing about consumer staples stocks like Coca-Cola is that they provide a basic necessity good or service. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy and/or stock market are performing, consumers still need beverages. This leads to consistent and predictable operating cash flow year after year.\n\nOn a more company-specific basis, Coca-Cola has operations in every country, save for North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter has to do with its invasion of Ukraine). This virtually unparalleled geographic diversity allows the company to reap the rewards of steady operating cash flow in developed countries, while enjoying needle-moving organic growth in emerging markets. Altogether, Coke has more than two dozen brands globally that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nBranding and marketing are additional reasons Coca-Cola has been a phenomenal long-term investment. Kantar's annual \"Brand Footprint\" report notes that Coca-Cola has been the world's most-chosen brand off retail shelves by consumers for 12 consecutive years. The company's marketing team has been leaning on digital channels to engage its younger consumers, and can still rely on its rich history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature audience.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway collecting $776 million in annual dividend income from its stake in Coca-Cola, there's absolutely no incentive to sell this position.\n\nImage source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: Continuously held since 1991\n\nA second stock that's been a fixture in Warren Buffett's investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway for more than three decades is credit-services juggernaut American Express (NYSE: AXP). \"AmEx,\" as it's better known, has been a steady holding since 1991.\n\nAmEx is the embodiment of the prototypical Buffett investment. It's a financial stock (Buffett's favorite sector) with a well-known brand, rock-solid management team, and is cyclical.\n\nEven though the Oracle of Omaha and Berkshire's brightest investment minds know U.S. recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they realize that downturns are short-lived. Nine of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II were resolved in under 12 months. Buffett loves buying brand-name businesses like AmEx and allowing them to thrive during extended periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe not-so-subtle secret to American Express's success is that it's able to benefit from both sides of the transaction aisle. It's the clear No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., which allows it generate predictable fee revenue from merchants. At the same time, it's also a lender (via credit cards), which helps the company generate annual fees and net-interest income from its collective cardholders. When the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders, this ability to double-dip comes in handy.\n\nFurthermore, AmEx has historically done a magnificent job of attracting higher income individuals as cardholders. High earners are less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills during minor economic disruptions.\n\nFinally, Berkshire Hathaway's annual yield on cost for its stake in American Express (based on an $8.49 per share cost basis) is a jaw-dropping 33%! In other words, Berkshire is practically doubling its initial investment in AmEx based on dividend income alone every three years.\n\nMoody's: Continuously held since its public debut on Sept. 30, 2000\n\nThe third company billionaire Warren Buffett has continuously owned since 2000 is credit-rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO). Berkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder since Dun & Bradstreet spun off Moody's in September 2000.\n\nMoody's long-term outperformance is a reflection of at least one of its two core operating segments firing on all cylinders at any given time.\n\nMoody's is best-known for its Investors Service segment, which provides credit ratings for corporate and governmental debt. More than a decade of historically low lending rates spurred businesses and governmental agencies to issue debt. This kept the fuel burning for Moody's front-and-center operating segment.\n\nBut beginning in March 2022, the Federal Reserve undertook its most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades. With interest rates climbing, the desire to raise capital via debt issuance became less appealing. As demand to rate corporate debt has slowed, growth potential has shifted to Moody's Analytics.\n\nThe company's analytics segment provides various risk management, economic assessment, and compliance solutions to its customers. In an environment where a couple of predictive tools suggest a U.S. recession is forthcoming -- e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply -- risk-management tools are a hot commodity.\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but Berkshire Hathaway is raking in the dividend income with Moody's, as well. Even though new investors in Moody's stock would generate just a 0.8% yield, Berkshire's cost basis of approximately $10.05 per share produces a yield on cost of about 34%! Being able to triple Berkshire's initial investment in Moody's every third year means there's zero incentive for Warren Buffett to ditch this position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "body": "Want to beat Warren Buffett at his own game? Right now, there are two stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio trading below Buffett's original purchase price.\n\nIf you believe in the Oracle of Omaha, these two stocks should top your buy list.\n\nA rare high-tech bargain\n\nFor decades, Buffett avoided investing heavily into tech. That has changed dramatically in recent years. Berkshire's biggest position, after all, is currently Apple -- a stake worth roughly $135 billion.\n\nWhat changed? A big contributor is that Buffett now shares control with a few trusted lieutenants, including Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Combs or Weschler was reportedly behind Berkshire's Apple stake -- one of the firm's most profitable positions in recent memory.\n\nIt seems likely that either Combs or Weschler -- or perhaps someone else entirely -- is responsible for Berkshire's current position in Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), a cloud computing company based in Bozeman, Montana. According to filings, Berkshire first purchased shares in the second half of 2020. Back then, the stock price was around $240. Today, it's around $130. It's a relatively small position for Berkshire, valued at around $1 billion, but this looks like a great opportunity to buy one of its positions at a steep discount.\n\nSnowflake was once a market darling, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 150. Today, shares trade at just 14 times sales. The issue has been slowing sales growth. \"The company's revenue growth was explosive in 2020 but has dramatically slowed,\" explains Fool contributor Justin Pope. \"Revenue grew 'just' 32% year over year in the most recent quarter.\"\n\nStill, the company is currently free cash flow positive. It's adding more and more customers to its growing tech portfolio, and its net revenue retention rate is around 130%, meaning its customers are willing to pay more for its services. After the pullback, this looks like a great way to mimic Berkshire's investment at a rare discount.\n\nSNOW PS Ratio Chart\n\nBuffett still believes in this troubled value stock\n\nWhen it comes to Buffett's stock picks, few have turned out worse than Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC). Buffett purchased H.J. Heinz in 2013, guiding it to a merger with Kraft Foods several years later. According to filings, he owned shares in the combined company since 2015, when shares traded for roughly $75 apiece. Today, they trade hands at just $32.\n\nWhat went wrong? Consumer spending trends have shifted heavily toward non-traditional brands, including an onslaught of new competition. Inflation, meanwhile, has limited growth and profitability. These pressures remain, but it's hard to deny the stock's cheap valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the next five years, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow earnings by around 4% per year. That's a paltry growth rate, but the stock's valuation reflects that. Right now, Kraft Heinz shares trade at just 14 times earnings with a dividend yield of around 5%. The S&P 500, for comparison, trades at 28 times earnings -- a 100% premium.\n\nThe cheap valuation and hefty dividend could be enough to attract many potential investors. But it's the underlying brand portfolio that should get you most excited. Kraft Heinz owns an enviable collection of well-known brands, including Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Meyer, Philadelphia, Ore-Ida, Cool Whip, Capri Sun, Jell-O, Velveeta, and many, many more. Buffett has always been a big believer in the power of brands, which explains why he's retained a $12 billion position in the company -- roughly one-quarter of the total outstanding shares.\n\nCompared to Snowflake, Kraft Heinz is a classic Buffett bet. It's a profitable, iconic company with durable brand power and a cheap valuation. Don't expect massive gains, but Kraft Heinz looks promising for any investor looking for bargain Buffett stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Snowflake wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Tracking electric vehicle (EV) registrations can be helpful to investors, as some automakers don't release monthly sales and some also don't break out sales per electric vehicle. It's a good way to keep an eye on the industry trends, and while the data is delayed a few weeks, April's data had some interesting movers, including Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN).\n\nWhat's going on\n\nU.S. EV registrations rose 14% in April, which was a nice turnaround from the slow growth witnessed during the first quarter. The increase was largely driven by more incentives from automakers trying to push excess EV inventory off the lots.\n\nThe top 10 EVs by registrations had some major moves, though Tesla continued to easily take first and second place with its Model Y and Model 3, respectively. Despite dominating the market, Tesla's registrations were actually down 17% in April, compared to the prior year, and its market share dropped to 46.3% from 63.8%, according to S&P Global Mobility.\n\nSome of the biggest gainers were Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F) Mustang Mach-e with a 287% gain, compared to the prior year; Toyota's bZ4X with a staggering 647% gain; and Rivian's R1S with a welcomed 126.8% gain.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Tesla's Cybertruck appeared 8th on the list despite not having any comparable gains from the prior year's April. One reason behind Toyota's bZ4X gains is that the company's April incentives checked in at a staggering $10,963, compared to the prior year's $718. Toyota wasn't the only one pushing big deals to move inventory. Ford upped its incentives to roughly $9,000 on its Mustang Mach-e compared to the prior year's $877.\n\nFor Rivian, the uptick in R1S registrations is a good sign, as its R1T failed to appear on the top 10 list. Furthermore, management has noted that the R1S is currently the more profitable of the two vehicles. In a little bit of bad news, while the R1T didn't make the cut, its competition, the Ford F-150 Lightning, posted a 95.7% gain. It checked in at 7th, just ahead of the Cybertruck and just behind the R1S.\n\nIn terms of brands by market share of EV registrations, Tesla was in the top spot at 46.3%, and Ford was in second place at 8.1%. Hyundai Kia and BMW round out the top five with 5.5%, 4.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. Rivian just missed the top five with a 4.1% gain.\n\nDown the road\n\nRivian could also see a potential uptick when the summer data is released. That's largely because early in June, the company announced the introduction of its second-generation R1S and R1T. The vehicles were refreshed with hundreds of hardware improvements, performance upgrades, a redesigned software experience, and in-house drive systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe EV maker also introduced two entirely new premium Ascend trims, and premium trims are generally associated with better margins -- something very important to Rivian in 2024 as it aims to become gross profit positive in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, the spike in R1S registrations is just a little good news as investors hope the R1 vehicles' refresh helps stir up demand while they wait for the R2 launch in 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock looks almost unstoppable. The company's sales and profits have been soaring, and demand for its chips continues to skyrocket as tech companies look to develop artificial intelligence (AI) models. This year, its market cap topped $3 trillion, landing it a spot among the three most valuable companies in the world.\n\nBut all that success could come at a cost. Nvidia has become so dominant and important in its part of the AI space that it has drawn the attention of antitrust regulators.\n\nAntitrust investigations focus on powerful influence in AI\n\nAccording to a New York Times article, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are proceeding with antitrust investigations into three significant players in the AI industry: Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThere's no denying how successful Nvidia has become as a result of the emergence of generative AI. ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, and since then, Nvidia's share price has risen by around 600%. As the leading provider of the high-end processors necessary to train and power AI models, most companies that want to develop such software are going through Nvidia. And as the Times report notes, one issue is that Nvidia's AI software platform \"locks customers into using its chips.\"\n\nIn the case of OpenAI, the company's generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, has become hugely successful, and even former employees believe that there needs to be more oversight of such systems given how quickly the AI industry has been growing. Microsoft is also a major player in the industry, and has purchased a 49% stake in OpenAI.\n\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia?\n\nIf the antitrust investigation of Nvidia leads to charges, there are many possible outcomes. Those could be as minimal as regulators fining the company, or as serious as ruling that it must restructure its operations, and possibly divest itself of certain business units.\n\nFinancially, the company is in an excellent position to weather any fines it might face: Nvidia has generated more than $39 billion in free cash flow over its last four reported quarters, and during that time, its profits have totaled nearly $43 billion.\n\nIt's difficult to predict the outcome when it comes to any legal case. Given the significance of AI and how quickly these three companies become the major players in the industry, I'm inclined to think that if the Justice Department's investigation concludes Nvidia violated antitrust laws, the consequences could be more significant than simple fines or penalties. But I also don't think they would be something as drastic as a breakup of the tech company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAntitrust cases can take years to play out, which can be both good and bad news for investors -- good in the sense that they may not directly impact the business under scrutiny right away, but bad because they cast a cloud over the target that doesn't lift until the matter is resolved.\n\nIs Nvidia too risky to buy right now?\n\nAlthough antitrust cases can be concerning, investors shouldn't worry too much about these developments. Besides, predicting with any accuracy what regulators and the courts will do in these situations is next to impossible.\n\nFor now, long-term investors should stay the course. This news isn't a reason to sell your shares of Nvidia since, effectively, nothing has happened yet.\n\nIf, however, you are risk-averse and are worried about the long-term risk this poses for the GPU giant, it may be a good idea to consider investing in other AI stocks, especially given that Nvidia's valuation is effectively priced for perfection. When a stock carries such a high price tag, any hint of bad news can lead to a sell-off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Ask an Advisor: My 401(k) Is Down 30% and I'm 5 Years Away From RMDs. Should I Stay Aggressive to Regain My Losses or Rebalance?",
        "body": "Financial advisor and columnist Brandon Renfro\n\nWhen I retired in September 2022, my 401(k) was invested aggressively (90/10 split between stocks to bonds) and lost approximately 30%. I left the 401(k) invested in mutual funds in hopes it would gain back some of the losses. A year later it has gained back approximately 20%. I\u2019m not required to take RMDs for another five years. My question is should I transfer the 401(k) funds to my traditional IRA account, which is invested 100% in equities and let an advisor manage the account? Or should I leave it in the mutual funds and rebalance the stock/bond percentage to be less aggressive, say 80/20 or 70/30?\n\n\u2013 Bev\n\nCongratulations on your recent retirement and being in what sounds like a stable financial position. Your question is a simple but somewhat loaded one. The answer depends a lot on what you want and need from your retirement account and what you would want from an advisor. Instead of focusing on returns, I would encourage you to think about how your investments fit within a broader context of your goals, attitudes and lifestyle preferences. (And if you need help making important retirement decisions, consider working with a financial advisor.)\n\nAssessing Your Situation\n\nA newly retired woman looks out the window as she thinks about her plans for retirement.\n\nThe reason I say it sounds like you may be in a good financial position is the implication that you aren\u2019t withdrawing from your account. I take that to mean you have enough other income or savings to get you through until required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin. If so, that\u2019s great that you\u2019re able to do that.\n\nThat being said, let\u2019s talk about your asset allocation \u2013 the mix of different investments you hold. On one hand, for a retiree to have 90% of their investments in stocks is incredibly aggressive. For the vast majority of retirees, that would be too aggressive. Ordinarily, that money needs to be much more stable so you can take regular withdrawals from it. Since you implied that you won\u2019t begin withdrawals for another five years, this may not be the case for you.\n\nYour investment horizon may be much longer, and you may not need the money you\u2019re required to withdraw once you hit RMD age. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s possible that you have the capacity to invest aggressively in stocks, although I can\u2019t say for certain based on the information you shared. (And if you need help selecting an appropriate asset allocation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.)\n\nConsider Your Risk Tolerance\n\nOf course, your attitude toward risk comes into play, too. You made the right choice by waiting it out rather than panic-selling after your account dropped in value. This suggests you may have a high enough risk tolerance to stomach an aggressive asset allocation. However, consider how stressed you were, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut your asset allocation and risk tolerance shouldn\u2019t be the only determining factors. You seem very focused on the investment aspect, but I think it is important that you ask yourself what you want from the money. (A financial advisor can help you answer this all-important question.)\n\nIs there a goal you\u2019re saving that money for? Does it need to support your income? Are you wanting to leave it to heirs? Your goals should drive your investment decisions. Don\u2019t invest in a vacuum.\n\nWorking With an Advisor\n\nA financial advisor goes over retirement investments with a client.\n\nI\u2019m curious about the way you tied rolling your 401(k) into an IRA, investing it 100% in stocks and letting an advisor manage it all together. Those are each independent decisions that aren\u2019t inherently connected.\n\nAgain, make sure you think through your goals and what you want to accomplish with the money. An advisor who is also a financial planner would help you with this. A financial planner can also help you make sense of how you should be investing given your goals and risk tolerance. I think that is key. Financial planners may also be able to manage your investments for you in a way that aligns with the plan the two of you lay out. (And if you\u2019re ready to work with a financial advisor, this tool can help you match with one.)\n\nBottom Line\n\nDon\u2019t make investment allocation decisions in a vacuum. Consider your personal situation, attitudes and goals. Then, choose an allocation that is most appropriate for you. This should be the approach whether you choose to do it on your own or with the help of an advisor.\n\nTips for Finding a Financial Advisor\n\nFinding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have free introductory calls with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nConsider a few advisors before settling on one. It\u2019s important to make sure you find someone you trust to manage your money. As you consider your options, these are the questions you should ask an advisor to ensure you make the right choice.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nBrandon Renfro, CFP\u00ae, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Added $58 Billion to This Ultrasafe Investment Over the Past Year, and He Expects to Add Tens of Billions More by the End of 2024",
        "body": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors of all time, and his track record supports that.\n\nSince taking control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's managed to increase the value of the business by 4,974,948%. That's a practically incomprehensible number, so I'll put it a different way: If you invested in Berkshire Hathaway when Buffett took over, you'd have more than 138 times the wealth you'd have if you'd just bought and held the S&P 500.\n\nBuffett took Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile business and turned it into a conglomerate with a huge insurance business and equity portfolio at its center. Investors watch Berkshire's equity portfolio changes closely to try to glean ideas from the Oracle of Omaha. But Buffett's been selling a lot more stocks than he's been buying lately.\n\nThere's one investment Buffett's been piling money into during the past year, though. Berkshire's position in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds increased by more than $58 billion over the past year as Buffett funds new purchases with stock sales and cash flows from Berkshire's core business. And he said he expects to add another $11 billion in the second quarter.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe only short-term investment Buffett likes\n\nBuffett is well-known as a long-term investor. He's famously quoted as saying \"our favorite holding period is forever\" when it comes to his best investment ideas for Berkshire. But not every investment should be held forever.\n\nIndeed, Buffett views short-term Treasuries as the best place to hold excess cash while he looks for good long-term investment opportunities. Practically all of Berkshire's cash gets invested in Treasury bonds that mature within one year, most within six months.\n\nBuffett explains why he insists on keeping funds in short-term government bonds in every quarterly report. \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments,\" he wrote in Berkshire's first-quarter earnings release.\n\nFor now, he's getting both safety and yield. Treasuries maturing within six months yield about 5.3%, as of this writing, more than a percentage point higher than the 10-year Treasury note. That's not typically the case. The inverted yield curve is the result of expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower rates over the next few years.\n\nBuffett hasn't always been a staunch advocate of short-term government bonds. It's a lesson learned from experience. He bought long-dated government bonds in the 1970s and later felt the impact of inflation on the investment. \"It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we did,\" he wrote in his 1979 letter to shareholders. \"We made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at losses, if necessary) when our present views began to crystallize.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe would much rather take a lower yield and let the bond reach maturity, then reinvest the proceeds at market rates, than gamble on where interest rates will be during the next 15 years. The fact that short-term bonds currently yield more than 5% is just icing on the cake. At Berkshire's 2024 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett said he'd still be sitting on short-term Treasuries even if yields were 1%.\n\nBuffett's going to keep buying\n\nDuring his opening remarks at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in May, Buffett predicted the company's cash and Treasury holdings will surpass $200 billion by the end of the second quarter. That's an $11 billion increase from the end of last quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nThat's tough to find, especially because \"a lot of money\" is now very different for Berkshire than it used to be -- its market value has ballooned to nearly $900 billion. \"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\" Buffett wrote in his most recent letter to shareholders. And he's not going to buy one unless it's attractively priced and has a margin of safety.\n\nBuffett's managed to add small amounts of some major businesses over the past year. He most recently took a large stake in Chubb, the insurance company. He continues to add to his stake in Occidental Petroleum. And Berkshire's also buying up large amounts of Liberty SiriusXM ahead of its merger with Sirius XM later this year.\n\nBut those purchases are relatively small compared to the amount of free cash flow that the core Berkshire Hathaway operations are generating every quarter. And with Buffett selling some stocks to take profits and take advantage of currently favorable tax rates, the cash keeps piling up.\n\nBerkshire is now more prepared than ever to strike when an opportunity presents itself. It could have the opportunity to buy all or some of a great company if the country faces an economic downturn, or more acute forces push specific sectors lower. In the meantime, an additional 5% return on $200 billion is a nice way to add $10 billion per year to Berkshire's pretax income.\n\nYou don't have to follow Buffett into Treasuries when you can simply buy Berkshire stock instead.\n\nWith shares trading at 18.7 times forward earnings, Berkshire Hathaway stock looks attractive. That's especially true when you take into account its huge cash position, Buffett's penchant for share repurchases, and his opinion that the present set of businesses under Berkshire have \"better prospects than exist at most large American companies.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Share prices of Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) have been in fine form so far in 2024, clocking gains of 48% as Wall Street turns bullish on the chipmaker's prospects. The market is excited about a turnaround in the smartphone market, its solid quarterly results, and a potential improvement in the fortunes of its largest customer -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAfter all, Cirrus is highly reliant on Apple for a major chunk of its top line. In the recently concluded fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 30), Apple accounted for a whopping 87% of Cirrus' revenue. Apple's share of Cirrus' top line has increased in recent years. Apple contracts accounted for 83% and 79% of its revenue in the preceding two fiscal years.\n\nWhile reliance on a single customer for so much business is not a good thing, a turnaround in Apple's fortunes related to its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) could be a blessing in disguise for Cirrus Logic. Here's why.\n\nCirrus Logic's largest customer could help accelerate its growth\n\nCirrus Logic is known for supplying audio codecs, camera controllers, fast-charging chips, and haptics solutions to smartphone customers like Apple. It posted $372 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which was flat on a year-over-year basis but crushed the Wall Street estimate of $317 million. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up an impressive 35% year over year to $1.24 per share, and the figure was nearly double the $0.64 per share consensus estimate.\n\nAdditionally, Cirrus' forecast of $320 million in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range added to investors' bullishness as it was better than the $302 million analyst estimate. The guidance points toward a small jump in the top line from the prior-year period's figure of $317 million.\n\nSo Cirrus' fortunes are closely tied to Apple. This explains why Cirrus' top-line growth wasn't solid last quarter. Apple's iPhone shipments, for instance, fell almost 10% year over year in the first quarter of calendar 2024, according to market research firm IDC. Sales of iPads and wearables also dropped. As a result, Apple's overall revenue was down 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 30).\n\nThe good news for Cirrus Logic is that Apple's iPhone sales are expected to pick up pace as the year progresses, thanks to the proliferation of AI. Market research firm Counterpoint Research estimates that the AI smartphone market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% through 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Apple doesn't have an AI-capable phone in its portfolio yet (unlike Samsung), the company recently announced a slew of AI-related features that are expected to make their way to the next iPhone, which will go on sale later this year. From allowing users to leverage AI to summarize text to creating original images to transcribing phone calls, Apple has unveiled multiple features that could help it jump onto the AI bandwagon.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee believes that the integration of AI-specific features in the 2024 iPhone models is likely to spur a solid upgrade cycle and help Apple sell more smartphones. More specifically, Chatterjee expects Apple to sell 244 million iPhone units in fiscal 2025, which would be a 10% increase from the estimated shipments in the current fiscal year. The momentum is expected to continue in fiscal 2026, with estimated shipments of 268 million units.\n\nMoreover, as the tech giant's Apple Intelligence platform is compatible only with the iPhone 15 Pro series and iPads and MacBooks powered by M1 chips, the company could witness the arrival of a solid device upgrade cycle. JPMorgan estimates that this new upgrade cycle will be equal to what Apple witnessed when 5G smartphones arrived, and it is worth noting that the tech specialist's growth took off at that time.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is expected to release MacBooks with AI-capable chips this year, which would allow the company to tap another potentially lucrative market. All this bodes well for Cirrus Logic and explains why analysts have been turning bullish about its prospects.\n\nImproving growth could lead to more stock upside\n\nCirrus Logic's revenue in fiscal 2024 was down almost 6% from the previous year to $1.79 billion. However, analysts are expecting it to report a small improvement in the current fiscal year, which is evident from the following chart.\n\nCRUS Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above indicates, analysts increased their revenue guidance for the next fiscal year and expect Cirrus to deliver stronger growth. The prospects of AI-enabled smartphones and PCs and Cirrus' relationship with a top player such as Apple in these markets should help it sustain healthy growth for a long time to come.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to buy Cirrus Logic stock while it is still cheap. This semiconductor stock trades at 26 times trailing earnings right now, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's trailing earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). We saw that Cirrus' earnings accelerated nicely in the previous quarter, and the company could sustain that trend with Apple's help.\n\nAs such, there is a good chance that Cirrus may be able to add to the already impressive gains it clocked in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cirrus Logic right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cirrus Logic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cirrus Logic wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "The S&P 500 is near its all-time high, but not all stocks are doing so well. That's especially the case in the real estate sector, where some of the highest-quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are trading for 20% or more below their all-time highs.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three excellent REITs, all of which are S&P 500 components, that are worth a closer look while they're on sale.\n\nBuilt for steady income no matter what\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the largest and most popular REITs in the market, with a massive portfolio of properties and reliable monthly dividend income. In fact, Realty Income has a trademark on the phrase \"The Monthly Dividend Company.\" And now, this top-notch stock is down by 35% from its peak.\n\nRealty Income has over 15,400 properties in the U.S. and Europe, and about 80% of the portfolio is retail in nature. But the company acquires properties occupied by tenants that are in recession-resistant and e-commerce-resistant forms of retail. Think dollar stores, drug stores, warehouse clubs, and other properties that tend to hold up well in tough economies. Tenants sign long-term (10-plus-year) leases with annual rent increases built in. All Realty Income has to do is get a quality tenant in place and enjoy year after year of reliably growing income.\n\nTo be clear, the decline in Realty Income is mainly due to the current interest rate climate, as opposed to anything wrong with Realty Income's business. The company's income stream continues to grow predictably, and the dividend has now been raised for 107 consecutive quarters with a 5.9% current yield.\n\nThe world's largest REIT is on sale\n\nPrologis (NYSE: PLD) isn't just the largest industrial REIT in the market, it is the largest real estate investment trust of any kind. And now you can buy shares for more than 35% below its 2022 all-time high.\n\nThe company owns logistics real estate, such as distribution centers and warehouses. If you've ever seen one of those massive Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) distribution centers, there's a decent chance it's a Prologis-owned property. In all, Prologis owns 1.2 billion square feet of rentable space on four continents.\n\nPrologis has fallen recently, and one big reason is oversupply fears in the industrial space, but this should be a temporary headwind if anything. While industrial demand is strong, new inventory is expected to drop considerably in 2024 and 2025, and this should help balance the market.\n\nIn the meantime, Prologis has been a massive beneficiary of embedded rent growth. In a nutshell, industrial property rental rates soared during the pandemic, but because tenants are on long-term leases, the company only benefits as its leases renew. We're still seeing the effects of this -- in the most recent quarter, Prologis' leasing spread on both new and renewal leases was a staggering 69.5% (so, if a tenant was paying $10,000 per month, he or she would be paying $16,950 on average after renewing). This is likely to be a long-tailed trend, and Prologis' income growth could be surprisingly strong for the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn industry leader with tons of potential\n\nVici Properties (NYSE: VICI) is by far the youngest REIT of the three, and it has held up better than the other two in the rising-rate environment, with its stock down by just 21% from the highs.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, think of Vici as the leading owner of gaming real estate. It owns the real estate of some of the most valuable Las Vegas Strip properties, including The Venetian, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and more. It also owns many regional properties, including top-tier properties like The Borgata in Atlantic City and MGM National Harbor in DC.\n\nNot only is Vici likely to benefit from the tailwinds provided by the legalized gaming trend in the United States, which should create acquisition opportunities over the coming years, but the company is just starting to branch out into non-gaming real estate. It recently acquired a portfolio of Bowlero entertainment centers, and aims to continue to look for compelling opportunities in the massive experiential real estate market. With a 5.9% dividend yield that is well supported by its funds from operations, Vici could provide a nice combination of growth and income for years to come.\n\nA great entry point for long-term investors\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm not saying that these stocks are going to rebound to their all-time highs quickly. I have absolutely no idea what they'll do over the next few weeks or months, and if the interest rate environment stays elevated, I'd expect them to underperform in the short term. However, these are three reliable income generators with top-notch leadership, and if you measure your investment returns in decades, buying top-quality S&P 500 components like these when they are 20% or more off the highs is an excellent long-term investment strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

The VVR Plan and the VLT Plan are collectively referred to herein as the \"Plans.\"\n\nThe Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") of Invesco Senior Income Trust (NYSE: VVR) (the \"Fund\") approved an increase in the monthly distribution amount payable to common shareholders pursuant to the Fund's Managed Distribution Plan (the \"Plan\"). Effective October 1, 2023 , the Fund will pay its monthly dividend to common shareholders at a stated fixed monthly distribution amount of $0.0430 per share, an increase from a stated fixed monthly distribution amount of $0.0390 per share.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the sources indicated. You should not draw any conclusions about the Funds' investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Plans. All amounts are expressed per common share. Each Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution is estimated to be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Funds' investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend on each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\n1 A portion of this distribution is estimated to be from a return of principal rather than net income. The Section 19 notice referenced below provides more information and can be found on the Invesco website at www.invesco.com.\n\nFund June 2024 Net Investment Income Net Realized Capital\n\nGains Estimated Return of\n\nPrincipal (or Other\n\nCapital Source) Total\n\nCurrent\n\nDistribution\n\n(common\n\nshare) Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of\n\nCurrent\n\nDistribution Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of\n\nCurrent\n\nDistribution Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of\n\nCurrent\n\nDistribution Invesco High Income Trust II $0.0680 70.54 % $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0284 29.46 % $0.0964 Invesco Senior Income Trust $0.0271 63.02 % $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0159 36.98 % $0.0430\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFund CUMULATIVE FISCAL YEAR-TO-DATE (YTD) May 31, 2024 Net Investment Income Net Realized Capital\n\nGains Return of Principal (or\n\nOther Capital Source) Total FYTD\n\nDistribution\n\n(common\n\nshare) Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of 2024\n\nDistribution Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of 2024\n\nDistribution Per\n\nShare\n\nAmount % of 2024\n\nDistribution Invesco High Income Trust II $0.1393 48.17 % $0.0000 0.00 % $0.1499 51.83 % $0.2892 Invesco Senior Income Trust $0.1074 83.26 % $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0216 16.74 % $0.1290\n\nForm 1099-DIV for the calendar year will report distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund's annual report to shareholders will include information regarding the tax character of Fund distributions for the fiscal year. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in 2024 will be made after the end of the year.\n\nThe monthly distributions are based on estimates and terms of each Fund's Plan. Monthly distribution amounts may vary from these estimates based on a multitude of factors. Changes in portfolio and market conditions may cause deviations from estimates. These estimates should not be taken as indication of a Fund's earnings and performance. The actual amounts and its sources may be subject to additional adjustments and will be reported after year end.\n\nEach Fund's Performance and Distribution Rate Information disclosed in the table below is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Fiscal Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate and the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate. Each Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. NAV performance may be indicative of a Fund's investment performance. The value of a shareholder's investment in each Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nFunds' Performance and Distribution Rate Information:\n\nFund Fiscal Year-to-date March 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 Five year period ending\n\nMay 31, 2024 FYTD\n\nCumulative\n\nTotal Return1 Cumulative\n\nDistribution\n\nRate 2 Current\n\nAnnualized\n\nDistribution\n\nRate 3 Average Annual Total\n\nReturn 4 Invesco High Income Trust II 12.59 % 2.55 % 10.19 % 3.66 % Invesco Senior Income Trust 15.11 % 3.19 % 12.74 % 6.29 %\n\n1 Fiscal year-to-date Cumulative Total Return assumes reinvestment of distributions. This is calculated as the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over the fiscal year-to-date time period including distributions paid and reinvested.\n\n2 Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund's current fiscal period ( March 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 ) is calculated as the dollar value of distributions in the fiscal year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2024 .\n\n3 The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period's distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2024 .\n\n4 Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending May 31, 2024 . Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year including distributions paid and reinvested.\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, each Fund will provide its shareholders of record on the record date with a 19(a) Notice disclosing the sources of its dividend payment when a distribution includes anything other than net investment income.\n\nThe Plans will be subject to periodic review by each Fund's Board, and a Fund's Board may terminate or amend the terms of its Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders. The amendment or termination of a Fund's Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of such Fund's common shares.\n\nThe amount of dividends paid by each fund may vary from time to time. Past amounts of dividends are no guarantee of future dividend payment amounts.\n\nInvesting involves risk and it is possible to lose money on any investment in the funds.\n\nFor additional information, shareholders of the closed end fund may contact\n\nBeverly Khoo , 332-323-8029 beverly.khoo@invesco.com\n\nAbout Invesco Ltd.\n\nInvesco Ltd. is a global independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering an investment experience that helps people get more out of life.

        "body": "-Results in Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL v2.0) Continue to Show Slowing of Disease Progression in Later-Stage DMD Patients-\n\n\n\n-Improvements Seen in Multiple Cardiac Endpoints Demonstrating Stabilization of Cardiac Function Over 3 Years of Treatment-\n\n-Pre-BLA Meeting with FDA Scheduled for Q3 2024 to Discuss Options to Expedite BLA Filing-\n\n-Results to be Presented at PPMD Annual Conference on June 29 in Session titled Approaches to Alter Progression-\n\nSAN DIEGO, June 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capricor Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), a biotechnology company developing transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases, today announced additional positive 3-year safety and efficacy results from its ongoing HOPE-2 open label extension (OLE) study with its lead asset, deramiocel (CAP-1002), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nData from the HOPE-2 OLE study demonstrated improvements in multiple cardiac measures, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as indexed volumes (left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV)). These are measures of cardiac function and are considered highly relevant in terms of predicting long-term outcomes. In addition, greater improvements in cardiac function were observed in those patients that had higher ejection fractions (> 45%) at the beginning of the HOPE-2 randomized trial. Published data supports the need for early intervention in order to maintain function and potentially slow the progression of the cardiomyopathy, one of the leading causes of death in patients with DMD. Currently, there is no approved treatment specifically for DMD cardiomyopathy, which underscores the need for additional therapies to treat DMD. Additionally, as previously reported, patients showed a statistically significant benefit (+3.7 points, p< 0.001) in the PUL v2.0 total score when compared to an external comparator dataset of similar DMD patients. The HOPE-2 OLE study continues to show a favorable safety profile for long-term treatment of deramiocel. These data will be shared at this year's Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) 30th Annual Conference being held in Orlando, Florida on June 29, 2024.\n\n3-Year HOPE-2 OLE Study Results\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\nSkeletal muscle (upper-limb function) 3-year timepoint\n\nChange from baseline Delta change\n\np-value\n\n\n\nPerformance of upper limb (PUL v2.0)\n\nDeramiocel (n=12) External comparator (n=32) -4.1 points -7.8 points +3.7 points\n\np< 0.001\n\nExternal comparator PUL data provided by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC)\n\nBaseline is referred to as start of HOPE-2 OLE study, changes in means are shown\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\nCardiac function 3-year timepoint\n\nChange from baseline Deramiocel (n=10) Deramiocel (n=8)\n\nPatients with >45% LVEF at end of HOPE-2 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF %)\n\nPositive value indicates improvement +1.2% +3.0% Indexed volumes\n\nNegative value indicates improvement LV end systolic volume, indexed (mL/m2 ) -2.4 -5.1 LV end diastolic volume, indexed (mL/m2) -5.7 -10.0\n\nBaseline is referred to as start of HOPE-2 study, changes in medians are shown; 3-year timepoint on HOPE-2 OLE corresponds to 5 years post HOPE-2 Baseline\n\nAll cardiac outcomes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)\n\n10 of 12 participants were able to receive MRI\n\nThe results of the open label study are tremendously important for DMD patients, as they showed sustained skeletal and cardiac benefits after 3 years of continuous treatment with deramiocel, which underscores the potential long-term benefits this therapy can offer patients with DMD, said Linda Marb\u00c3\u00a1n, Ph.D., Capricor's chief executive officer. Based on our HOPE-2 OLE data and prior clinical results, we plan to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) options to expedite our Biologics License Application (BLA) filing. We continue to work closely with FDA with the goal of bringing deramiocel to patients as quickly as possible and look forward to sharing further updates as they become available. We thank the patients, their families and the broader Duchenne community for continuing to work with us throughout the development of this promising therapy.\n\nThe PPMD Annual Conference is the largest annual, international event focused on the latest research, clinical trials and care initiatives for DMD. Now in its 30th year, the meeting is attended by researchers, caregivers and patients looking to interact and drive change in the fight to end DMD. For more information, or to register, please click here. Capricor plans to make its presentation available on the publications section of the Company's website following the formal conference presentation.\n\nAbout HOPE-2 Open Label Extension (OLE) Study\n\nHOPE-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical study of Capricor's lead investigational therapy, deramiocel, in boys and young men who have DMD. Study patients were treated via intravenous delivery with either deramiocel (150 million cells per infusion) or placebo every 3 months. Data from a total of 20 patients was analyzed (12 placebo and 8 treated) at the 12-month time-point and the results were published in The Lancet. After the completion of the HOPE-2 study, all patients stopped treatment for approximately 392 days (mean, range [239, 567]), which is referred to as the gap phase. Then all eligible patients who wished to remain on treatment entered the HOPE-2-OLE study where they receive deramiocel (150 million cells per infusion) every three months. The HOPE-2-OLE study previously met its primary endpoint at the one-year timepoint on the PUL v2.0 (p=0.02). The HOPE-2-OLE study remains ongoing and into its fourth year and participants continue to be monitored for safety, cardiac and functional performance.\n\nAbout Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and chronic inflammation of the skeletal, heart and respiratory muscles with mortality at a median age of approximately 30 years. It is estimated that DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 male births and that the patient population is estimated to be approximately 15,000-20,000 in the United States. DMD pathophysiology is driven by the impaired production of functional dystrophin, which normally functions as a structural protein in muscle. The reduction of functional dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. Treatment options are limited and there is no cure.\n\nAbout Capricor Therapeutics\n\nCapricor Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) is a biotechnology company dedicated to advancing transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics to redefine the treatment landscape for rare diseases. At the forefront of our innovation is our lead product candidate, deramiocel (CAP-1002), an allogeneic cardiac-derived cell therapy.

        "body": "Dollar gains after first presidential debate\n\nFocus today turns to core PCE inflation\n\nYen slides, intervention risks rise\n\nFrench citizens head to the ballots on Sunday\n\nTrump Election Win Bets Support Dollar\n\nThe traded slightly lower against most of its major peers on Thursday, extending gains only against the and the . That said, the greenback is on the front foot again today, gaining the most ground versus the and the .\n\nWhat helped the dollar move higher during the Asian session today may have been the debate between the 2024 presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with the latter seen as putting in a stronger showing than the incumbent President.\n\nThe likelihood of Trump returning to the Oval Office could mean lower corporate taxes, tougher trade relations, and consequently more advances on Wall Street and higher Treasury yields. The prospect of more tariffs on China may be the reason why the dollar is gaining the most against the aussie and the kiwi, as China is the main trading partner of both Australia and New Zealand.\n\nPCE Inflation Expected to Cool\n\nToday, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation metric. Expectations are for a slowdown to 2.6% y/y from 2.8%, something supported by the slide in the core CPI rate for the month.\n\nCurrently, market participants are penciling in around a 70% chance of a first quarter-point reduction by the Fed in September. Thus, a slide in the core PCE rate may encourage them to take that percentage higher and thereby sell some dollars.\n\nYen Traders Stay on Intervention Watch\n\nThe yen continued to bleed, with the dollar/yen briefly breaking above 161 earlier today as traders continued to test the nerves of Japanese authorities, which have lately become vocal again about one-sided declines in their currency.\n\nThe acceleration in the Tokyo CPI figures for June passed unnoticed by yen traders, though the probability of another 10bps hike by the BoJ in July remained elevated at around 60%.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that today, the Japanese government replaced the nation\u2019s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda with financial regulation expert Atsushi Mimura. With Finance Minister Suzuki noting that authorities remain \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the impact of steep yen declines, Kanda\u2019s replacement may have increased the risk for a new intervention episode soon.\n\nIn light of this, yen traders may now be keener to cover some of their short positions to minimize potential losses in case of intervention, something that could result in a small setback in the dollar/yen.\n\nFrench Election, Round One\n\nIn Europe, the spotlight is turning to the first round of the French elections. If no candidate gets an absolute majority, which is the most likely case, the top two candidates, and any other that receives more than 12.5% of the registered votes, move to a second round.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally is likely to secure the most seats in Parliament, but not a majority. The far-left New Popular Front is seen second and Macron\u2019s Ensemble coalition third.\n\nThis first round could shed light on how likely it is for Le Pen to form a coalition with smaller parties after the second round, or whether the nation will be left with a completely hung parliament. Given that no election can take place for another year under the French Constitution after this, a hung parliament may be the worst-case scenario for the as the Eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy will enter a prolonged period of political stalemate.",

Fed Chair Powell at the ECB Forum - July 2\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome is set to make an appearance at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, July 2.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nPowell has used this platform in the past to pre-announce key policy decisions, making his remarks potentially pivotal.\n\nInvestors will scrutinize his speech for hints about the Fed's future policy direction, especially ahead of the critical FOMC meeting at the end of the month.\n\n2. U.S. Jobs Report - Friday, July 5\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department will release the monthly jobs report at 8:30 AM ET on Friday, July 5, and it will be a critical indicator of the health of the U.S. labor market.\n\nWith employment numbers serving as a bellwether for economic stability and growth, investors will be keenly observing job creation, , and wage growth. Forecasts center around a continued solid pace of hiring, even if the increase is smaller than in previous months.\n\nThe consensus estimate is that the the U.S. economy added 180,000 positions in June, slowing from jobs growth of 272,000 in May. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.0%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nA strong jobs report could reinforce confidence in the economy, while weaker-than-expected numbers might raise concerns about a potential slowdown.\n\n3. U.S. CPI Data - Thursday, July 11\n\nOn Thursday, July 11, the Consumer Price Index ( ) inflation data will be released. This report will be closely monitored as inflation remains a central issue for both the Federal Reserve and the broader market.\n\nWhile no official forecasts have been set yet, expectations for annual headline CPI range from an increase of 3.0% to 3.2%, compared to a 3.3% annual pace in May.\n\nMeanwhile, estimates for the year-on-year figure - which does not include food and energy prices - center around an increase of 3.1%-3.3%, compared to May\u2019s 3.4% reading.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe headline annual CPI rate peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1% in the summer of 2022 and has been on a steady downtrend since, however, prices are still rising at a pace well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target range despite a series of 11 rate hikes.\n\nAny surprises in the inflation figures could significantly impact market sentiment and expectations for future Fed policy actions.\n\n4. Q2 Earnings Season Kickoff - July 12\n\nThe second-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday, July 12 with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) releasing its quarterly results. Earnings reports will be crucial in assessing the health and performance of corporate America amid economic uncertainties.\n\nKey companies reporting in July include:\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: ) on July 23\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) on July 24\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) on July 25\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: ) on July 30\n\nThese tech giants, which have been major contributors to the market's year-to-date rally, will be under the spotlight. Their earnings and guidance will provide valuable insights into the state of the tech sector and broader market trends.\n\nSome of the other notable companies reporting results also include Bank of America (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), United Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), ExxonMobil (NYSE: ), and Chevron (NYSE: ).\n\nFOMC Meeting - Wednesday, July 31\n\nThe Federal Reserve's FOMC policy meeting on Wednesday, July 31 will arguably be the most anticipated event of the month.\n\nWith ongoing debates about the appropriate timing for rate cuts, the Fed's statement and Chairman Powell's subsequent press conference will be closely watched.\n\nThe FOMC is not publishing updated \u2018dot-plot\u2019 economic forecasts, and so any changes in the Fed's tone or policy outlook could have significant implications for the stock market.\n\nAs of Friday morning, financial markets are pricing in a roughly 90% chance of no action, according to the Investing.com . That would leave the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nComing into 2024, investors were expecting multiple rate cuts. However, stubbornly high levels of inflation and signs of a resilient economy have continually pushed back that possibility.\n\nConclusion\n\nJuly promises to be a month packed with critical events that could shape the stock market's trajectory for the remainder of the year. From key economic data releases to pivotal central bank meetings and corporate earnings reports, investors must stay vigilant and prepared for potential volatility.\n\nTo navigate the current market backdrop I used the InvestingPro stock screener to build a watchlist of high-quality stocks that are showing strong relative strength and have healthy growth prospects.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of the names to make the list include Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: ) to name a few.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging backdrop of elevated inflation, high interest rates, and mounting geopolitical turmoil.\n\nReaders of this article can subscribe to InvestingPro for less than $7 a month as part of our summer sale.\n\nTo apply the discount, don't forget to use the coupon codes PROTIPS2024 (yearly) and PROTIPS20242 (bi-yearly).\n\nSubscribe here and unlock access to:\n\nFair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\nInstantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.

        "title": "Gold, Euro Rise as US Dollar Weakens; Bitcoin Surges on Trump-Biden Debate",
        "body": "Gold Jumps as the US Dollar Weakens Due to Slowing US Economy\n\nThe (XAU) price rose by more than 1% on Thursday as the (USD) weakened after weaker-than-expected core durable goods orders and housing data.\n\nYesterday's US macroeconomic statistics underscored the slowing of the economy. Specifically, yesterday's final Gross Domestic Product data revealed a significant decrease in the US economic growth in Q1. Additionally, business spending on equipment fell in May, while a decline in exports widened the trade deficit in goods. As a result, the probability of two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024 increased, pushing the US dollar down and making gold more attractive for holders of other currencies.\n\nMoreover, investors were anticipating the debate between two US presidential candidates. The market also closely monitored any signs that the Japanese government might step in to support the Japanese yen, which remained near its lowest level in 38 years. This uncertainty boosted the demand for gold, a traditional safe-haven asset during economic and political turmoil.\n\nXAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders focused on the key US inflation data, which is due later today. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. The data is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the report will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If PCE figures are higher than expected, XAU/USD will almost certainly drop, possibly below 2,290. Conversely, lower-than-expected numbers may extend the short-term bullish trend in gold.\n\n\"Spot gold may retest support at $2,299 per ounce, as the bounce triggered by this barrier is considered random\", said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.\n\nThe Euro Rises on a Weaker US Dollar, but French Elections Produce Uncertainty\n\nThe (EUR) gained 0.22% against the US dollar (USD) on Thursday but failed to hold above the important 1.07150 level.\n\nSoft economic data from the US sparked a sell-off in the US dollar yesterday, as investors continue to believe that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver two rate cuts in 2024. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to provide two 25-basis-point (bps) rate cuts this year, but the market is confident that the ECB should generally remain more dovish than the Fed. Germany reported yesterday that its import prices dropped by 0.4% in May, while the market anticipated only a 0.3% decline. The euro faces additional pressure from political instability as France gears up for a snap election this weekend. France is already subject to E.U. disciplinary measures due to its budget deficit. Now, the fact that far-right nationalist parties are leading the polls has further exacerbated concerns about France's fiscal sustainability.\n\nEUR/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders started to reposition ahead of today's US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index report, due at 12:30 p.m. UTC. It is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation and will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If the figures are higher than expected, EUR/USD will likely drop, possibly below the 1.06600 level. Otherwise, the pair may rise above 1.07200.\n\nBitcoin Surged on Trump-Biden Debate\n\n(BTC) rose overnight by more than 1% as the market favored Trump in a debate with Biden.\n\nBitcoin was trading near 61,485 before the debate between two presidential candidates began but quickly surged towards 62,157 as Donald Trump and Joe Biden responded to questions from CNN moderators. Although not directly mentioned in the debate, cryptocurrency has become a significant point of interest in the election confrontation. On 16 June, Trump stated he would end Biden's 'war on crypto' if he is elected. In March, Trump made a post expressing his intention to make the US a global leader in crypto technology and criticized Biden, saying the current President would see crypto 'die a slow and painful death'.\n\nHowever, President Biden recently vetoed a resolution that would have repealed a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting guideline preventing banks from holding crypto assets on their balance sheets. Notably, the resolution passed through both the House and the Senate with majority support. Biden explained his decision, saying he refused to pass legislation that would 'jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors'.\n\nAfter the debates, slowly returned towards 61,485 in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. In theory, lower-than-expected figures should positively impact BTC/USD, potentially pushing the price above 62,000. However, the bearish trend in the pair may continue if the figures are better than expected.",

        "body": "by Jack Fischer\n\nDuring LSEG Lipper\u2019s fund-flows week that ended June 19, 2024, investors were overall net redeemers of fund assets (including both conventional funds and ETFs) for the first week in three, removing a net $30.0 billion.\n\nThis past week, money market funds (-$23.5 billion), equity funds (-$7.4 billion), commodities funds (-$697 million), and mixed-assets funds (-$293 million) suffered outflows.\n\nTaxable bond funds (+$1.5 billion), alternative investments (+$797 million), and tax-exempt bond funds (+$16 million) posted net inflows.\n\nBoth active (-$3.9 billion) and passive (-$3.4 billion) equity funds suffered outflows. Actively managed equity funds have seen 13 straight weeks of outflows, while passive equity funds logged their second straight outflow. Last week passive equity funds saw their third-largest weekly outflow in more than the past 500 weeks\u2014the largest since the week ending February 7, 2018.\n\nActive (-$566 million) fixed-income funds recorded their first weekly outflow in five weeks. Passive (+$2.1 billion) fixed-income funds reported their sixth inflow over the last seven weeks.\n\nIn aggregate, ETFs saw an outflow (-$468 million) over the week, led by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSE: ) (FBTC, -$255 million). FBTC\u2019s $11.0 billion in AUM represents 19.5% of the spot ETF market.\n\nIndex Performance\n\nAt the close of LSEG Lipper\u2019s fund-flows week, U.S. broad-based equity indices reported mostly positive returns\u2014 (+1.22%), (+1.44%), and (+0.32%). The Nasdaq has realized seven straight weeks of positive returns. The small-cap-focused (-1.55%) ended in the red for the fourth week in five.\n\nBroad-based fixed income indices also saw mostly plus-side returns\u2014FTSE U.S. Broad Investment Grade Bond Total Return Index (+0.68%) and FTSE Municipal Tax-Exempt Investment Grade Bond Index (+0.33%) recorded gains. The FTSE High Yield Market Total Return Index (-0.13%) logged its first loss in three weeks.\n\nOverseas broad-based indices struggled with the Total Return (-3.91%), (-0.97%), (-2.11%), S&P/TSX Composite (-2.10%), and (-0.68%) all seeing losses.\n\nRates/Yields\n\nBoth the (-1.28%) and (-2.66%) Treasury yield fell over the course of the week. Since the start of the year, both yields have risen (+10.87% and +9.03%, respectively).\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average (FRM) decreased for the sixth week in seven, with the weekly average currently at 6.87%. Both the (DXY, +0.58%) and (+2.11%) increased over the course of the week.\n\nFor the next meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool has the likelihood of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates unchanged at 89.7%. This tool forecasted a 22.8% possibility of a 25-bps cut one month ago. The next meeting is scheduled for July 31, 2024.\n\nExchange-Traded Equity Funds\n\nExchange-traded equity funds recorded a $1.6 billion weekly outflow\u2014its third in four weeks. The macro-group posted a 0.56% gain on the week, its third straight week in the black.\n\nLarge-cap ETFs (-$2.2 billion), multi-cap ETFs (-$408 million), and world sector equity ETFs (-$237 million) posted the largest outflows. Under large-cap ETFs, the S&P 500 Index Funds Lipper classification continue to suffer (-$4.4 billion). Last week this classification took home the headline, seeing its largest outflow on record (-$17.4 billion).\n\nSector equity ETFs (+$815 million), equity income ETFs (+$318 million), and mid-cap ETFs (+$280 million) witnessed the top weekly inflows under equity ETFs. Lipper\u2019s Science and Technology ETF (+$579 million) classification was the top classification under sector equity ETFs for the second straight week.\n\nOver the past fund-flows week, the two top equity ETF flow attractors were iShares S&P 500 Core ETF (NYSE: ) (IVV, +$18.1 billion) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: ) (QQQ, +$1.9 billion).\n\nMeanwhile, the two bottom equity ETFs in terms of weekly outflows were SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX: ) (SPY, -$22.9 billion) and Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: ) (SOXL, -$1.2 billion).\n\nExchange-Traded Fixed Income Funds\n\nExchange-traded taxable fixed income funds observed a $3.2 billion weekly inflow\u2014the macro group\u2019s sixth weekly inflow in seven weeks. Fixed income ETFs reported a gain of 0.49% on average, marking the second gain in three weeks.\n\nGovernment & Treasury ETFs (+$1.2 billion), short/intermediate government & Treasury ETFs (+$873 million), and short/intermediate investment-grade ETFs (+$565 million) were the top subgroups under taxable bond ETFs to observe inflows. Government & Treasury ETFs have posted 17 inflows over the last 20 weeks and have seen eight straight.\n\nEmerging markets debt ETFs (-$19 million) was the only taxable fixed income subgroup to record an outflow on the week. Emerging markets debt ETFs have posted three weekly outflows in four weeks.\n\nMunicipal bond ETFs reported a $150 million inflow over the week, marking the third consecutive weekly inflow and seventh over the last 10. Municipal bond ETFs also realized their third gain (+0.29%) in as many weeks.\n\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ: ) ETF (TLT, +$481 million) and iShares MBS ETF (NASDAQ: ) (MBB, +$444 million) attracted the largest amounts of weekly net new money under fixed income ETFs.\n\nOn the other hand, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: ) (HYG, -$400 million) and SPDR\u00ae Blackstone (NYSE: ) Senior Loan ETF (NYSE: ) (SRLN, -$270 million) suffered the largest weekly outflows.\n\nConventional Equity Funds\n\nConventional equity funds (ex-ETFs) witnessed weekly outflows (-$5.7 billion) for the one-hundred-and-twenty-third straight week. Conventional equity funds posted a weekly return of positive 0.19%, the third straight week of gains.\n\nLarge-cap funds (-$2.4 billion), mid-cap funds (-$859 million), and multi-cap funds (-$845 million) were the top conventional equity fund subgroups to realize weekly outflows. Large-cap conventional mutual funds logged their twenty-eighth outflow over the past 30 weeks, led by the Large-Cap Growth classification (-$952 million).\n\nNo subgroup under conventional equity mutual funds reported an inflow over the trailing week.\n\nConventional Fixed Income Funds\n\nConventional taxable-fixed income funds realized an outflow of $1.6 billion\u2014marking the eighth outflow over the past 10 weeks. The macro-group realized a gain of 0.38% on average\u2014their second plus-side return in three weeks.\n\nShort/intermediate investment-grade funds (-$1.0 billion), general domestic taxable fixed income funds (-$252 million), and high yield funds (-$115 million) led taxable fixed income subgroups in net outflows. Short/intermediate investment-grade funds suffered their eighth outflow in 10 weeks, led by the Core Plus Bond Funds classification (-$651 million).\n\nAlternative bond funds (+$40 million) was the only taxable fixed income subgroup to observe inflows over the week as they observed their seventh weekly intake in eight.\n\nMunicipal bond conventional funds (ex-ETFs) returned a positive 0.48% over the fund-flows week, giving the subgroup its third straight weekly gain. Tax-exempt fixed income mutual funds experienced a $134 million outflow, marking the seventh outflow in 10 weeks.",

        "body": "Perhaps the most apt metaphor to describe the decade ahead is that investors, consumers and taxpayers will all be rafting whitewater rapids with ever-briefer stretches of calm.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical/financial risks are proliferating and becoming more difficult to predict or hedge for a very basic reason: the era of global integration and accord has ended and the era of global disintegration and discord is heating up. In historian Peter Turchin's terminology, when everyone finds reasons to cooperate, the result is an era of accord; when everyone finds reasons not to cooperate, the result is an era of discord.\n\n\n\nBeneath the chaotic swirl of complex dynamics and risk, two core drivers emerge: de-globalization and de-financialization.\n\n\n\nThe 30-year era of increasing globalization has reversed, reducing the influence of markets and increasing the influence of national security. Where the globalization era led to global trade agreements which served at least a few of every participant's core interests, the de-globalization era will be characterized by fragmentation and deals being cut between nations outside of traditional alliances and ideological camps.\n\n\n\nIn the neoliberal worldview, markets are solutions to virtually every problem: open up markets and let price discovery and innovations solve all problems. This construct is ideologically appealing, but in the real world, markets generated extremely risky supply-chain dependencies on unreliable offshore sources: yes, these dependencies were efficient and profitable, but when things fall apart, they cause dominoes to fall far beyond what \"markets\" anticipated or could hedge.\n\n\n\nThe 50-year era of increasing financialization has also reversed. In a nutshell, financialization optimized capital at the expense of labor/wage earners, and optimized speculation via the vast expansion of credit and leverage, enabling finance to commoditize virtually everything in the global economy: labor, capital, goods, services and yes, even risk.\n\n\n\nBut commoditized risk that can be hedged only includes the risks that are visible and known. When extremes become more extreme, the potential for risk to escape the neatly fenced corral of hedged risk increases in ways that cannot be quantified and hedged.\n\n\n\nI tend to think many observers focus too narrowly on risks arising from financial crises, for example, a crisis in the multi-trillion dollar shadowy derivatives market that could cascade as holders of derivative contracts with claims on underlying collateral (for example, the homes underlying mortgages in a mortgage-backed security) start seizing the collateralized assets embedded in the derivatives chain.\n\n\n\nWhile I make no claim to understanding \"The Great Taking\" scenario and cannot vouch for its accuracy, the basic idea is well-established: derivatives (such as CLOs and CDOs, as well as many even more exotic concoctions) can include claims on the underlying collateral of debt-based assets such as homes or vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe risk few seem to be discussing is not the seizure itself but the political firestorm any such seizure would ignite. The public has tolerated a stinking mass of self-serving bailouts and insider dealings under the threat of \"if we don't do this, the entire system collapses in a heap\" for the past 15 years, but their patience with financier strip-mining may run out more quickly than the political elites imagine.\n\n\n\nHistory suggests that social revolutions often start spontaneously from an apparently trivial event: the deadwood of a corrupt system rigged to funnel asymmetric rewards to the few at the expense of the many finally catches fire, and quickly becomes a conflagration.\n\n\n\nWhile many commentators have noted China continues reducing its holdings of US Treasuries (UST) and the general trend of de-dollarization, i.e. offloading Treasuries and seeking payment mechanisms that do not include the (USD), few seem to ponder what risks might arise in other currency flows, for example, the capital sloshing around the global economy as Direct Foreign Investment (FDI), money that flows into an economy as investments in assets such as manufacturing, mining, housing, tourism, etc.\n\n\n\nJust as capital flowing in or out of sovereign bonds reflects the interests of each participating nation, so too do FDI investment flows and the sales and purchases of Strategically Significant Commodities.\n\n\n\nI would characterize this vast reshuffling of global capital flows as a direct consequence of two factors:\n\n\n\n1. The ascendence of national security over market incentives (i.e. profits, mercantilist exports, etc.)\n\n\n\n2. The fragmentation of broad trade agreements in favor of special deals with trading partners that include not just tariffs but access to Strategically Significant Commodities and investment capital flows.\n\n\n\nIn other words, trade is no longer about opening new markets for mercantilist exports and parking surplus dollars in Treasuries, it's about securing essential commodities and capital flows in exchange for access to supply chains and financial markets.\n\n\n\nThe mercantilist era has ended: so-called free trade (there is no such thing) that created critical national-security-related dependencies on frenemies is now something to avoid and reverse at all costs. Mercantilist nations that have depended on increasing exports as the source of their economic growth will find markets restricted as relocalization and glocalisation become priorities. (This includes China, Germany, Japan and other export-dependent economies.)\n\n\n\nWe can foresee deals that include access to commodities, guarantees to buy sovereign bonds, opening previously closed sectors of mercantilist economies and access to direct investment, not just trade and tariffs. In other words, the fragmentation of global trade opens the door to deals brokered between individual nations, tailored to their own interests, that cover not just interests in trade per se but in securing commodities, essentials and capital flows.\n\n\n\nGlobalisation is not dead, but it is fading: 'glocalisation' is becoming the new mantra.\n\n\n\nRisk also rises when established processes break down as multiple crises emerge and reinforce each other--what's known as polycrisis. When established mechanisms no longer resolve crises or conflicts, then leaders will naturally be tempted to try ever more extreme measures to regain control (or the illusion of control).\n\n\n\nEvery leader is prone to miscalculation, but authoritarian regimes with highly concentrated nodes of decision-making are more prone to making catastrophically bad decisions because they've suppressed dissent and open debate as threats to the regime's political and narrative control.\n\n\n\nThe global trend toward authoritarianism concentrates decision-making in the hands of the few, increasing the risks of fatal misjudgments or miscalculations.\n\n\n\nAmidst a disconcertingly expanding universe of risks, Richard Bonugli and I discuss these ten which were assembled by the consortium at CedarOwl. CedarOwl's Table of Geo-Political Investor Risks. This graphic can be understood as a risk matrix. (My own list of 10 risks would be different, of course, but this is a worthy place to start.) Podcast: 10 Geopolitical / Financial Risks to the Global Economy:\n\n\n\n1. Financiers Seizing Collateral in a Derivatives Crisis, a.k.a. \"The Great Taking\"\n\n\n\n2. Cyberattacks\n\n\n\n3. Tariff wars\n\n\n\n4. Confiscation of other nation's financial assets\n\n\n\n5. Selling / Boycott of US Treasuries\n\n\n\n6. Imposition of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\n\n\n\n7.

        "title": "Fed Rate Cut Hopes Lift US Stocks Amid Mixed Data; Euro, Yen Under Pressure",
        "body": "Mood yesterday was mixed on a series of mixed economic and corporate news. In Europe, the business and consumer survey came in slightly lower than expected, the lost more than 1%, and the fell. The German stocks did better than their European peers as some big names like Siemens and SAP outperformed, while in the UK, the sank below its 50-DMA despite a softer pound and a positive breakout in oil prices.\n\nfinally cleared the critical $82pb resistance and returned to the positive trend that was building at the start of the year. The April to June selloff is fully behind us now, trend and momentum indicators remain positive while the market is not yet in the overbought territory meaning that there is room for further gains in the short run.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the outlook has improved. From a fundamental point of view, news are supportive as well. Yesterday\u2019s GDP update from the US confirmed that the US economy slowed in Q1 to grow just 1.4%, but the print was slightly better than the 1.3% expected, and down from 3.4% printed a quarter earlier. Sales and consumer spending halved, and inventories rose. Price indications were not enchanting but investors looked past these components as the uptick we saw in first quarter inflation is thought to have slowed past the Q1. All in all data was positive for the reflation trade.\n\nOther than that, the US trade deficit widened to the highest levels in 2 years, pending home sales fell 2% and the jobless claims rose to the highest levels since last summer. Data hinted at further slowdown in the US economy, but the slowdown didn\u2019t look catastrophic. As such, the data-fueled the dovish Fed expectations and boosted appetite for the US treasuries, as well, along with a strong sale of bonds, following good sales of and bonds earlier in the week.\n\nThe US 2-year yield tested but remained above the 4.70% level, the yield fluctuated near 4.30%. The and eked out small gains as Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut hopes rose, with some investors expecting up to two rate cuts from now to the end of the year, and the eased but rebounded in Asia as the presidential debate between Trump and Biden favoured - Trump.\n\nThere is one more thing to watch before this weekends: the core PCE data \u2013 the Fed\u2019s favourite gauge of inflation that\u2019s expected to show further weakness in both headline and core numbers. If that\u2019s the case, combined with yesterday\u2019s softish growth data, we could see the Fed doves remain in charge of the market. The latter could help broaden the US stock rally to non-tech sectors, and toward the reflation-friendly European markets.\n\nEuro Under Pressure\n\nSome Eurozone countries will reveal their preliminary inflation numbers for June today. Sufficiently soft data is needed to keep the European Central Bank (ECB) doves alive, but for the euro, the upcoming French election this weekend is probably more important than the inflation figures as regardless of the data \u2013 unless we see something very much unexpected \u2013 many investors will probably chose to go into the French election weekend without a positive exposure to the euro given that Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally is seen securing one vote out of three, and that\u2019s not the outcome that the market is happy with.\n\nThe spread between the French and German 10-year yield is back above 80bp and could further widen depending on the French election outcome. Higher yield differential means lower appetite for euro. It could be that a blow to Macron has already priced in (and overly priced in) and the euro could rebound in a typical \u2018buy the rumour sell the fact\u2019 move on Monday open, but volatility will likely be on the menu and the euro could \u2013 regardless of the inflation figures on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 further ease against the greenback before the weekly close. The currently trades below 1.07 mark. We could see the pair fall below the 1.0660 level \u2013 which acted as a support since Macron called for the snap election.\n\nA last word for the yen: the was trading past the 161 level this morning, with no news of intervention on the wire just yet. The yen bears are looking for the limit, while the risk of intervention grows with every pip higher.",

        "title": "S&P 500: Stocks May Attempt to Break Highs",
        "body": "Stocks didn\u2019t do much yesterday, with the closing just 0.09% higher. The market has further extended its short-term consolidation following a retreat from last Thursday\u2019s new record high of 5,505.53. Today, the index is likely to open 0.4% higher, as indicated by futures contracts. The Core PCE Price Index release has been as expected at +0.1% month over month. The S&P 500 remains relatively close to record highs, and for now, it only looks like a relatively flat correction of the uptrend.\n\nIn my forecast for June, I wrote:\n\n\u201cFor the last three months, the S&P 500 index has been fluctuating along new record highs, above the 5,000 level which was broken in February. It looks like a consolidation within a long-term uptrend, but it may also be a topping pattern before some meaningful medium-term correction. What is it likely to do? As the saying goes, 'the trend is your friend', so the most likely scenario is more advances in the future. However, a negative signal would be a breakdown below the 5,000 level. That would raise the question of a deeper correction and downward reversal. I think that the likelihood of a bullish scenario is 60/40 - a downward reversal cannot be completely ruled out. The market will be waiting for more signals from the Fed about potential interest rate easing, plus, at the end of the month, the coming earnings season may dictate the market moves.\u201d\n\nThe investor sentiment remained basically unchanged on Wednesday, as indicated by the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed that 44.5% of individual investors are bullish, while 28.3% of them are bearish (up from last week's reading of 22.5%). The AAII sentiment is a contrary indicator in the sense that highly bullish readings may suggest excessive complacency and a lack of fear in the market. Conversely, bearish readings are favorable for market upturns.\n\nThe S&P 500 index continues sideways after breaking its upward trend line, as we can see on the daily chart.\n\nNasdaq 100 Extends Its Rebound\n\nLast Thursday, the technology-focused reached a new record high of 19,979.93, before retracing the advance and closing lower. On Friday and Monday, the market traded lower, but since Tuesday, it has been rebounding, reaching as high as 19,850 yesterday. This morning, the Nasdaq 100 is poised to open 0.5% higher, getting closer to the record high from last week.\n\nVIX Gets Closer to 12\n\nThe , also known as the fear gauge, is derived from option prices. In late May, it set a new medium-term low of 11.52 before rebounding up to around 15 on correction worries. Since last Thursday, it has been closing above the 13 level, showing increasing fear in the market. Since Tuesday, the VIX is closing closed below 13 on hopes that a correction in stocks may be ending. Yesterday, it went closer to the 12 level.\n\nHistorically, a dropping VIX indicates less fear in the market, and rising VIX accompanies stock market downturns. However, the lower the VIX, the higher the probability of the market\u2019s downward reversal.\n\nFutures Contract Trades Above 5,550\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the hourly chart of the contract. Last Thursday, it reached a new high of around 5,588. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, reaching the support level at around 5,520. This morning, it is trading higher, yet still below the recent high.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe S&P 500 index is likely to open 0.3% higher today. For a few sessions, the market continued trading sideways after last Thursday\u2019s intraday retreat, and today, it may attempt to get closer to the record. The recent trading action is best described as a flat correction of the uptrend.\n\nFor now, my short-term outlook remains neutral.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nThe S&P 500 reversed lower from a new record high on Thursday; this week, it kept extending a consolidation.\n\nRecently, stock prices were reaching new record highs despite mixed data and growing uncertainty.\n\nIn my opinion, the short-term outlook is neutral.",

        "title": "AI Rally Vs. Dot-Com Crash: Here's Why History Won't Rhyme This Time",
        "body": "Don't fear the bubble talk: Data suggests the AI rally is different from the dot-com boom.\n\nMega-cap tech leads the market, but history shows this doesn't signal a crash.\n\nWhile some worry about narrow leadership, the current market performance actually aligns with history.\n\nUnlock AI-powered Stock Picks for Under $7/Month: Summer Sale Starts Now!\n\nConcerns about a market bubble often overshadow important data. Comparing Nvidia's (NASDAQ: ) position with Cisco's (NASDAQ: ) during the dotcom era provides clarity on why today\u2019s tech valuations are not as alarming.\n\nCisco's peak forward P/E ratio soared to 131 in March 2000, while Nvidia's current forward P/E stands at a much lower 45. Although Nvidia isn't cheap, its valuation is far from the extreme levels Cisco reached in 2000, and it's also well below Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) P/E in 1999.\n\nNvidia's historical performance does not imply an inevitable collapse. It's crucial to understand that Nvidia does not have to follow the same trajectory as Cisco did over two decades ago.\n\nThe comparison of their P/E ratios highlights significant differences: Nvidia and Cisco are fundamentally different companies with distinct market contexts.\n\nMega-Cap Tech Leads, But History Suggests No Crash\n\nThe focus often falls on large-cap and mega-cap tech stocks driving the current bull market. This automatically puts them on the overvalued list, right? Not necessarily.\n\nHistorically, these giants have frequently led rallies, and it doesn't signal an inevitable crash.\n\nThe data confirms this. The top 10 stocks currently trade at a P/E of 30x, compared to 47x for the top 10 in the 2000s. When you exclude the top 10, the remaining 490 stocks in the S&P 500 today trade at a P/E of 18x, versus 16x in 2000.\n\nFew Stocks Posting the Bulk of Gains: Is That Really a Concern?\n\nThere's also chatter about narrow leadership in the market. Let's delve deeper. While 8% of the S&P 500 have returned over 30% year-to-date (YTD), it's not just the usual suspects.\n\nThis impressive performance comes from a broader group of 40 stocks, not just the frequently mentioned 7.\n\nThe current 8% of S&P 500 stocks performing above 30% is actually in line with historical averages \u2013 slightly lower than the 10% average since 1990. This suggests that 2024 might be a typical year historically, and not an outlier.\n\nA Very Strong H2 2024 Lies Ahead for Stocks\n\nLast year, the S&P 500 returned almost 25%, and this year it's around +15% so far, which is notable given that election years typically see stronger performance later in the year.\n\nThe chart below shows the current trend remains above average, but it's important to consider that election years tend to be positive, with the stock market performing well from mid-May to September. Could this be a hint of a summer rally?\n\nJune might be ending with the S&P 500 close to a 4% gain. Notably, the worst day this month saw a mere 0.31% drop early in the week. Additionally, there haven't been any daily declines of 2% in quite some time.\n\nThe last time the market saw a daily drop exceeding 2% was February 2023. This translates to 338 consecutive trading days without such a decline, significantly higher than the typical 29 days.\n\nWhile this might suggest some expected volatility, it's important to keep things in perspective \u2013 the current streak is only a third of the longest ever recorded (949 days).\n\nLooking ahead, July has historically been a strong month for the S&P 500, with gains in 9 consecutive years and 11 of the last 12.\n\nOver the past 20 years, July\u2019s average return exceeds 2.5%. Given the positive trend during election years, the market could continue its uptrend through the summer months.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, get exclusive discounts on our subscriptions, including annual plans for less than $7 a month!\n\nTired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is written for informational purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation, offer, advice, counsel or recommendation to invest as such it is not intended to incentivize the purchase of assets in any way.

        "body": "Three major stocks are making waves in today's market: WBA plummets after slashing its profit outlook, MU drops despite beating earnings expectations, and PANW rises on positive analyst sentiment.\n\nIn a volatile trading session, three major stocks are capturing investors\u2019 attention with significant price movements and key announcements. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) faced a steep decline following its earnings report, while Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) saw a pullback despite beating expectations. Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ) gained on positive analyst sentiment. Here\u2019s a closer look at these stocks making waves in today\u2019s market.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Stock Plunges on Third-Quarter Earnings Report\n\nShares of Walgreens Boots Alliance plummeted 24.77% to $11.78 as of 11:30 AM EDT, following the release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. Despite beating revenue expectations with $36.4 billion against an anticipated $35.94 billion, the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 fell short of the expected $0.68.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical retailer slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook to $2.80-$2.95 per share from the previous $3.20-$3.35, citing a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.\n\nWalgreens announced plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years as part of a cost-cutting strategy. Despite challenges in its retail segment, which saw a 4% decline in sales, the company\u2019s U.S. healthcare segment grew 7.6% year-over-year to $2.13 billion.\n\n\n\nThe stock\u2019s year-to-date return stands at -53.64%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500\u2018s 14.69% gain.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Dips Despite Better than Expected Results, Fails to Impress AI-Driven Expectations\n\nMicron Technology shares dropped 6.76% to $132.73 by late morning trading, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.\n\n\n\nThe memory chip manufacturer posted earnings per share of $0.62, surpassing the projected $0.51, and revenue of $6.81 billion, exceeding the estimated $6.67 billion. However, forward guidance that merely met analyst expectations appeared to disappoint investors, especially considering the stock\u2019s strong performance leading up to earnings, having rallied over 65% year-to-date.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $157.70 billion, Micron remains a key player in the .\n\n\n\nHowever, some analysts suggest the stock may be overvalued in the short term, with an estimated fair value of $97.84, significantly below its current trading price. Despite the pullback, the average analyst price target stands at $153.08, indicating potential upside.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Stock Gains on Analyst Optimism\n\nBucking the downward trend, Palo Alto Networks saw its stock rise 5.28% to $342.42 by late morning. The cybersecurity firm continues to benefit from bullish analyst sentiment, with both Robert W. Baird and Cantor Fitzgerald analysts maintaining Buy ratings.\n\n\n\nAnalysts cite steady demand, improved visibility for the year\u2019s second half, and successful platformization strategies, particularly in Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Extended Security Information and Event Management (XSIEM).\n\nPalo Alto Networks boasts impressive growth metrics, with a year-to-date return of 16.12% and a one-year return of 40.45%, outpacing the broader market. The company\u2019s focus on high-quality, sustainable customer relationships and positive response to new AI features have contributed to its strong performance in the rapidly growing cybersecurity sector.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. prices were unchanged in May while consumer spending rose moderately, a trend that could draw the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting interest rates this year.\n\nThe flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures(PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain inApril, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysissaid on Friday. In the 12 months through May, the PCE priceindex increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE priceindex unchanged on the month and rising 2.6% year-on-year.\n\nMARKET REACTIONS:\n\nSTOCKS: U.S. stock futures were little changed after the report, up 0.3%BONDS: Benchmark 10-year yields were down three basis points to about 4.27%; Two-year yields fell four points to 4.69%.FOREX: The U.S. dollar extended losses against the yen and was last down 0.2% at 160.53 yen\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, B RILEY WEALTH, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cWhen you compare what we got today with expectations, it is very much in-line and so, the Fed will likely have enough comfort by the time of the September 18th meeting to cut rates for the first time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is notable is that the Fed had pencilled in 2.6% core PCE by the end of 2024, and it looks like we're already there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you looking for a reaction to the data, the key place to look for a reaction to this core PCE at 2.6% clearly is an ongoing downdraft in treasury yields and that's unambiguously good for equities.\"\n\nPETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cPersonal income came in a little bit higher than expected, but spending obviously was lower and that's key for the Fed, indicating lower inflation.\u201d\n\n\"The (price index) numbers were good\u2014in line with expectations. This is good news. It shows that shows that inflation has peaked and is moving in the right direction. The question is \u2018will the feds begin to change their tune on lowering rates?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that they're going to want to see more evidence, but it\u2019s becoming clearer that inflation has peaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get one more month of inflation ticking down, that opens the door for a rate cut in September despite the hardline stance taken by many Fed members.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think inflation going to get down to 2% this year. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Fed cannot cut rates or loosen monetary policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the chances of sending the economy in a recession in the early part of 2025 becomes, increasingly, more of a possibility.\u201d\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN\n\n\u201cAfter basically going nowhere for a year, real disposable personal income finally popped higher. I doubt that signals a change in the trend, though. Spending was nothing to write home about. Even Food service and accommodations had a dip in spending.\n\n\"Slower inflation is helping a bit. Lower inflation doesn\u2019t mean lower prices, it just means they stop rising so quickly. There is deflation in goods prices with the goods price deflator down 0.1% from a year ago. Services inflation came in at 3.9% year-over-year, which is about where it\u2019s been stuck since December. The Fed will see in this data what it wants to see and that\u2019s going to keep everyone guessing as to when the next cut will be.\u201d\n\nJAY WOODS, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, FREEDOM CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK\n\n\"This is a perfect report - it gives the Fed the green light to cut in September, and sets the stage for the dovish rhetoric to continue, which we will hopefully hear in the July meeting. It shows the Fed measures are working and keeps a soft landing still on table. Of course, there's a lot of data between now and September but it hits all the chords for the Fed looking to cut.\n\n\"The is on track to open at an all time high. I'd also watch the small cap index today, if that rallies strongly that'll be a tell on how the market has taken this.\"\n\nCHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, N.C.\n\n\"This morning's data was almost perfectly in line with consensus. You're not going to learn a lot from the report. The inflation rate is slowing. The last reading that we saw, year over year was 2.7%. It's now come down to 2.6%. So the data is headed in the right direction. The rate of inflation does appear to be slowing so the Fed is going to be happy with this report, but I'm sure they're looking for more they want certainty that we're going to head to the 2% target. Even though we're headed in the right direction, we're not getting there very quickly. Its just decelerating at a much slower pace.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there's enough in this report to get them ready to cut rates. But there's nothing in this report that should keep them concerned. And so that's a difference from earlier this year.\"\n\nThis report doesn't really give us any new information. It's more a status quo. We still think the fed will cut rates once this year and they'll do it in December, more because they want to cut rates than that they need to cut rates.\"\n\n\"If a car is slowing down from 60 miles an hour to 30 miles an hour, when it goes from 60 to 40 you notice it but when it goes from 33 to 31, it's just not very exciting.\"\n\nCAROL SCHLEIF, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BMO FAMILY OFFICE, MINNEAPOLIS\n\n\u201cMarkets will breathe the sigh of relief that the PCE didn\u2019t really surprise one way or the other. It's still indicative of an economy that's coasting, hopefully to a more sustainable long term pace, with inflation still bumping its way downward\u201d",

The AI boom on Wall Street has helped the rocket nearly 15% over the past six months, with hefty gains in Europe and Asia, too.\n\nHowever, worries about the outcome of the two-stage French parliamentary elections that start on Sunday pushed the risk premium on French government bonds over German bonds to its widest since the euro zone debt crisis in 2012.\n\nThe political uncertainty in France, where the far right is leading, put the euro on course for its biggest monthly fall since January.\n\nThe MSCI All Country Stock Index was firmer at 804 points, near its June 20 lifetime high of 807.17, and up about 10.5% for the year.\n\nIn Europe, the STOXX index of 600 companies was little changed, cementing its 7% gain for the year, though down this month as French political uncertainty weighs.\n\nEren Osman, wealth management director at Arbuthnot Latham, said the stock market advance underpinned by tech majors and AI shares should continue to drive stocks into the second half.\n\n\"What we see is just a very clear narrative that the investment in that space is not going to slow down any time in the near term, so to bet against that as a theme and likely strong equity market performance is probably not a wise move,\" Osman said.\n\nFRAGMENTATION\n\nThere was a muted response from the dollar and U.S. stock index futures to the U.S. presidential debate in which Democrat President Joe Biden stumble at times in a head-to-head with Republican rival Donald Trump ahead of the November election.\n\n\"We see a potential Trump administration as more positive for the dollar, both via looser fiscal policy and also via a more aggressive trade/tariff environment,\" ING analysts said after the debate.\n\nHSBC economist Paul Bloxham said commodity markets face greater fragmentation and supply disruptions if Trump wins in November because that would be expected to prompt a rise in trade protectionism.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 0.2% and was on track to gain more than 3% for the month - its best performance since February.\n\nChinese markets, meanwhile, reversed early losses to trade higher, with China's benchmark CSI300 last up 0.2% and Hong Kong's up 0.56%. Investors had been concerned that Biden and Trump could tip a harder stance on China during their debate.\n\nIn currency markets, the dollar was heading for a monthly gain of nearly 1.4% against a basket of currencies.\n\nThe yen tumbled to a trough of 161.27 per dollar, its weakest since 1986, and was last trading at 160.555.\n\nThe Japanese currency has fallen 2.3% this month and more than 12% this year against a resilient dollar and continues to be hammered by stark interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan.\n\nThe yen's weakness, meanwhile, has been a boon for the , which was last up 0.6% and heading towards a monthly gain of about 3%.\n\nIn commodity markets, gold was a touch firmer at$2,336 an ounce.

The greenback, however, edged higher to trade flat on the day, with investors still focused on the wide interest rate differential between the United States and Japan.\n\nThe dollar was last up slightly against the Japanese unit at 160.815 yen, after earlier hitting a 38-year high of 161.27 yen. Traders remained on high alert for intervention from Japanese authorities to boost its currency.\n\nThe U.S. currency has posted monthly and quarterly gains versus the yen of about 1.9% and 5.9%, respectively.\n\nData showed the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, was unchanged last month, and followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, data showed. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April.\n\n\"The PCE report was mostly in line with expectations, which confirms the disinflationary trend as shown by the CPI (consumer price index), PPI (producer price index) numbers earlier this month,\" said Boris Kovacevic, global macro strategist at Convera in Vienna, Austria. \"The macro data continues to point to a softening of the U.S. economy.\"\n\nFollowing the inflation data, fed funds futures slightly raised the chances of easing in September to around 67%, from about 65% late Thursday, according to LSEG calculations. The market is also pricing between one to two rate cuts of 25 bps each this year.\n\nA separate report on Thursday showed business activity in the Midwest came in better than expected, modestly helping the dollar. The Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 47.4 from 35 in May, and better than the 40 that economists projected.\n\nUniversity of Michigan consumer sentiment, meanwhile, showed a reading of a better-than-expected 68.2 for June, also dollar-supportive. In addition, respondents to the sentiment survey expect near- and long-term inflation expectations to level out at 3%.\n\nInvestors will now focus on next week's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, in which Wall Street economists are forecasting a gain of 195,000 in June, compared with 272,000 in May.\n\n\"Next week\u2019s employment report will give us the opportunity to see if the job market is slowing,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth, in emailed comments.\n\n\"This number will have to be a big surprise to the downside to suggest the Fed will act in July to lower rates. We expect the Fed to stay pat unless the job market starts to falter.\"\n\nIn other currencies, the euro was up 0.1% at $1.0709 .\n\nThe euro, down 1.3% against the dollar in June, was on track for its biggest monthly fall since January as political uncertainty weighed in the run-up to France's general elections.\n\nFor the second quarter, Europe's single currency fell 0.7%.\n\nInvestors fear a new French government could increase fiscal spending, threatening the sustainability of the country's public debt and the financial stability of the bloc.\n\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar was little changed at 0.8986 francs.\n\nAside from the economic data, market participants were also focused on U.S. politics.\n\nRepublican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of at-times false attacks on President Joe Biden in their first campaign debate in Atlanta, with the dollar rising as Biden stumbled over his words a few times in early exchanges.\n\nThe debate increased the odds of a Trump presidency and the imposition of import tariffs. Traders bought dollars overall as a Trump administration suggests more aggressive tariffs that could be inflationary and could trigger higher interest rates.\n\nCurrency\n\nbid\n\nprices at\n\n28 June\u200b\n\n04:28\n\np.m. GMT\n\nDescripti RIC Last U.S. Pct YTD Pct High Low\n\non Close Change Bid Bid\n\nPrevious\n\nSession\n\nDollar 105.79 105.89 -0.08% 4.36% 106.13 105.\n\nindex 78\n\nEuro/Doll 1.072 1.0704 0.15% -2.88% $1.0722 $1.0\n\nar 685\n\nDollar/Ye 160.84 160.81 0.02% 14.03% 161.27 160.\n\nn 305\n\nEuro/Yen 1.072\u200b 172.06 0.22% 10.79% 172.44 171.\n\n46\n\nDollar/Sw 0.8985 0.8988 -0.03% 6.76% 0.901 0.89\n\niss 8\n\nSterling/ 1.2645 1.2639 0.06% -0.62% $1.267 $1.0\n\nDollar 685\u200b\n\nDollar/Ca 1.368 1.3701 -0.14% 3.21% 1.3734 1.36\n\nnadian 76\n\nAussie/Do 0.6674 0.6648 0.4% -2.11% $0.6685 $0.6\n\nllar 62\n\nEuro/Swis 0.9629 0.9617 0.12% 3.69% 0.9639 0.96\n\ns 1\n\nEuro/Ster 0.8474 0.8468 0.07% -2.24% 0.8481 0.84\n\nling 58\n\nNZ 0.6095 0.6083 0.19% -3.55% $0.6101 0.60\n\nDollar/Do 58\n\nllar\n\nDollar/No 10.6637\u200b 10.6221 0.39% 5.22% 10.6948 10.6\n\nrway 116\n\nEuro/Norw 11.4325 11.3732 0.52% 1.86% 11.4347 11.3\n\nay 67\n\nDollar/Sw 10.5942 10.6226 -0.27% 5.24% 10.6618 10.5\n\neden 83\n\nEuro/Swed 11.3586 11.3755 -0.15% 2.1% 11.4033 11.3\n\nen 364",

        "title": "US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut By Reuters",
        "body": "By Lucia Mutikani\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly inflation was unchanged in May as a modest increase in the cost of services was offset by the largest drop in goods prices in six months, drawing the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting interest rates later this year.\n\nThe report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed consumer spending rose marginally last month. Underlying prices advanced at the slowest pace in six months, raising optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a much-desired \"soft landing\" for the economy in which inflation cools without triggering a recession and a sharp rise in unemployment.\n\nTraders raised their bets for a Fed rate cut in September.\n\n\"This was a very Fed-friendly report that should keep the September rate cut in play, while at the same time increasing investor confidence that moderate economic growth can be maintained even as rates stay higher for longer,\" said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. \"The sharp slowdown in core inflation is just what the doctor needed to see to keep the economy on the soft-landing glide-path.\"\n\nThe flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. It was the first time in six months that PCE inflation was unchanged. Goods prices fell 0.4%, the biggest drop since November.\n\nThere were big declines in prices of recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment.\n\nThe price of gasoline and other energy goods dropped 3.4%, the biggest slide in six months. Clothing and footwear were also cheaper, while food prices rose marginally.\n\nThe cost of services increased 0.2%, lifted by higher prices for housing and utilities as well as healthcare. Financial services and insurance costs declined 0.3% after rising for five straight months. These costs, together with housing, have been among the major drivers of services inflation.\n\nIn the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations.\n\nInflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the central bank's 2% target.\n\nFinancial markets saw a roughly 68% chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September compared to about 64% before the data, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The U.S. central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July.\n\nEconomists were divided on whether the Fed would still reduce borrowing costs twice this year amid solid wage growth. The release of the U.S. employment report for June next Friday could shed more light on the monetary policy outlook.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.\n\nSPENDING RISES MODERATELY\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since November. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in April.\n\nThe so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have climbed 0.2% in April. Core inflation increased 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8% in April.\n\nIt rose at a 2.7% annualized rate over the past three months, slowing from a 3.5% pace in April.\n\nThe Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target.\n\nPCE services inflation excluding energy and housing also ticked up 0.1% last month after advancing 0.3% in April. This measure is being watched by policymakers to measure progress in lowering price pressures.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in April, the report also showed. Spending was supported by a 0.3% gain in services, mostly outlays on hospital care, housing and utilities as well as air transportation. Services spending increased 0.4% in April.\n\nGoods spending rebounded 0.2%, lifted by outlays on prescription medication, recreational goods and vehicles, and clothing and footwear. Spending on goods fell 0.5% in April.\n\nInflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs as well as the exhaustion of excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are holding back spending. Nonetheless, consumer spending remains underpinned by a resilient labor market, which continues to generate strong wage gains. Personal income increased 0.5% after climbing 0.3% in April. Wages shot up 0.7%, which some economists said could concern policymakers.\n\nIncome at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose a solid 0.5%. Consumers saved more, lifting the saving rate to 3.9% from 3.7% in April.\n\nSpending adjusted for inflation rebounded 0.3% after slipping 0.1% in April. The rise in the so-called real consumer spending left growth in consumption this quarter on track to match the first quarter's 1.5% pace.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed is currently estimating gross domestic product to rise at a 2.2% rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4% pace in the first quarter.\n\n\"There was no inflation in May, but there was also no indication of the kind of soft demand - undermined by slower income growth - the Fed believes necessary to keep inflation on a low track,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial.",

        "body": "By Ross Kerber and Suzanne McGee\n\nCHICAGO (Reuters) - The spread of artificial intelligence-based systems offers big opportunities for financial services firms, executives say, but asset managers also face higher stakes than other consumer-facing businesses because they manage sensitive information.\n\nFor example, AI systems could be better than humans at explaining to clients why they arrived at recommendations like portfolio allocations or lending decisions, said Zack Kass, a former head of business partnerships at OpenAI. People, he said, are not good at explaining subconscious biases that could affect such decisions.\n\n\"AI should make that a ton better. The problem is, if we're not careful, it will just make it worse,\" Kass said at an investor conference staged by Morningstar this week in Chicago where the rise of AI systems was a frequent topic of discussion.\n\nIn theory AI, will simplify many routine tasks like filling out compliance forms or developing portfolios that are not so complex, leaving financial professionals more time to focus on human interactions or problems that require deeper thinking, said several investors and technology experts.\n\n\"There are some things that the machines could smooth over, and then a financial adviser could spend more time servicing their client,\" said Karen Zaya, a Morningstar senior research analyst who follows investment managers' use of technology.\n\nBut the depth of human interactions with AI will vary, she said. While AI-powered chatbots have become common for tasks like helping to choose an airline seat or to check a bank account balance, she said, the variables are much more complex for things like arranging investments in a retirement plan.\n\n\"I don't think that's on the agenda for the industry right now,\" Zaya said. \"All these firms we've spoken with are being very thoughtful and careful in how they implement these things. They want to be very considered.\"\n\nU.S. regulators are seeking public comments about the use of AI by financial companies, looking to promote inclusive and equitable access to their services. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned this month that the use of AI in finance could lower transaction costs but comes with \"significant risks.\"\n\nThe spread of AI could tempt companies to cut jobs in areas such as at call centers or in software-development facilities, but it is still likely they will need human workers to handle more complex questions, said Margaret Vitrano, portfolio manager for ClearBridge Investments.\n\n\"AI could be used to develop code, but that doesn't mean you lay off all your developers. Maybe you use it to develop the first pass of code, and then you still need someone who's sophisticated and knows code to look at it and say, let's think about the user experience here,\" Vitrano said.\n\nBrenda Ingram, a Chicago-based financial adviser, said she hopes AI systems could save time and expenses on preparing things like compliance reports.\n\n\"The mundane, if you can get the AI to do it, I think we're going to like it,\" she said.",

        "body": "Investing.com - BofA Securities has highlighted Lamborghini as an important yet undervalued asset within the Volkswagen (ETR: ) Group in a research study. The report, titled \"Postcard from Italy: A day at Lamborghini, the hidden gem within the Audi Group,\" points to Lamborghini's strong financial performance, parallels with Ferrari (NYSE: ), and the strategic significance of the company for VW, which, however, is not reflected in the current corporate value.\n\nMega Summer Deal : Take advantage of our unbeatable summer offer and get up to 60% off with the coupon code PROTRADER .

CLICK HERE and get started today !\n\nLamborghini, now consolidated under the Audi Group, achieved an EBIT margin of 27% in 2023 with sales of around 10,000 units - a performance that is \"not far from Ferrari,\" according to the US bank's experts. The total revenue of the luxury car manufacturer amounted to \u20ac2.7 billion last year, based on an average revenue per unit of \u20ac263,000, mainly driven by the models Urus, Huracan, and the newly introduced Revuelto.\n\nThe report attributes Lamborghini's success primarily to its residual value-based business model. \"The business is driven by residual values, which remain above new car prices even three years after sale,\" said BofA. This strategy largely aligns with Ferrari's and creates scarcity and high demand for Lamborghini vehicles, which are often sold above the new price in the first three years.\n\nBofA predicts a significant increase in revenue and profitability for Lamborghini through its ongoing hybridization strategy. By 2025, the entire fleet is expected to be electrified, reducing the Urus' CO2 emissions by 80% and increasing the revenue per unit, according to the experts. The price for the Revuelto is expected to rise to \u20ac500,000, with similar price increases for the Urus and Huracan models.\n\nDespite Lamborghini's robust finances, BofA argues that Lamborghini's value is not fully reflected in VW's current stock price. The analysts suggest a valuation of Lamborghini between \u20ac15 billion and \u20ac20 billion, which would add an extra \u20ac30 to \u20ac40 per VW share. This valuation could reach up to \u20ac35 billion (\u20ac70 per VW share) if Lamborghini is equated with Ferrari.\n\nReferring to Lamborghini's hidden value and the potential for significant returns for shareholders, BofA maintains its buy recommendation for VW's common and preferred shares. Although the investment bank does not anticipate a short-term IPO for Lamborghini, it emphasizes Lamborghini's long-term value to the VW Group. Accordingly, the US bank's price target for Volkswagen preferred shares is \u20ac145, representing a potential return of over 37% based on the current price.\n\nNote: Start a new era of investing with InvestingPro and gain access to a comprehensive set of tools that will enhance your investment strategy:\n\nProPicks : Rely on AI-driven stock strategies with proven success.

The Howard G. Buffett Foundation works to alleviate hunger, mitigate conflicts including in Ukraine, and improve public safety. The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska nonprofits, and the NoVo Foundation has initiatives focused on girls and women.\n\nFriday's filing suggests based on Buffett's holdings that Berkshire has repurchased little or none of its own stock since April 19.",

He also highlighted the urgency created by the upcoming end-of-support dates in 2027 and 2030, which is pushing customers to proceed with transitions despite economic uncertainties.\n\nThe analyst detailed SAP's strategy to leverage its extensive maintenance stream and transition to the S/4HANA Cloud. Bachman forecasts that if SAP's consolidated revenues grow by 9% annually in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 and by 7% until 2030, this could lead to new revenues of \u20ac23.7 billion compared to 2023. A significant portion of this growth is expected from the transition of 60% of the 2023 maintenance base to a 2.5x revenue growth, accounting for about 45% of the projected new revenues by 2030.\n\nThe analyst also noted some successes in acquiring new customers, particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment through SAP's GROW and RISE programs. Although the revenue contribution from these new customers is expected to be modest, it is seen as beneficial for SAP's overall valuation.\n\nBachman expressed confidence in the sustainable growth of SAP's cloud offerings. \"We believe that SAP can maintain mid-to-high double-digit growth in the current cloud order book and low 30% growth in the cloud ERP order book,\" he said. Additionally, BMO remains optimistic that SAP will achieve the consensus target of \u20ac8 billion in free cash flow (FCF) by fiscal year 2025.\n\nNote: Start a new era of investing with InvestingPro and gain access to a comprehensive set of tools to improve your investment strategy:\n\nProPicks : Bet on AI-driven stock strategies with proven success.

Southwest said it is engaged with the National Transportation Safety Board and FAA to understand the circumstances of the departure. After the incident the plane continued safely to Baltimore, Southwest said.\n\nSeveral other incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns.\n\nLast week, the FAA said it was investigating a Southwest flight that descended to a low altitude of around 500 feet (152.4 m) about 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport.\n\nAfter the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas.\n\nEarlier this month, the FAA and NTSB said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a \"Dutch roll\" at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.\n\nThe FAA said this month it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport.\n\nDuring the go-around, the first officer \"inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,\" according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.\n\nSouthwest said the incident prompted the airline to review data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.",

Analysts believe that AMD will continue to improve its market position by offering better performance at competitive pricing, similar to its strategy in the compute server and PC markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel (NASDAQ: ) is expected to ramp up shipments of its Granite Rapids in the first quarter of 2025, although there are concerns about potential delays and competition from AMD. Mizuho's experts see Intel focusing on increasing core count and performance to regain market share in the server market.\n\nMizuho also highlighted strong pricing trends in the DRAM and HDD/SSD markets, which are expected to continue into the second half of 2024.\n\n\u201cOur call also noted DRAM could see 5-10% price increases into the JunQ, with further increases into 2H24E.

        "title": "UK economy picks up in early 2024, too late for election boost By Reuters",
        "body": "By David Milliken\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy pulled out of recession at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of this year, revised official data showed on Friday, but the broader economic backdrop remains fragile ahead of next week's election.\n\nBritish gross domestic product expanded by 0.7% from the previous quarter, above an initial estimate of 0.6% growth, the Office for National Statistics said. GDP fell for two quarters in a row in the second half of 2023.\n\nThe figures come less than a week before Britons vote in an election that opinion polls suggest the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, looks set to win comfortably over the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe longer-term growth picture is weak, contributing to Sunak's electoral difficulties. First-quarter gross domestic product was just 0.3% higher than a year earlier, above an initial estimate of 0.2%.\n\nReal household disposable income - a measure of living standards - was 0.6% lower per head in the first quarter of 2024 than it was in the final quarter of 2019, the time of Britain's last national election and just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Income growth over the parliament so far has been worse than in any other since the 1950s, and the third worst in post-Edwardian Britain,\" said Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, referring to the period since 1910.\n\n\"Addressing this great living standards slowdown is the ultimate test for whomever wins the election,\" he added.\n\nBritain's economy has struggled since its last election, hurt not just by the pandemic - which dealt a lasting blow to the labour force - but also by a surge in inflation after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and post-Brexit trade frictions.\n\nBritain's economy in the first quarter of 2024 was 1.8% larger than in the final quarter of 2019, the weakest performer after Germany among the world's seven largest advanced economies - though neither France nor Japan have done much better.\n\nSOLID START TO 2024, TOUGHER OUTLOOK\n\nBritain's growth in the first quarter was its fastest since the final quarter of 2021 and the second quarter looks solid too. Last week the Bank of England estimated GDP would expand by 0.5% in the April-to-June period.\n\nThere was some relief for households in Friday's data. Real household disposable income per head has risen by 2.4% over the past year, helped by unusually fast wage growth as employers scramble to hire and retain staff amid a shortage of candidates.\n\nGDP per head, a longer-term driver of living standards, increased on a quarterly basis for the first time in two years - although it remains 0.6% lower than a year ago.\n\nHowever, the BoE regards robust first-half growth as likely to be a rebound from last year's weakness rather than the start of a period of strong growth, and it thinks the underlying rate of expansion in the economy is somewhere around 0.25% a quarter.\n\nThe government's budget forecasters have a higher growth outlook than most analysts. In March, they predicted annual growth would pick up from 0.8% this year to just under 2% over the coming years.\n\nLabour's Starmer has said even this relatively high estimate is too pessimistic and that he will ensure Britain has the highest sustained growth in the G7 with reforms including an easing of planning controls to speed up the building of infrastructure and 1.5 million new homes.\n\nBritain has not grown faster than 2% a year on a regular basis since before the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nEconomists view this as reflecting a slowdown in the growth rate of output per hour worked - also known as productivity - which happened in many Western economies but especially in Britain, due in part to weak investment.\n\nData from the ONS published on Friday showed total foreign direct investment in Britain fell for the fifth quarter out of the last six in the January-to-March period.",

        "body": "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\n\n22 hours ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \"a monster\" and that he was \"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

        "title": "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early",
        "body": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n23 hours ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",

        "title": "Why the Fed must change how it targets inflation",
        "body": "Print this page\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s influence on global capital flows, asset prices, and currencies dwarfs any other monetary policymaker. That\u2019s why its interest rate-setting framework matters more than most.\n\nThis cycle has, however, highlighted a few flaws in the Fed\u2019s approach. So, ahead of its inevitable post-cycle postmortem, FT Alphaville wanted to lay out some considerations for reform.\n\nFirst, a refresher:\n\n- In America, financial markets and politicians focus on the Consumer Price Index. That is because things like inflation-indexed bonds and Social Security payments are linked to it. The Fed, however, targets 2 per cent annual growth in the Personal Consumption Expenditure measure.\n\n- The Fed switched to focusing on PCE inflation in 1996 under then Chair Alan Greenspan, after a commission had found that CPI had overstated inflation by an average of 1.1 percentage points per year. (More on PCE vs CPI, here.)\n\n- Both include a measure for owner-occupied housing costs, a proxy for how much homeowners would pay for the shelter of their home, known as \u201cowner equivalent rents\u201d. It accounts for over one-third of core CPI, and is also included in the PCE, with a lower weighting. It\u2019s an imputed measure, estimated using comparable rents.\n\n- In Europe attention is narrowed upon a single inflation number, the internationally recognised Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (though there are differences). This excludes owner-equivalent costs entirely, although Britain and the Eurozone still track it in auxiliary indices. Based on HICP, American inflation is running below the Eurozone and Britain \u2014 and below target.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? FTAV reckons there are three.\n\nFirst is the inclusion of a dubious estimate of OER in US CPI and PCE. \u201cThe problem with OER is that it is a price that no one actually pays,\u201d says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. He notes three particular problems with how it\u2019s estimated:\n\n\u201cThe US rental market is small. That means small changes in demand for rental property will change market rents \u2014 which should be captured in CPI \u2014 but these will then be magnified as the rental changes are used to calculate OER.\u201d Indeed, the rental equivalent approach is problematic when the cost of homeowning (most Americans are on lower, locked-in fixed rates or don\u2019t have a mortgage) diverges from rents (which have soared).\n\n\u201cThe rents used to calculate OER are measured by a survey of just 7,800 housing units, and the response rate has fallen from nearly 70 per cent ten years ago to 56.5 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe universe of properties available to rent is unlikely to match the universe of properties available to buy, especially in a specific neighbourhood, requiring a lot of guesswork.\u201d\n\nSo, calculating OER involves a lot of conjecture. That is not unique; several components of the CPI and PCE are estimated in odd ways. The problem is OER\u2019s strong weighting.\n\nOER also lags market rents. It\u2019s estimated using both existing rental contracts and new ones. Fair. Not everyone\u2019s rent rises at the same time. But, right now OER is central to the headline stickiness in US inflation, and therefore Fed policy. That is partly because it still reflects the lagged surge in rents that came in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nChair Jay Powell knows this. At June\u2019s post-Fed meeting press conference, he said \u201cit may take several years\u201d for pandemic-era rent increases to work their way into the CPI.\n\nOER is not the only factor influencing Fed rates. But most price pressures are generally on a downward trend, and OER should also pull down, as per its lag. Taking into account the lags in how interest rates cuts also hit the economy, Powell has previously reiterated that the Fed will need to cut rates before the 2 per cent target is reached. So why isn\u2019t he cutting?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that his touting of \u201cdata dependency\u201d may have trapped him. This cycle has been characterised by an almost Pavlovian market response to CPI prints. If data comes in above expectations, markets price out and push back the cutting cycle, thereby raising the stakes for the Fed to go against the market.\n\nBut that binary analysis overlooks the reasons for why expectations were not met, or why inflation remains sticky. And as FTAV has previously shown, a lot of the stickiness is driven by the flawed inclusion of OER.\n\nThat leads us nicely to the second flaw: Two main measures add to confusion and volatility.\n\nWith its two-week release ahead of the PCE, the CPI has remained an important leading trading point for investors seeking to position early on rates. As the CPI and PCE have tended to move together, this has not been a problem.\n\nBut, right now the wedge between the two has grown to a multiyear high, which makes the read across difficult. The main differences come down to their coverage, weights, and formulas. The lack of clarity on what inflation actually is, has become a recipe for skittish market pricing. (A considerable part of that comes from the weighting differences given to OER).\n\n\u201cOne of Powell\u2019s several policy errors was that he elevated the importance of CPI as a measure back in mid 2022,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cHaving done so, it is difficult to be cutting rates when headline CPI is above 3 per cent.\u201d Both cannot fit into a 2 per cent price target framework.\n\nThird, is the risk of measurement-led divergence in rate cycles between the US and Europe.\n\nThere are a number of differences between US CPI and PCE and the Eurozone HICP and UK CPI. Different countries\u2019 consumers buy different things \u2014 baskets, weights and even tax treatments are different. That means there will always be some element of apples and oranges when comparing cross-border inflation measures.\n\n\u201cI think it is a plus if global central banks are targeting similar inflation measures,\u201d says Mark Zandi, chief economist and Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cthus reducing potential divergences in monetary policy due simply to measurement differences.\u201d\n\nBut in cycles when elements of those differences are exacerbated, in this case by housing and rental shortages driven by the pandemic, they can become drivers of divergence in rate policy. In that case, a statistical quirk can in theory determine real economic variables such as exchange rates and capital flows.\n\nSince the major central banks target 2 per cent inflation, if one measure gets psychologically closer to that number, it impacts market and policy actions (over and above the actual inflation dynamics). Indeed, the ECB has already made its first cut, and the BoE is contemplating it.\n\nResearch by Christopher Cotton, an economist at Boston Fed, underscores that dynamic. He assessed the implication of lagged market rents feeding into the headline US CPI component.\n\n\u201cI estimate that from June 2024 to June 2025, based on the current difference between market rent and CPI shelter and the pace at which the two converge in the post-pandemic period, CPI shelter will grow 1.6 percentage points more than it would if there were no such gap,\u201d he notes. As rents feed in OER too, it adds to the Fed\u2019s challenge of returning inflation to 2 per cent.\n\nUS and Europe: Rough weights for rental inflation Component: US PCE US CPI UK CPI EU HICP Rent 3.5 7.6 7.8 5.6 OER 11.9 26.7 0 0\n\nZandi has even argued that high interest rates have made new house building difficult and homeowners reluctant to give up lower locked-in rates by selling their homes. That then raises the cost of renting, which boosts inflation, and then creates a motive to keep rates higher for longer . . .\n\nSo, what are the solutions?\n\nFirst, some caveats. Rethinking how the Fed targets its inflation goal is not about shifting the goalposts to suit its agenda. It\u2019s a matter of sound interest rate setting, after the problems highlighted by this cycle above.\n\nSecond, no inflation measure is perfect. The exclusion of OER in the Europe headline measures does not make it better. A home provides a service (shelter), and that should be included in consumer prices, as it impacts standards of living. The debate is around how it\u2019s approximated.\n\nThird, changing tact on monetary policy mid-cycle is a recipe for losing credibility. So, these are options the Fed should mostly contemplate after this cycle.\n\n- A better communication strategy: A central banker saying they are \u201cdata dependent\u201d is a bit like a taste tester saying they will be led by taste. What matters are the specifics, and how things are communicated. Rather than encouraging an unrelenting static focus on how far CPI or PCE is from 2 per cent, the Fed needs to encourage a dynamic, forward-looking approach. That means articulating how it sees certain measures evolving and what it is and isn\u2019t willing to \u201clook through\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think that the Fed should very explicitly say that understanding something as complex as inflation in somewhere as complex as the US economy requires a range of measures and sub measures,\u201d says Donovan. So, still data-dependent but a broader conversation that does not attempt to give the market (or journalists) a yes/no answer, but focuses on trends.\n\n- A clearer primary focus: Powell has made clear that the Fed targets PCE, but could do more to de-emphasise CPI, or at least clarify how the central bank treats developments in CPI. \u201cThe CPI is designed to track the cost of living, its primary use is to index things like social security payments. It isn\u2019t primarily designed to be a monetary policy tool\u201d says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\n- Remove OER from the headline measure: A radical option is for the US to shift entirely to the internationally recognised HICP methodology. That may boost comparability, but HICP is not without its flaws \u2014 plus US CPI, which is closer to HICP, is not what the Fed wants to focus on. So, while question marks remain over the measure of OER, perhaps the Fed ought to focus on targeting PCE ex OER. OER can meanwhile continue to be monitored, as it is in Europe.\n\n- Improving the OER measure: Clearly the OER methodology could do with investment. It\u2019s worth developing a better understanding of how to survey and approximate owner-equivalent costs (perhaps in collaboration with international central banks) before returning to a decision of reincorporating it into the headline measure.\n\nThe last proper review of how the US measures inflation was in the Greenspan era in the 1990s. It\u2019s certainly time for another one. And it\u2019s worth doing it before any broader review on the validity of a 2 per cent target.",

Still, the Ryanair CEO can at least comfort himself with an increased multi-million dollar pay packet in the meantime.\n\nThe 63-year-old Ryanair boss\u2019s pay deal jumped to \u20ac4.7 million ($5 million) this year due to an improved base salary and rising profits at his budget airline.\n\nRyanair\u2019s latest annual results show O\u2019Leary\u2019s base salary rose to \u20ac1.2 million ($1.3 million) in 2024, while his maximum bonus fell to 50% of his annual salary, down from 100% last year. The switch is part of an updated contract that is set until 2028.\n\nThat agreement landed O\u2019Leary a \u20ac590,000 bonus and \u20ac2.89 million from a non-cash, technical accounting charge.\n\nThe airline\u2019s profits rose to \u20ac1.92 billion ($2.06 billion) last year, a 45.8% jump from 2023. Revenues were up to \u20ac13.4 billion ($14.4 billion).\n\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s pay deal\n\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s salary has been a hot topic in the CEO compensation space. He will bag a \u20ac100 million ($108 million) bonus if Ryanair\u2019s shares stay above \u20ac21 for 28 consecutive days.\n\nThe group\u2019s share price briefly floated above that magic number in April but has since declined and stands at around \u20ac16.50 as of June 28. O\u2019Leary can also secure the bumper bonus if Ryanair\u2019s profits exceed \u20ac2.2 billion.\n\nThe outspoken airline CEO has defended his salary in the past, comparing uproar over pay with the deals enjoyed by Manchester City\u2019s and Liverpool\u2019s managers in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cFootballers are getting half a million a week. Pep, who I think is a genius and deserves every penny, is getting \u00a325 million a year, Klopp too\u2014and nobody says boo,\u201d O\u2019Leary told the Telegraph in April. \u201cYet some guy running a serious business employing 20,000-plus people gets paid \u00a35 million or \u00a310 million, and it\u2019s suddenly excessive.\u201d\n\nSpeculation over O\u2019Leary\u2019s pay packet is perhaps so hot because his competitors\u2019 bosses are much less likely to enjoy similar rewards soon. Shares at EasyJet have plunged in the last 12 months, while Ryanair has risen following increased bookings.\n\nWizz Air CEO Jozsef V\u00e1radi also defended his prospective $127 million bonus cap in May, saying he wouldn\u2019t be the only person who would benefit from performance-related remuneration. He name-checked other executives and his employees as potential beneficiaries.\n\nV\u00e1radi decried his decision to lay off 20% of his workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it hit staff morale and led to a struggle to recruit as demand returned to the aviation industry.\n\nShares in Wizz Air have declined 20% in the last year.",

        "title": "Nvidia: Data Center Dominance Has Only Just Begun (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "body": "LauriPatterson/iStock via Getty Images\n\nOver the past several years, the rise of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been one of the most significant financial representations of the artificial intelligence gold rush. With the benefits of AI espoused far and wide, it comes as no surprise that the largest manufacturer of data center chipsets is benefiting symmetrically. No piece of NVDA\u2019s story was more impressive than last week, when NVDA briefly became the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAs NVDA surges past the largest businesses in the world, including Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), the company\u2019s success comes under increasing scrutiny as the valuation balloons. Behind the company\u2019s obvious dominance as the world\u2019s largest producer of critical chipsets for next-generation computing is a critical piece of global AI infrastructure. Looking to the future ahead, NVDA\u2019s rapidly expanding business has begun to segment into different verticals, led by the data center enterprise.\n\nThe company\u2019s data center business grew 409% year over year in the final quarter of last year. Quickly, data centers have become NVDA\u2019s largest business unit as the growth of AI creates an unprecedented demand wave for GPUs. Today, we will explore NVDA\u2019s data center business in greater depth and explain why new development and forecasted growth in power demand will benefit the chipmaker.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center Business\n\nAccording to NVDA CEO Jensen Huang, more than $1 trillion in data center infrastructure and hardware will be built over the next four years, doubling the current global supply of computing power. Despite increases in efficiency over the long term, Huang believes that the extraordinary rise of AI means data center spending is likely to skyrocket, marking the \u201cbeginning of this new era.\u201d NVDA has already begun to benefit as this prediction unfolds, and the data center business begins to skyrocket over the past twelve months.\n\nNVDA\u2019s data center business logged $18.4 billion in gross sales in the fourth quarter alone, marking an increase of over 400%, year over year. Additionally, the figure surpasses consensus estimates of $17 billion by nearly 10%. Total unit sales for 2023 data center GPUs were estimated at 3.76 million, estimated by TechInsights.\n\nForward forecasts are strong for the data center segment on all fronts. In first quarter earnings, Huang was extraordinarily optimistic about the growth of the data center business. NVDA reported $22.6 billion in data center revenue for the first quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter and 427% from the comparable quarter of the prior year. Huang commented on the explosive growth.\n\nOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets\u2026 We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere \u2014 from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs \u2014 through our expansive network of ecosystem partners\u2026\n\nSince the introduction of generative AI software including ChatGPT, demand for NVDA chipsets, including the H100, has increased significantly. Following the success of ChatGPT, other software giants including Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG) have introduced competing AI-based software to compete with ChatGPT\u2019s growing platform.\n\nThese programs require enormous amounts of electricity and computing power to facilitate basic operations. For example, according to research from EPRI, a Google search uses just 0.3 watt-hours while a query using ChatGPT requires 2.9 watt-hours, nearly 10x the power.\n\nAccording to HPCwire, NVDA maintains near complete dominance over the data center GPU market, capturing 98% of total market share.\n\nNvidia had a dominant 98% market share in data-center GPU shipments in 2023, similar to market share numbers in 2022. When including AMD and Intel, the total data-center GPU unit shipments in 2023 totaled 3.85 million, growing from about 2.67 million units in 2022, according to TechInsights. Nvidia also had a 98% revenue share of the data-center GPU revenue market with $36.2 billion, more than three times the growth from $10.9 billion in 2022.\n\nWhile other manufacturers including Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are pursuing competing technologies, NVDA has won the early stages of the war, establishing a dominant position in the industry and segment. For example, Mark Zuckerberg has commented that META\u2019s computing infrastructure will include over 350,000 H100 graphics cards by the end of 2024. Based on an estimated commercial price of $25,000 to $30,000 per unit.\n\nData Center Demand\n\nRecently, we authored an article taking a critical and in-depth look at rising power demand around the world. As AI contributes to the global, \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d computing gold rush, demand for electricity is surging. Despite increases in efficiency which have historically held steady with elevating demand, the power demand of AI is sufficient to move the needle.\n\nOver the next five years, global data center power demand is forecasted to more than double, expanding to nearly 10% of total power demand in the US. This is a significant divergence from the past ten years, which has seen virtually zero movement in energy demand for data centers.\n\nResearch from large financial institutions including Goldman Sachs (GS) forecasts a significant increase in power demand across the United States. Through 2030, GS forecasts a 15% forward compound annual growth rate in raw power demand for data centers through the end of the decade.\n\nShould forecasts prove correct, data centers will then comprise nearly 10% of aggregate US power demand, a significant increase from current estimates of around 1%-2%. Increasing demand points to a divergence in total power demand for the nation. Over the past decade, demand was largely offset by increasing efficiency. This meant power demand change remained at a net-zero over the span of decades. Data center demand could become the largest demand driver, increasing the net growth rate by 2.4%.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nA recent report from CBRE outlines the growing outlook of data center demand across the world.\n\nDemand for new data center development likely will attract more institutional investment in 2024, as investors are under-allocated to digital infrastructure by 1.5% to 3% compared with other asset classes. Power supply in primary markets increased by 19.2% year-over-year in H1-2023, leading to a 25% increase in new data center construction activity. We expect construction activity in primary markets to surpass 3,000 MW in 2024. Construction completion timelines have been extended by 24 to 72 months due to power supply delays. We believe that Austin-San Antonio and Omaha will continue to see significant interest from investors and developers due to land availability, power infrastructure development and tax incentives.\n\nCBRE\n\nHowever, increasing demand has been met with a critical issue for data center operators. Ongoing capital expenditure to modernize quickly aging data centers is proving an extraordinary cost for data center landlords like Equinix (EQIX). For example, older facilities cannot accommodate the necessary cooling systems demanded by modern data centers. What appears as an issue for some data center owners is a near certain opportunity for NVDA. Larry Ellison, Chairman of Oracle (ORCL) recently commented on the complexities of upgrading legacy assets.\n\nThis AI race is going to go on for a long time. It's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current. And that's going to take larger and larger data centers. \u2026 The data centers we are building include the power plants and the transmission of the power directly into the data center and liquid cooling. And because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch. And that's what we've been doing for some time. And that's what we'll continue to do.\n\nNVDA continues to innovate across their data center product line. This past quarter saw the introduction of several new products in the data center segment, including the Quantum and Spectrum X800 series switches. As NVDA continues to innovate across the segment, these new products will become critical for operators looking to maintain a competitive position. Data center operators like EQIX are critical partners for NVDA and their ongoing requirement for new chips to either open new facilities or upgrade existing facilities is a significant tailwind.\n\nOutlook & Conclusion\n\nAs data center demand continues to grow at a rapid pace, NVDA stands to be one of the most significant beneficiaries. With 98% of the current market share, no competitor is positioned to seriously compete with NVDA to supply the rising global data center demand. As NVDA continues to innovate, data center operators are pushing to build new facilities and adapt existing facilities to the next generation of customer expectations.\n\nIncreasing power demand, combined with the raw demand for computing power, continues to power extraordinary demand for data centers looking forward. As CBRE continues to forecast extraordinary growth in data center output, NVDA is the most likely candidate to provide the physical components necessary to make the prediction a reality.\n\nOver the past two years, NVDA\u2019s data center segment rose to become the largest individual component of the company\u2019s business. Markets and Markets forecasts that the data center GPU market is expected to grow by 35% annually over the next five years, quadrupling annual demand by 2030. As forward demand is forecasted to grow exponentially, NVDA has more upside left in the tank for new and existing products. As the company grows to occupy the seat briefly as the largest in the world, new and growing demand could act as a further driver for the technology giant.\n\nNVDA has laid aggressive plans, including the path to a \u201cmillion-plus GPU\u201d data center. As technology aligns to the GPU renaissance, there is one market participant that stands head and shoulders above the rest.",

        "title": "Nike Q4 Earnings: The Sneaker Leader That Missed The Innovation Train (NYSE:NKE)",
        "body": "Robert Way\n\nIntroduction & Investment Thesis\n\nNike (NYSE:NYSE:NKE) reported its Q4 FY24 earnings on June 27, and the shares plunged over 10% as the retailer cut its full-year guidance and expects sales to decline in the mid-single digits in FY25. So far, the company has severely underperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 YTD. During the earnings call, the management outlined that FY25 will be a year of transition, especially as the company tries to reposition itself with a renewed focus on innovation in Performance, while managing global macro uncertainty and uneven consumer trends.\n\nIn FY24, the company grew its revenues by just 1% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the management attributed the weakness to its Lifestyle business, which declined during the quarter, along with shrinking digital sales and uneven geographic performance. Even though the management has taken initiatives to improve its overall profitability, I believe that the stock will remain under downward pressure after assessing the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cbad\u201d in the earnings report.\n\nAs a result, I will rate the stock a \u201csell\u201d at its current levels.\n\nThe Good: Renewed focus on Performance Sport, profitability.\n\nNike reported its Q4 FY24 earnings, where full-year revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $51.4B, with Nike Brand contributing 96% of Total Revenue, and Converse accounting for the remaining 4%, with YoY growth declining 15%. Within the Nike Brand, Nike Direct Revenues contributed 43.6% to revenue, which grew 1% led by growth in Nike-owned stores, while Wholesale Revenue contributed the remaining 56.4%, growing 2% YoY on a currency neutral basis.\n\nQ4 FY24 earnings report: Revenue breakdown by sales channels\n\nDuring the earnings call, John Donahoe, CEO of Nike outlined that Nike saw strong gains within their Performance products during the quarter, which grew in double digits in many of their key sports, while demand for Lifestyle products declined.\n\nAs the company continues to make strategic shifts to better position themselves in an uncertain macroeconomic and highly competitive environment, they are sharpening their focus on performance sports by accelerating the pace of innovation and speed to the consumer. For example, Nike saw double-digit growth in basketball in Q4 driven by innovations in Kobe\u2019s new footwear and apparel and Sabrina 1, while they announced the signing of Caitlin Clark to the roster of athletes to fuel the growth of women\u2019s basketball business.\n\nAt the same time, the company is also seeing double-digit growth in fitness apparel with new innovations, while women\u2019s fitness footwear also had a strong quarter driven by Motiva and the latest version of Free Metcon. Plus, the company continues to amplify their game in road running with new releases in Vomero, Invincible, Infinity, and Structure that grew in high double digits during the quarter, while launching Pegasus 41 a few weeks ago, which had a better than expected start with strong sales in both wholesale and Nike Direct.\n\nShifting gears to profitability, gross margins increased 110 basis points to 44.6% in FY24, which was driven by strategic pricing and favorable ocean freight and logistics costs. Meanwhile, FY24 diluted earnings per share grew 15% YoY to $3.73 as the company continued to streamline expenses through product cycle transition as they consolidated suppliers and optimized technology spend, among other initiatives to maximize customer impact and fuel the next phase of their growth.\n\nIn fact, in Q4, the company reduced their SG&A expenses by 7% YoY to 32.4% of Total Revenue, thus unlocking operating margin in the fourth quarter. In terms of geographic breakdown, North America contributed close to 88% of total Earnings before Income Taxes on a GAAP basis, growing 7% YoY.\n\nFinally, the company is successfully unlocking its working capital by improving its days in inventory as inventory levels declined 11% YoY for the full year FY24, allowing its cash from operations to grow 27% YoY to $7.4B during the same period.\n\nQ4 FY24 Earnings Report: EBIT Breakdown by Geographies\n\nThe Bad: Decline in Lifestyle Revenues, Lumpy Geographic Performance.\n\nAlthough the management has outlined that FY25 will be a year of transition as they kick-start a multi-year innovation cycle, I believe there are some glaring areas of concern in the current earnings report. One of them is the decline in their lifestyle businesses in Q4, despite the company innovating and launching new products.\n\nDuring the earnings call, the management outlined the need for a diversified lifestyle portfolio, and as part of the initiative, they will be accelerating planned reductions for three franchises, which they expect to have a meaningful impact on their Lifestyle growth rate, while simultaneously scaling new footwear concepts in the second half of FY25.\n\nAt the same time, the company continues to see uneven trends across operating geographies. For instance, for the full year, while North America revenue declined 1%, EMEA revenues were flat YoY, and Greater China and APAL grew 8% and 5% YoY, respectively. However, it is important to note that the China marketplace remains highly promotional, as brick-and-mortar traffic has declined and Nike continues to manage its inventory carefully.\n\nSomething that clearly stood out to me was that digital sales declined across all geographies with the exception of China in Q4, which weighed down on Nike Direct\u2019s total revenue growth rate driven by softer traffic and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises.\n\nQ4 FY24 Earnings Report: Revenue breakdown by geographies\n\nThe management is aware of these headwinds that they are facing, and as a result, they have guided for softer revenue expectations of a mid-single-digit decline in FY25 as they manage the product cycle transition by shifting their channel mix dynamics. I believe global macroeconomic uncertainty is a considerable factor as retail sales in the US are declining with discretionary customer budgets squeezed amidst a high interest rate environment and weakening labor market conditions, while conditions in China and EMEA remain uncertain.\n\nTying it together: No sign of a bottom just yet\n\nI mentioned earlier that FY25 will be a year of transition as management attempts to reposition Nike to be more competitive by balancing their product portfolio with sustainable and long-term profitable growth.\n\nAs the company refocuses its innovation efforts on Performance, it also has to manage macro uncertainty and uneven consumer trends as it reduces the amount of products in favor of new innovation. For the full year FY25, the company expects that revenue will decline in the mid-single digits. Assuming that the company gains its footing back and grows in line with the projected nominal GDP growth of the US, which is a reasonable proxy for retail sales in the US, it should generate close to $53.8B by FY27.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the company expects its gross margins to improve 10\u201330 basis points in FY25 as they benefit from strategic pricing and lower product input costs. Simultaneously, it expects its SG&A expenses to grow slightly YoY as it invests in demand creation, especially with the Paris Olympics next month, which is an opportunity to ignite brand momentum and maximize reach.\n\nTherefore, assuming that diluted EPS remains flat YoY, followed by growth in the range of consensus estimates, we see that it will be growing at a slightly faster pace than projected revenue growth as it is able to improve its unit economics as the demand environment improves. This means that it will generate $4.66 in diluted EPS in FY27, which will be equivalent to a present value of $3.85 when discounted at 10%.\n\nTaking the S&P 500 as a proxy, where its companies grow their earnings on average by 8% over a 10-year period, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 15-18, I believe that Nike should be trading at par with the S&P 500, given the growth rate of its earnings during this period of time. This will translate to a PE ratio of 17, or a price target of $65, which represents a downside of 20% from its current levels.\n\nAuthor's Valuation Model\n\nMy Verdict and Conclusions\n\nAlthough Nike has a long history of strong innovation and operation excellence, it has found itself in a rough patch, with revenue growth slowing while facing increasing competition from newer innovative brands in certain categories, such as HOKA. While it is managing its sales through a combination of Direct and Wholesale, the management has also been taking initiatives to boost profitability through cost-cutting efforts as well as improving its operating cash flow by reducing its inventory levels, especially as certain franchises have been performing poorly.\n\nAlthough I am optimistic that Nike will get its footing back over the coming years, I still believe that its current valuation is elevated given the projected growth rate in revenue and earnings. As a result, I believe the stock will face downward pressure as investor sentiment remains dampened, at least until the management starts to demonstrate progress in accelerating its growth story.\n\nTill then, I will rate it a \u201csell\u201d at its current levels.",

Yes, there can be such a thing as too much cash.\n\nChoosing money markets over investments with more growth potential can impact long-term portfolio performance. Corporate bonds, core bonds, and stocks \u2014 and the funds that invest in them \u2014 may be better long-term options for some of this money, in my opinion. Here's why.\n\n(For a deeper dive, see my chartbook Beyond money markets: Maximizing cash.)\n\n1. Lower return over time\n\nShort-term cash-like investments have historically generated significantly lower return than longer-term government bonds, corporate bonds, and stocks, as the example below shows.\n\nYes, cash-like investments may outperform Treasuries over short time periods, but using the same 30-year time period as the example below, Treasuries outperformed cash during 93% of the rolling monthly 10-year periods during the past 30 years.1\n\nCash has a significantly lower return over the long term (1994-2024)\n\n2. Locking in long-term rates may be better\n\nReinvestment risk is among the biggest challenges of investing in short-term securities, such as money markets, because that money generally has to be reinvested every few months. At some point, interest rates will fall from today\u2019s elevated levels, and the money market will have to reinvest in lower-yielding securities. Investors who like today\u2019s yields may be better off locking them in for the longer term with bonds.\n\nHow might investors move out of cash?\n\nLet\u2019s look at three instances when cash balances were high - following the 1991 and 2002 recessions, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the 2009 European debt crisis - and calculate what $12,000 invested yearly in the stock market for 10 years would have been worth. Since there are many ways to put cash back to work, I considered four investing scenarios:\n\nPerfect timing assumes that an investor maximized their return in the S&P 500\u00ae Index each year. Worst timing assumes that an investor minimized their return in the S&P 500 Index each year. First of the year imagines an investor moving the entire $12,000 into stocks as a lump sum at the start of each year. Dollar-cost averaging assumes an investor made a $1,000 per month investment in the index yearly.\n\nI compared each of these strategies with the returns an investor would have if they simply continued to hold cash (calculated using the Bloomberg 1-3 Month US Treasury Index).\n\nInvestors have been better off investing their money versus holding cash\n\nIn each instance, investors would have been better off investing their money in stocks versus holding cash \u2014 regardless of how they did it. Investing a lump sum at the first of the year and dollar-cost averaging were both sound strategies. While all investors would like perfect timing, even having the worst timing each year still outperformed cash.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 Source: Bloomberg, L.P., 1994 through 2024.

        "body": "peshkov\n\nI am a big fan of stock picking. But I am also a big fan of sector-specific Exchange-Traded Funds. One such ETF I think is really interesting right now is the iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO). This fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index. It gives investors exposure to U.S. companies that are engaged in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and gas.\n\nThe fund holds 46 stocks of large and mid-sized companies. The fund is liquid, with a 30-Day Median Bid/Ask Spread of just 0.03%, and the fund trades very close to Net Asset Value. The sector is pretty cheap, with a trailing P/E ratio of 8.62x. An expense ratio of 0.40% is also at the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nWhat is good about the iShares suite of ETFs is there is a lot of useful information on the fund's website to understand risk, fund composition, past performance and costs. I like the fund because it is focused on US names, which reduces international risk, and it is focused on mainly on crude oil, oil product and natural gas producers, in a medium term environment where I believe commodity prices will remain robust and production will grow.\n\nInvestors who want some international exposure can consider the iShares MSCI Global Energy Producers ETF (FILL), however my preference in the ETF space is for a diversified basket of US companies as I think for international exposure more research needs to be done, and then it would be better to do hold a basket of individually selected stocks.\n\nThe fund does not hold equipment and services names, whose companies are competing for market share in winning contracts and have to execute often complex projects at tight margins. Therefore, this ETF is a clean play on the macro view of strong oil, oil product and natural gas prices and production growth for US companies.\n\nIndeed, the whole oil & gas sector seems to be cheap right now, as the Energy sector (which is all oil and gas) currently makes just 3.6% of the weight of the S&P 500. With the importance of energy in the US and global economies, this seems far too low, even in an era where \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d. Ironically, the data boom, is driving increasing energy demand as artificial intelligence boosts global data centre demand, data centres are highly electricity intensive. As data centres need to run 24/7, they cannot be supplied solely by renewable energy, and thus the gas fired electricity production is likely to grow faster in the next 10 years, as it has in the last ten years.\n\nThe interesting thing about the IEO fund is it is actually quite diversified. iShares breaks it down into about 75% Oil & Gas Exploration & Production and 25% Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing & Transportation. The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index, which is a market cap weighted index, rebalanced quarterly. The fund picks the largest companies from the oil & gas exploration and production subsector in the US based on the Dow Jones Industry Classification System - DJICS - methodology. This market cap approach is a fair and sensible approach to broadly represent this subsector.\n\nIn terms of weighting classification, my own analysis is slightly different. By my analysis I would say the fund currently holds about 65.5% of oil and gas exploration and production companies that are production heavy, given ConocoPhillips (COP) and EOG Resources (EOG) are the two largest holdings, making up a combined 29% of the fund\u2019s weight. Both these companies are solid, and I will return to them later. These 25 E&P companies typically produce crude oil and condensate (light hydrocarbon liquid), natural gas liquids and natural gas.\n\nAbout 24% of the fund is in Refining and Marketing and oil product logistics, 10% in natural gas focused producers, including with natural gas liquids and liquified natural gas, 0.5% in ethanol producers, although large refining companies such as Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Valero Energy (VLO) are not just gasoline producers but are building up capacity in biofuels such as ethanol and new fuels for sustainable aviation.\n\nSo, the fund is not just a crude oil play, and the fund\u2019s benchmark is slightly a misnomer.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at each component in a bit more detail.\n\nCrude Oil\n\nDifferent organisations have quite different forecasts for oil demand and supply. The International Energy Agency believes that demand will peak by the end of the decade and that there will be a glut of oil in the market. However, the IEA has been accused of bias in that it is making assumptions about the energy transition which may be too optimistic in the roll-out of clean energy. The Opec cartel is much more bullish about oil demand, although it can be accused of talking its own book. The US Energy Information Administration is somewhere in the middle, seeing oil demand growth past the end of this decade. While the rise of electric vehicles is a thread to oil demand, a recent Financial Times articles noted that the growth of EV sales in the US has been slowing, as EVs are still not competitive for the mass market and the US car fleet turnover is quite slow. My own view is that oil prices will hold steady has the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East disrupt oil international oil production and flows and embed a higher than normal risk premium in the oil price. Ukraine, in recent months, has been attacking Russian oil refineries with drones and this certainly is an upside risk for oil prices if this continues.\n\nBecause of this, US producers are incentivised to grow production, and that is what has been happening.\n\nIn early June, Opec+ members agreed to extend deep cuts in oil production, in some cases to the end of 2025, as they battle to shore up prices amid weak global demand and increased supply from other parts of the world. The book Oil Leaders by Ibrahim Al Muhanna who is an adviser to the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, notes how over the medium term, OPEC has been successful in managing the price to a level members want and need. According to Reuters, OPEC currently favours a price closer to $90 a barrel. So my view is the medium term oil price will average around $90/bbl.\n\nThe fund holds Hess Corp (HES) and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO), which are being acquired by Chevron and ConocoPhillips respectively.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nNot only do we have the electrification of cars (albeit slowing) and the growth of energy-intensive data centres, but in April this year the G7 agreed to end use of unabated coal power plants by 2035. According to Energy Intelligence, coal accounts for roughly 37% of the world\u2019s electricity production and 15% of G7 countries\u2019 production.\n\nEnergy Intelligence notes, \u201cPhasing out coal likely means G7 countries will rely more on natural gas while they continue to build out the capacity of renewables and the technology of nuclear energy.\u201d\n\nAll this makes me very bullish on natural gas, and I believe over time, the IEO fund will become less oily and more gassy. The important thing is that the fund already has good exposure to natural gas, holding for example EQT Corp (EQT), and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Southwestern Energy (SWN) which are in the process of merging. The fund also holds Kosmos Energy and Tellurian, which both have important LNG assets. With the ongoing ware in war in Ukraine, and Europe unable to rely on Russian gas imports, international LNG is becoming an important market to plug those shortfalls.\n\nRefining & Marketing\n\nAs mentioned, this fund has quite a heavy weight towards refining and marketing companies and holds nine companies in this subsector. The three largest, Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Valero Energy (VLO), in total make up 21% of the fund. PSX not long ago announced it is getting rid of non-core assets and VLO has said it is going to pay out 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. All three companies are growing their biofuels business as a long-term hedge against the energy transition. The ETF also holds two small ethanol pure plays, Green Plains Inc. (GPRE) and Rex American Resources Corp (REX).\n\nConcentrated positions\n\nThe fund\u2019s two largest positions are ConocoPhillips (COP) and EOG Resources (EOG) are the two largest holdings, at about 19% and 10% of the fund\u2019s weight respectively. This might grow as ConocoPhillips acquires fellow holding Marathon Oil.\n\nSA Analysts give COP a 4.00 / BUY rating. The most recent analyst to cover COP has a Strong Buy rating, and writes how the Marathon Oil deal will create potential for synergy effects and dividend growth and notes \u201cthe company is set for accelerating capital returns\u201d. For me, one thing I like about COP is that on its board, its Audit and Finance Committee Chair is Arjun N. Murti, who was one of the best energy analysts on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs in the first part of this century. This really bodes well for capital allocation at COP.\n\nEOG Resources (EOG) is the second-largest holding. SA Analysts also give EOG a 4.00 / BUY rating. The most recent article on EOG calls the company \u201ca top-tier liquid-weighted shale producer with strong financial projections and stock price improvement potential.\u201d And also \u201cEOG Resources is committed to cost control, technology innovation, and capital return to shareholders, making it a strong investment option in the current market conditions.\u201d\n\nIndeed, EOG has been a leader in technology innovation. The company pioneered the Enhanced Oil Recovery \u2013 EOR - method of oil production from shale rock back in 2016. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management said, \u201cWe're still seeing the outstanding strong results that we talked about earlier. Consistently 20% uplift in the first-year production in EOR.\u201d\n\nThe third-largest position of the fund with about 8.9% weight is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). SA Analysts also give MPC a 4.00 / BUY rating. The most recent article about the company notes MPC remains bullish on the future of refined products and margins, with a strong midstream segment and commitment to shareholder value through buybacks and dividends.\n\nRisks\n\nClearly, energy commodity prices and production levels are a risk, and investors might want to regularly read the monthly reports from the International Energy Agency - IEA -, the Energy Information Administration - EIA -, and OPEC to keep an eye on market conditions, as well as follow regulatory filings from and Seeking Alpha articles on COP and EOG to follow developments at these two large holdings in the fund. Having nearly 20% in one holding does present a somewhat idiosyncratic risk, although I am confident in the management of ConocoPhillips, but the risk is less than holding any one company due to the diversified nature of the overall fund.\n\nBecause my view is for production growth across the sector, which is what both the IEA and EIA are predicting, and for robust or increasing energy commodity prices, then over the medium term I believe earnings will grow steadily. This means even if the fund's P/E of 8.6x doesn't rerate, the fund's net asset value will still increase. However, as investors realise the importance of the energy sector, given the demand growth and increased need for energy security, there should be improved sentiment around the sector leading to P/E multiple expansion. So I believe the net asset value of the fund should increase with growing earnings, driven by revenue that grows through both price and volume appreciation, and multiple expansion. Given the trading liquidity of the fund, the fund price should track closely to the Net Asset Value, as it is now.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF gives broad exposure to an important sector, which I feel is broadly underweight in the US stock market. Although the top five holdings make up about 50% of the fund, these are robust companies. Excluding the integrated oil and gas companies, every company in the fund is a pure play company as an Exploration and Production company or Refining and Marketing company, with decent exposure to the long-term growth areas of natural gas production, LNG trade, and biofuels demand, while the medium-term outlook for oil production is also robust. The U.S. nature of the companies reduces the geopolitical risks for the fund at the holding level\n\nFinal note: there are alternative oil and gas ETFs to consider, which are each have different themes and subsector exposures than IEO has, but my preference at the moment is IEO given the above analysis:",

        "body": "MCCAIG\n\nWe have written quite extensively over the last several years as to why it's a huge misunderstanding to believe that the largest U.S. banks will be safer than smaller banks in a systemic crisis scenario. Last week, we published an article in which we discussed that the largest banks (assets > $250B) posted the sharpest increase in the CRE delinquency ratio, according to the FDIC. The FDIC also reported that larger U.S. banks (assets > $100B) have significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector in terms of deposit dynamics. Larger banks posted a 6.8% outflow, while community banks showed a 1% increase.\n\nThe FDIC has recently published another very interesting set of data. According to the regulator, the sector\u2019s ratio of liquid assets to total assets fell to 26% in 4Q23, which is the lowest since the end of 2013. This decline in liquid assets was due to significant deposit outflows posted by the largest U.S. banks. As the chart below shows, banks had to sell securities.\n\nFDIC\n\nIn response to deposit outflows and falling liquidity levels, banks had to attract wholesale funding, which is volatile and more expensive than deposit funding. Unsurprisingly, that made the liquidity profile of the U.S. banking sector weaker. FDIC concluded the following (emphasis is ours):\n\nIn 2024, tighter liquidity positions and higher reliance on wholesale funding will increase funding risk for some banks should market stress or rapid changes in market conditions occur. Even if market interest rates decline in 2024, banks with low liquidity positions, higher unrealized securities losses, insufficient access to off-balance-sheet secured borrowing lines, or volatility in deposit retention may continue to experience heightened liquidity pressure.\n\nOf course, the most interesting thing here is how all these changes in liquid assets and funding sources have affected the banks\u2019 net interest margins. For starters, this indicator is calculated by dividing a bank\u2019s total net interest income by its average interest-earnings assets. The ratio is among the key performance indicators of any bank and its main earnings driver.\n\nThe banking industry\u2019s median NIM increased in 2023. However, only 53% of banks reported an increase in NIM in 2023 compared to 66% in 2022. Importantly, 65% of larger banks posted declines in their NIMs. As such, the industry\u2019s metric was supported by smaller community banks. The chart below demonstrates this as 53% of banks with assets of $100MM\u2013$1B and 71% of banks with assets less than $100M delivered a positive change in the margins.\n\nFDIC\n\nBottom line\n\nBelieve it or not, there are more major issues on larger bank balance sheets relative to smaller banks, which we have covered in past articles. Moreover, consider that there was one major issue which caused the GFC back in 2008, whereas today, we currently have many more large issues on bank balance sheets. So, in our opinion, the current banking environment presents even greater risks than what we have seen during the 2008 GFC.\n\nAlmost all the banks that we have recommended to our clients are community banks, which do not have any of the issues we have been outlining over the last several years. Of course, we're not saying that all community banks are good. There are a lot of small community banks that are much weaker than larger banks. That\u2019s why it's absolutely imperative to engage in a thorough due diligence to find a safer bank for your hard-earned money. And what we have found is that there are still some very solid and safe community banks with conservative business models.\n\nSo, I want to take this opportunity to remind you that we have reviewed many larger banks, including the three just noted, in our public articles. But I must warn you: The substance of that analysis is not looking too good for the future of the larger banks in the United States, and you can read about them in the prior articles we have written. And, as these issues get worse, the risk continues to rise.\n\nMoreover, if you believe that the banking issues have been addressed, I think that New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYCB) is reminding us that we have likely only seen the tip of the iceberg. We were also able to identify the exact reasons in a public article which caused SVB to fail, well before anyone even considered these issues. And I can assure you that they have not been resolved. It's now only a matter of time before the rest of the market begins to take notice. By then, it will likely be too late for many bank deposit holders.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're speaking of protecting your hard-earned money. Therefore, it behooves you to engage in due diligence regarding the banks which currently house your money.\n\nYou have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure your money resides in only the safest of institutions. And if you're relying on the FDIC, I suggest you read our prior articles, which outline why such reliance will not be as prudent as you may believe in the coming years, one of the main reasons being the banking industry's desired move towards bail-ins. (And, if you do not know what a bail-in is, I suggest you read our prior articles.)\n\nIt's time for you to do a deep dive into the banks that house your hard-earned money to determine whether your bank is truly solid or not. You are welcome to use our due diligence methodology outlined here.\n\nHousekeeping Items\n\nThis article, as well as Saferbankingresearch.com, is a combination of efforts between Avi Gilburt and Renaissance Research, which has been covering U.S., European, LatAm, and CEEMEA banking stocks for more than 15 years.\n\nIf you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please hit the button at the bottom of the page to \"Follow\" me.\n\nAlso, for those who are questioning why all comments (including mine) go through moderation, you can read here: Haters Are Gonna Hate - Until They Learn.",

        "body": "NicoElNino\n\nIn my financial choices, I always suppose starting from 60-40, and I assume that the portfolio is totally invested in two great classics of the market:\n\n60% of the equity is 100% invested in the iShares MSCI World ETF (NYSEARCA:URTH) On the other hand, 40% of the bond is entirely invested in the Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (NASDAQ:BNDW).\n\nStarting from the composition of the URTH and the BNDW I think it is preferable to focus on specific geographical and thematic sectors. For the equity component, there is a particular focus on emerging markets, European REITs and US Small Caps, while for the bond component on European bonds.\n\nIt does make sense to maintain a 60-40 composition?\n\nA first question to ask in this historical moment could be, does it make sense to maintain a 60-40 composition?\n\nIn my opinion, not in the past, but now absolutely. The 60-40 portfolio can be a good compromise even today. There are upcoming events to consider. The first is the opening of the second half of the year, while the second one is the shadow of lower interest rates.\n\nRegarding the arrival of the second half of the year, a study by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, reassures us about the performance of the stock market: since 1945, the S&P 500 index has recorded an average growth of 5% in the second half of the year when the return of the first half was positive while in years when the index gained more than 10% in the first six months, average gains in the second half were 8%. You can find an interesting opinion of his at the link in this video.\n\nAfter that, the question must be asked: how should we deal with the possible lowering of interest rates? In my opinion, it is appropriate to maintain at least 40% exposure to the bond market.\n\nAs is well known, lower rates could help raise the price of bonds and provide a more attractive return than stocks in a period of increased volatility.\n\nThe truth is that the bond market has better return prospects than the same segment of the stock market has experienced over the past 20 years.\n\nWhich geographies should be positioned in the equity component?\n\nURTH ETF has a composition as follows:\n\nUnited States: about 60%\n\nEurope: about 20%\n\nJapan: about 10%\n\nOther developed markets: about 10%\n\nThere are undervalued geographic areas that could benefit from the current economic context. In fact, in my opinion, it is a smart choice to maintain more portfolio exposure to emerging economies, such as China. As explained in this article. A smart investment choice, especially considering the depreciation that some developed country currencies might experience during the process of lowering interest rates, might be to select which ETF invests in emerging markets. Such as the one well described in this article, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). EEM, unlike the MSCI Index which is not representative in the emerging markets segment, offers a solution for investing in emerging markets, with a large exposure to China (around 31%).\n\nDoes it make sense to follow the sector composition of the URTH ETF?\n\nURTH consists of several areas, including:\n\nTechnology: about 20%\n\nFinancial: about 15%\n\nHealth care: about 13%\n\nDiscretionary consumption: about 12 percent\n\nIndustrial: about 10%\n\nOther sectors: about 30 percent\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nIn view of the lowering of rates, it may be wise to consider changing the positive weight of cyclical sectors that could be weighed down by current financial conditions, such as real estate, and reducing the financials component. This component is already overrepresented in the index, and has also already benefited greatly from the rise in rates in recent years. In this sense, the stock market component of real estate REITs becomes very interesting. A very popular ETF for having a balanced exposure globally is the iShares Global REIT ETF (REET), a nice description of the instrument can be found here.\n\nIn this regard, I would like to offer my personal perspective. I am of the opinion that it would be intriguing to consider incorporating more European Real Estate Investment Trusts into the portfolio, given their historical trend of aligning with that of the United States. However, it is evident by comparing the US and EU property yields that the activity of real estate trusts in Europe has experienced a greater impact from the increase in rates. Furthermore, given that the ECB has been ahead of the Fed in the initial cuts, it could potentially result in a substantial premium in European REITs.\n\nUS Property Yields (TradingView)\n\nOn the other hand, despite the technology sector's significant growth in terms of stock market performance, it continues to exhibit strong fundamentals and sustainable growth, justifying maintaining a good level of exposure.\n\nWhat about URTH capitalization?\n\nIn terms of capitalization, the MSCI World is dominated by large caps, with a small percentage of mid and small caps.\n\nSmall caps, on the other hand, could represent an attractive opportunity to further diversify the portfolio. These companies, although riskier, have been plagued on the stock market due to particularly restrictive financial conditions. In a period of falling interest rates, small caps can benefit from better financing conditions and increase their growth. I honestly think there is little to discuss about small caps, I will always prefer the American growth component, and I explain the reasons here.\n\nHow do you manage fixed income in a 60-40 portfolio now?\n\nStarting with the BNDW, there is a global exposure to the bond market with a strong US prevalence, around 40%, as it should be in a global fund. I think for the time being, high-yield bonds can be set aside, or at least put in as a minimal percentage. Over the past six months, high yield bond yields have offered attractive returns, but the spread over investment grade has narrowed significantly. As rates fall, the risk premium on high yield bonds may not be as attractive as it has been in the past. Therefore, it may make more sense to increase exposure to investment-grade bonds, which offer a better risk-reward ratio in a falling interest rate environment.\n\nHY - IGY US Spread (FRED)\n\nRegarding geographical allocation, there is an important consideration to be made regarding Europe.\n\nIn recent weeks, European government bond yields have risen sharply despite the ECB's first-rate cut. This has happened because of the intensification of political reasons. However, as explained here, I sincerely think that these instabilities will impact bond prices ONLY in the short term. In the long term, considering a growth rate of the European economy, and the lowering of rates initiated by the ECB, an excellent investment opportunity has been created. For this reason, I think that a solution to include in the portfolio could be the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF Shares (BNDX) which excludes the United States and gives a significant weight to Europe (almost 30%).\n\nWhy might these considerations not be suitable for every reader?\n\nAs you well know, there are some variables that are decisive for the construction of an investment portfolio.\n\nFirst, the age of the investor is a key factor: young people tend to be more aggressive, as they have more time to recoup any losses. A young investor may therefore have more exposure to stocks, which offer higher potential returns but also greater volatility.\n\nIn reverse, an older investor, close to retirement, may prefer a more conservative portfolio, with a higher allocation to bonds, to protect capital and generate income.\n\nAnd this is where a second variable comes into play: risk appetite. This last element varies from person to person, can be independent of age, and depend on the needs of an individual at a specific time in life.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the 60-40 portfolio remains a very interesting composition in my opinion. Rather than following the composition of the URTH ETF and the BNDW ETF, it remains an interesting choice to evaluate greater exposure towards geographical areas and sectors that could benefit from this cyclical change in the markets.",

        "body": "US stocks rose on Friday as the latest reading from a closely watched inflation gauge extended a story of cooling inflation and as investors absorbed the fallout of the Biden-Trump debate.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) advanced roughly 0.1% after the benchmark closed a step nearer to its record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI lost about 0.1%\n\nThe gauges are eyeing an upbeat end to a bumpy week that saw the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq come back from a three-day losing streak. While stocks are set to book a stellar first half as they wrap the last trading day of June, those wobbles have fanned fears of a pullback for the rest of the year.\n\nThe last significant data point of the first six months of the year came in the form of the the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 0.1 % in May from the prior month, in line with Wall Street's expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, with November's US election high on the list of risks, investors took note of President Joe Biden's weak showing in his first debate against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. The former president's promised tax cuts and trade clampdown are seen as likely to boost stocks. Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) jumped in morning trading.\n\nThe market is also on alert for more signs that consumer resilience is losing steam, as key companies flag downbeat prospects for sales. Nike (NKE) stock sank more than 15% in early trading, while Walgreens (WBA) shares remained under pressure on the heels of Thursday's 22% tumble.\n\nLive 4 updates Stocks rise as the Fed's preferred inflation metric shows further cooling US stocks rose on Friday as the latest reading from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation continues to cool, raising the likelihood of a rate cut in the months to come.

The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.1 % in May from the prior month, in line with Wall Street's expectations and slower than the 0.3% increase seen in April. Core PCE was up 2.6% over the prior year in May, in line with estimates and unchanged from the annual increase seen in the last two months. May's reading marked the slowest annual gain in more than three years.\n\nTrump Media on the move After a shaky debate performance by President Joe Biden, shares of Trump Media & Technology (DJT) are on the move. As of this writing, shares are up 7.5% in pre-market trading. Be mindful of what you are trading here, folks. Here is the company's latest 10-Q report, showing a \"company\" that is doing something and losing a lot of money doing it.\n\nNike shares getting stepped on Equally as bad to watch (sort of ... ) as last night's debate is Nike's (NKE) stock in the pre-market, down 14% as of this writing. The company's guidance was a real letdown, and concerns linger about its management's execution around product innovation. To not see better guidance from Nike in an Olympic year is a red flag. I liked Stifel analyst Jim Duffy's take on the quarter: \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring 2025 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25. Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty. An investor day in Nov. will likely outline a multi-year economic model with lower returns than the precedent adding risk to the premium enjoyed in the historical multiple. We remain appreciative of N scale advantage in a category with secular growth tailwinds and structural margin potential but, at the current valuation, can\u2019t support a compelling upside case until growth inflection becomes more tangible.\" Duffy downgraded his rating on Nike to hold this morning.",

        "title": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang plays down competition worries as key supplier disappoints with subdued expectations for AI chip sales",
        "body": "Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips, CEO Jensen Huang told investors, even as rivals push to cut into his market share and one of Nvidia's major suppliers gave a subdued forecast for AI chip sales.\n\nEveryone from OpenAI to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla rely on Nvidia semiconductors to run their large language or computer vision models. The roll out of Nvidia's \u201cBlackwell\u201d system later this year will only cement that lead, Huang said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\n\nUnveiled in March, Blackwell is the next generation of AI training processors to follow its flagship \u201cHopper\u201d line of H100 chips\u2014one of the most prized possessions in the tech industry fetching prices in the tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\n\u201cThe Blackwell architecture platform likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,\u201d Huang said.\n\nNvidia briefly eclipsed Microsoft and Apple this month to become the world\u2019s most valuable company in a remarkable rally that has fueled much of this year\u2019s gains in the S&P 500 index. At more than $3 trillion, Huang\u2019s company was at one point worth more than entire economies and stock markets, only to suffer a record loss in market value as investors locked in profits.\n\nYet as long as Nvidia chips continue to be the benchmark for AI training, there\u2019s little reason to believe the longer-term outlook is cloudy and here the fundamentals continue to look robust.\n\nOne of Nvidia's key advantages is a sticky AI ecosystem known as CUDA, short for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Much like how everyday consumers are loath to switch from their Apple iOS device to a Samsung phone using Google Android, an entire cohort of developers have been working with CUDA for years and feel so comfortable there is little reason to consider using another software platform. Much like the hardware, CUDA effectively has become a standard of its own.\n\n\u201cThe Nvidia platform is broadly available through every major cloud provider and computer maker, creating a large and attractive base for developers and customers, which makes our platform more valuable to our customers,\u201d Huang added on Wednesday.\n\nMicron's in-line guidance for next quarter revenue not enough for bulls\n\nThe AI trade did take a recent hit after memory chip supplier Micron Technology, a supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to companies like Nvidia, forecast fiscal fourth quarter revenue would only match market expectations of around $7.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares in Micron plunged 7%, underperforming by a large margin a slight gain in the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nIn the past, Micron and its Korean rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have seen cyclical boom and busts common to the memory chip market, long considered a commodity business when compared with logic chips such as graphic processors.\n\nBut excitement has surged as demand for its chips needed for AI training. Micron's stock more than doubled over the past 12 months, meaning investors have already priced in much of management's predicted growth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Noos2Mfdcg\n\n\u201cThe guidance was basically in line with expecations and in the AI hardware world if you guide in line that\u2019s considered a slight disappointment,\u201d says Gene Munster, a tech investor with Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cMomentum investors just didn\u2019t see that incremental reason to be more positive about the story.\u201d\n\nAnalysts closely track demand for high bandwidth memory as a leading indicator for the AI industry because it is so crucial for solving the biggest economic constraint facing AI training today\u2014the issue of scaling.\n\nHBM chips address scaling problem in AI training\n\nCosts crucially do not rise in line with a model\u2019s complexity\u2014the number of parameters it has, which can number into the billions\u2014but rather grow exponentially. This results in diminishing returns in efficiency over time.\n\nEven if revenue grows at a consistent rate, losses risk ballooning into the billions or even tens of billions a year as a model gets more advanced. This threatens to overwhelm any company that doesn\u2019t have a deep-pocketed investor like Microsoft capable of ensuring an OpenAI can still \u201cpay the bills\u201d, as CEO Sam Altman phrased it recently.\n\nA key reason for the diminishing returns is the growing gap between the two factors that dictate AI training performance. The first is a logic chip\u2019s raw compute power\u2014as measured by FLOPS, a type of calculation per second\u2014and the second is the memory bandwidth needed to quickly feed it data\u2014often expressed in millions of transfers per second, or MT/s.\n\nSince they work in tandem, scaling one without the other simply leads to waste and cost inefficiency. That\u2019s why FLOPS utilization, or how much of the compute can actually be brought to bear, is a key metric when judging the cost efficiency of AI models.\n\nSold out through the end of next year\n\nAs Micron points out, data transfer rates have been unable to keep pace with rising compute power. The resulting bottleneck, often referred to as the \"memory wall\" is a leading cause for today\u2019s inherent inefficiency when scaling AI training models.\n\nThat explains why the U.S. government focused heavily on memory bandwidth when deciding which specific Nvidia chips needed to be banned from export to China in order to weaken Beijing\u2019s AI development program.\n\nOn Wednesday, Micron said its HBM business was \u201csold out\u201d all the way through the end of the next calendar year, which trails its fiscal year by one quarter, echoing similar comments from Korean competitor SK Hynix.\n\n\u201cWe expect to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in FY24 and multiple [billions of dollars] in revenue from HBM in FY25,\u201d Micron said on Wednesday.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Prosecutors to call last witness in Senator Menendez corruption trial By Reuters",
        "body": "By Luc Cohen\n\nNEW YORK - Prosecutors expect to call their final witness on Friday in U.S. Senator Bob Menendez's corruption trial, paving the way for the once-powerful lawmaker to mount his defense.\n\nDuring six weeks in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors have sought to portray the senior New Jersey senator as a greedy politician who attempted to help foreign governments and interfere in criminal probes into associates who bribed him and his wife with gold bars, cash, a car, and home payments.\n\nMenendez has pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and obstruction. His wife, Nadine Menendez, has also pleaded not guilty and is set to go on trial in August.\n\nBob Menendez's defense lawyers have sought to distance him from his wife's financial dealings. They have portrayed actions that prosecutors have described as nefarious - such as the senator aiding the governments of Egypt and Qatar, or conversations with prosecutors about his associates' cases - as routine legislative work and constituent advocacy.\n\n\"It's not enough to prove that Senator Menendez or Nadine Menendez received a benefit and that Senator Menendez took an official act,\" said Paul Tuchmann, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana and former federal prosecutor who is not involved in the case. \"They have to prove it is one for the other.\"\n\nMenendez, 70, stepped down as chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations after being charged in September, but has resisted calls from fellow Democrats to resign from the Senate. He is running for re-election in the Nov. 5 election as an independent.\n\nHis lawyers have said they may call 21 witnesses, though they have not named them.\n\nIn a court filing on Thursday, prosecutors said defense lawyers told them they would call Menendez's older sister to testify about the senator's \"personal and family history of storing cash outside of banks.\"\n\nMenendez's defense lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nThe defense will have to contend with damaging testimony from government witnesses. Jose Uribe, an insurance broker who pleaded guilty to bribing Menendez, testified that after he helped Nadine Menendez buy a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz (OTC: ), the senator told him he \"saved\" two of his associates from New Jersey state probes.\n\nPhilip Sellinger, New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, testified that after he expressed interest in that job in late 2020, Menendez told him that he thought businessman Fred Daibes - who had been indicted for fraud - was being treated unfairly. Daibes is on trial alongside Menendez, having pleaded not guilty to bribing the senator.\n\nIn testimony that could help the defense, Sellinger said he never felt Menendez pressured him to do anything improper, and Uribe said he never discussed Nadine Menendez's car payments with Bob Menendez.\n\nBut prosecutors will ask jurors to use common sense to make inferences about Menendez's knowledge, said Allon Lifshitz, a former federal prosecutor who is not involved in the case. Those inferences include that Menendez knew discussing individual cases with prosecutors was inappropriate, and that because he and his wife shared details of their lives, they must have discussed the bribes, said Lifshitz, now a partner at law firm Cohen & Gresser.\n\n\"The prosecution will stand up and tell the jury that when Mrs. Menendez asks the senator to do favors for people in her life, he had to know that at the same time she was receiving the Mercedes, the gold bars and the mortgage payments,\" Lifshitz said.",

        "title": "Biden's shaky debate has overseas allies bracing for Trump return By Reuters",
        "body": "By David Dolan and Heekyong Yang\n\nTOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) -While the first U.S. presidential debate of the 2024 race dwelled little on foreign policy, a shaky performance by President Joe Biden will have America's allies steeling for the return of Donald Trump, analysts say.\n\nBiden's supporters had hoped the debate would erase worries that he was too old to serve, but several lawmakers, analysts and investors said the event had given Trump a boost.\n\n\"Mr. Trump didn't win but Mr. Biden might have imploded,\" said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think tank.\n\n\"Unlike eight years ago, we are much more prepared, as are other European and Asian allies. Still, Mr. Trump is unpredictable.\"\n\nFor Japan and South Korea, among the closest U.S. allies in Asia, relations with Trump's administration were at times strained by his demands for more payments towards military assistance as well as trade tensions.\n\n\"The biggest question for Japan would be whether Trump will truly value and maintain the security alliance,\" said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Japan's Takushoku University in Tokyo.\n\nPeter Lee, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said the debate had put into \"much more stark relief\" the possibility of a second Trump administration. Lee said he expected Trump to be \"very tough\" second time around in pressuring allies to up their defence spending.\n\nTrump also started a tariff war with China, the world's second largest economy, and has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods if he wins the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOverseas firms dependent on U.S. markets, such as automakers, would also be wary of the heightened possibility of Trump's return given the \"myriad\" of tariff-related policies he imposed during his previous term, said Lee Jae-il, analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.\n\n\"Trump, like a trade war maniac, might not just target China but impose tariffs against other countries as well under the concept of American exceptionalism,\" added Stephen Lee, chief economist at Meritz Securities in Seoul.\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE\n\nIn Europe, Trump's criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and demands that other members pay more dominated his previous administration. His scepticism towards NATO is causing further anxiety this time, as Russian's war in Ukraine has brought conflict to the bloc's doorstep.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz previously cheered on Biden's prospects for re-election. But on Friday a senior defence figure in the ruling coalition lamented Biden's performance and urged Democrats to find another candidate.\n\n\"The fact that a man like Trump could become president again because the Democrats are unable to put up a strong candidate against him would be a historic tragedy that the whole world would feel,\" Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the liberal FDP party, told the Rheinische Post paper.\n\nA spokesperson for Scholz did not comment on the specifics of the debate, but stressed the chancellor valued Biden highly and that Scholz had never spoken to Trump as their terms did not overlap.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump accused Biden of not standing up to China on trade. He also said China's Xi Jinping, North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin \"don't respect\" Biden and that he was driving the country \"into World War Three\".\n\nBiden retorted by saying Trump's tariff proposals would result in higher costs for American consumers, and that he \"cuddles up\" to the likes of Kim and Putin.\n\nPutin has said it made little difference to Russia who was in the White House, and on Friday the Kremlin declined comment on what it said was an internal U.S. matter.\n\nU.S. allies including Japan and Germany have in any case started laying the groundwork for a possible Trump return in recent months.\n\n\"The possibility of a Trump comeback may have increased. High tariffs and support for Ukraine will also bring about major changes,\" said Kazuhiro Maeshima from the Sophia University in Tokyo.\n\n\"The Japanese government has also been anticipating various developments in the event of a Trump and has been gradually taking steps to deal with them, including making contact with people close to Trump.\"\n\n'TRUMP 2.0'\n\nIn Sydney, several Australian officials and experts had attended a workshop titled \"Trump 2.0\" as the debate was aired.\n\n\"The overwhelming feeling from today is that it was a disaster for Biden,\" said Peter Dean, a professor at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney who was at the workshop.\n\n\"The mood has changed considerably after the debate and the general view is that if you weren't preparing for a Trump 2.0 then that is the smart play and the smart move now.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour party and the frontrunner in an election due next week, was asked on BBC radio if he was concerned about Biden after the debate.\n\n\"I've got enough on my hands with our own election campaign at the moment...The relationship between the UK and the US is strong, it's historic, and obviously, it's above the individuals,\" he said.",
        "summary": "Biden's supporters had hoped the debate would erase worries that he was too old to serve, but several lawmakers, analysts and investors said the event had given Trump a boost.\nLee said he expected Trump to be \"very tough\" second time around in pressuring allies to up their defence spending.\nDuring the debate, Trump accused Biden of not standing up to China on trade.\nU.S. allies including Japan and Germany have in any case started laying the groundwork for a possible Trump return in recent months.\n'TRUMP 2.0'In Sydney, several Australian officials and experts had attended a workshop titled \"Trump 2.0\" as the debate was aired.",

Rapp (\"CJ\"), is with New to The Street's TV host Jane King. From the New York Stock Exchange Studio, they talk about the fundamental ongoings and history of Karma Water and its patented \"Karma Push-Cap\" technology, which instantaneously infuses water with natural flavoring, probiotics, and vitamins. CJ has succeeded in the beverage sector and founded Jolt Cola (\"JOLT\"), a well-known beverage brand. The idea for Karma Water comes from the industry shortfalls related to pre-mixed, water-soluble vitamins/nutrients in current beverage products. These products are sometimes hotly mixed and then sit on shelves, exposed to climate conditions, and over time, the wellness benefits become significantly reduced. The FDA has acted on this issue, stating that labeling needs to be more accurate on pre-mixed products due to time-related reduced optimization benefits. So, ten years ago, CJ started Karma Water, which continues to grow brand awareness, increase retail locations, expand online orders, and educate consumers. The Company collaborates with Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), Inc., a large Fortune 500 Company, and CJ believes this relationship will increase Karma's brand identity. CJ doesn't expect to go public directly, but if the relationship with Constellation proves successful, perhaps Constellation will acquire the Company. CJ demonstrates the product on air, showing how immediately the bottled water is infused with natural flavor and vitamin mix.

        "title": "After dramatic tax win, Kenya's young protesters plot next moves By Reuters",
        "body": "By Aaron Ross and Giulia Paravicini\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - After their stunning success forcing the government to shelve $2.7 billion in tax hikes, young Kenyan activists are setting their sights higher, taking aim at deeply ingrained corruption and misgovernance.\n\nProtesters say the finance bill President William Ruto abandoned on Wednesday was only a symptom of the problems plaguing a country where many young people face dwindling job prospects despite strong economic growth.\n\nThe movement has little precedent in its mass mobilisation of Kenyans across ethnic and regional divisions while rejecting any kind of political leadership. Protests in Kenya have historically been led by elites, often ending in power-sharing deals that yielded few tangible benefits for demonstrators.\n\nProtesters now face the challenge of maintaining unity and momentum while pursuing broader, less immediate goals. They will also have to decide how to respond to Ruto's offer of dialogue, which the president made on Wednesday without offering specifics.\n\nWriter and activist Nanjala Nyabola said most of those involved in the recent protests were motivated by legitimate, strongly held grievances with the government.\n\n\"Until those grievances are addressed, it's unlikely that they're going to be willing to make concessions.\"\n\nHow the diffuse and leaderless movement, which largely organised via social media, pursues its objectives moving forward remains an open question - and a source of internal debate.\n\nChristine Odera, co-chair of the Kenya Coalition on Youth, Peace and Security, a civil society organisation, said there was a need for it to develop more formalised structures to advance the interests of young people and speak to the government.\n\n\"If we go organically then we might lose the whole conversation,\" said Odera, who participated in the protests. \"The president has said we need to have conversations. All of us cannot sit in a stadium and have a conversation.\"\n\nOthers strongly disagree.\n\nOjango Omondi, a member of the Social Justice Centres Working Group, a community activist group in a poor district of Nairobi, said creating formal structures and designating national representatives could let the movement be corrupted by politicians.\n\n\"We don't need to negotiate anything,\" he said. \"All we want is better living conditions. All we want is the leaders to stop using our resources ... to sponsor their lavish lifestyle.\"\n\nQUESTION OF UNITY\n\nOmondi said there was plenty to keep the past week's protesters engaged - from organising funerals for the nearly two dozen people killed in clashes with police on Tuesday to forcing recall elections against members of parliament.\n\nAnother key moment could be the government's next bid to pass a finance bill, which is needed to fund expenditures in the upcoming fiscal year. Some protesters suspect the government will still try to jam through tax raises.\n\nIn a country where ethnic affinities have traditionally been a key driver of protest, the current youth-driven demonstrations have stood out for building unity around common grievances.\n\nBut cracks are already emerging.\n\nDespite Ruto's U-turn on the tax hikes, some protesters called for a planned march on the presidential residence to go ahead on Thursday in an attempt to force the president from power. Others rejected the idea as a dangerous gambit.\n\nIn the end, there were protests in several cities, although they were smaller than on Tuesday.\n\nIn Ruto's hometown and political stronghold of Eldoret, where thousands from different ethnic groups took to the streets on Tuesday, a human rights activist said some tensions were resurfacing since the president withdrew the bill.\n\nNicholas Omito, CEO of the Centre for Human Rights and Mediation, said demonstrators from Ruto's Kalenjin ethnic group were arguing that protests should end now that the bill was dropped. Ethnic Kikuyu demonstrators were insisting they should continue until Ruto resigned.\n\nNyabola, the writer, conceded that the solidarity on display as Kenyans across all walks of life took to the streets in the bold showdown with their government could not undo the country's long history of ethnic division.\n\n\"You're never going to get rid of it completely,\" she said. \"But for now the class and wealth disparity between politicians and ordinary people has been the focus.\"",

        "title": "Fluence Energy: An Underappreciated AI Data Center Play (NASDAQ:FLNC)",
        "body": "funky-data\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nInvestors are underestimating the demand impact for renewables from AI data centers. Companies like Amazon and Meta committed to 100% renewable power procure additional renewable electricity at an inverse proportion to the renewable percentage of the electric grids in which they operate. I believe this is potentially a massive amount of incremental renewable power demand and will be a share price driver. Fluence Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLNC) has positive exposure and is positioned to be a large beneficiary with continued margin improvement. Buy.\n\nHow 100% Renewable Energy Is Achieved\n\nWhen it comes to renewable energy stocks, one of the most common pushbacks is that renewables can't provide the reliable power data centers need, especially with AI workload growing exponentially. However, achieving 100% renewable target may not be the same as some investors expect it to be. Renewables in general, can\u2019t provide reliable power to Apple\u2019s retail stores, or Amazon\u2019s warehouses, or Meta's Metaverse, or Google\u2019s data centers. Yet, Apple has claimed 100% renewable sourcing since 2018, Amazon 90% in 2022, Meta 100% since 2020, Google 100% since 2017.\n\nCorporate renewable targets are largely met by corporate procurement of Power Purchase Agreements (C-PPAs) in which the corporate agrees to buy the power generated from utility-scale solar and/or wind projects equal to their total annual nonrenewable electricity consumption. That renewable electricity is then resold by the corporate off-taker into the grid for general consumption by all customers. Apple explained how it works quite well in its 2015 sustainability report.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to power our facilities with onsite renewable energy, we match our load with renewable energy generated by either Apple-owned projects or third-party projects. We put the clean energy we generate onto the local grid, displacing the more polluting forms of energy. The best way to think about it is like a bank: You can deposit $20 in one bank branch, then go to another branch and withdraw $20. Renewable energy works in a similar way. And Apple\u2019s renewable energy approach goes a step further to make sure we \"deposit\" on the same grid as the energy we are \"withdrawing.\"\n\nThis is how Google is doing it now and how they plan to do it by 2030.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s renewable energy methodology is a custom calculation and is based on a global approach. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendaryear basis, dividing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations by the total volume of electricity consumed by our global operations. The numerator includes all renewable energy procured, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. We set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day.\n\nAccording to UBS, total US utility-scale solar installations were 77GW 5-years ending 2023, of which signed solar C-PPAs were 64GW or over 80% of installs. Although PPAs are not necessarily signed in the same year as installs, the above numbers should show how significant the magnitude is.\n\nBloomberg\n\nUBS also projects that there will be around 175TWh of incremental load growth from AI data centers by 2030, in addition to the previously forecast 175TWh from regular data centers, totaling 350TWh, fully met by renewables (80% solar, 20% wind). With that said, the amount of power generated by renewables is still not enough to meet the increased demand for energy, evidenced by the fact that 60% of the electricity at utility scale was still generated by dirty sources in 2023 for the US. This creates a backlog of demand, extending the duration of demand visibility and I expect stocks exposed to this demand to go higher due to more certainty and greater long-term demand growth.\n\nThe Set-up\n\nWhat I like about the renewables set-up is that the starting point of the sentiment around this sector is so low following a downward stock price trajectory since the peak in January 2021 and an underperformance YTD (TAN down ~19% vs SPX up ~15%). Alt Energy ETF fund flows have been consistently negative since last year until last month. This period of negative outflows coincided with a 44% decline in the TAN ETF before the tick-up in May. I believe the outflows reflect a mix of increasing interest rates/rate volatility and election uncertainty. With the small positive inflow in May, achieving 2-3 months in a row would be a signal that investor sentiment or positioning is shifting, potentially signaling the early stages of the next renewables investment cycle, in my opinion.\n\nLipper\n\nStock performance last year was highly negatively correlated with interest rates, but having reached a relatively more stable level YTD, I see the elevated correlation starting to weaken. In my view, this implies more opportunity for investors to be rewarded more by individual stock picking than by broader sector exposure decisions as was the case during 2023. Within utility scale, interest rate impacts have been mitigated by higher PPA pricing supported by strong offtaker demand for renewable energy, although volatility in the rate environment has likely driven some investment decisions to be delayed.\n\nMonthly performance correlation, selected stocks' average (LSEG) TAN & 10-year Treasury yield (LSEG)\n\nHow FLNC Can Benefit\n\nRecognizing the importance of the US electric grid in driving emissions reduction, in December 2021 as part of Executive Order 14008 \u2013 Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad \u2013 President Biden signed an executive order which sets a goal for a carbon pollution-free electricity sector no later than 2035. The Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provide additional support to help drive a more rapid transition. With this backdrop and what is discussed above, I think FLNC is well positioned to benefit from strong growing secular demand for utility-scale battery energy storage and declining battery costs, as battery energy storage system (BESS) is an essential enabler of renewable energy generation.\n\nBloomberg McKinsey & Company Battery input prices ($/t) (LSEG)\n\nTo explain further, the demand impact for FLNC is not physically at data centers. Rather, it's created by the 100% renewable mandates and price volatility arbitrage. FLNC is a battery integrator that brings together hardware suppliers (batteries) and construction (EPCs) in order to deliver to the end customer (developer, IPP, etc) a finished utility-scale battery system, and here is what motivates demand for its battery systems.\n\nDeregulated electricity markets are not altruistic. Investors generally deploy capital to earn a financial return sufficient for the risk to those returns, and being able to \"help\" integrate renewables is just a side effect in my opinion. The total amount of the potential arbitrage profit is directly related to the demand for batteries including FLNC\u2019s systems. This is how it will play out:\n\nIncreasing solar capacity on the grid depresses daytime electricity prices.\n\nBuying electricity during the day and reselling electricity at higher night time prices creates positive revenue.\n\nAn energy storage system is needed to exploit this price or time difference.\n\nThe size of the total arbitrage opportunity is measured by:\n\nwidth of the price spread the volume that can be run through this spread\n\nData center electricity demand growth increases both factors through the mechanism of 100% renewable targets. Granted, arbitrage is not the only way batteries can make a financial return, but it is an important one.\n\nFLNC's Recent Performance and Valuation\n\nFLNC reported 2Q revenue of $623.1 million, beating consensus estimates of $531 million, mainly driven by accelerated project timing. Adjusted gross margins of 10.6% were largely in line with estimates, while adj EBITDA of -$6.1 million was slightly ahead of the expected -$7.61 million. Margin expansion was fueled by a higher-margin product mix. Management reaffirmed FY24 guidance with revenue projected between $2.7-3.3 billion, $50-80 million adjusted EBITDA, and $80 million FY24 recurring revenue, with 90% of FY24 revenue guidance already in the backlog.\n\nOrder intake was about $713 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of ~1.1x, the tenth consecutive quarter of larger than 1.0x. The contracted backlog for Products was 5.3 GW, up ~200MW from the last quarter. Services was 3.6 GW, up ~100MW q/q, and Digital was 6.9 GW, up 1.2 GW q/q. The total pipeline increased to $16.3 billion, up 22% or $2.9 billion q/q.\n\nUnder a robust market backdrop of declining battery prices and increasing energy storage demand driven by need for grid resiliency, and a pipeline of opportunity now exceeding 16.3 billion and contracted backlog of $3.7 billion, I see the FY24 guidance and FY25 revenue growth target of 35% as readily attainable.\n\nThe below model is used to derive the price target for the stock.\n\nA 34% revenue growth in FY24 based on management's guide of $3 billion mid-point and street estimates, and a CAGR of 30% through FY26, expecting it to grow at the same speed as the market growth predicted by McKinsey & Company.\n\nGross margin of 12% based on management's target of 10-12% in FY2024. I believe the high end of the guidance is achievable due to a drop in battery input prices.\n\nOpex growth not more than 50% of revenue growth based on management's guidance.\n\nTarget price is based on an assigned multiple of 14x my FY26 EBITDA estimate, discounted back one-year.\n\nThe assigned multiple largely aligns with the average forward trading multiple since the company\u2019s fiscal 2023 year-end in September 2023.\n\nAs a result, the implied target price for the stock is $22 per share, representing 18% upside and 30% below current consensus.\n\nMarket Gems\n\nDownside Risks:\n\n1. FLNC\u2019s revenue is almost entirely generated by energy storage products, and the main driver is companies' mandates on using renewable energy, which is an uncertain factor itself. If there is reduced demand for energy storage products, or if deployment of renewable energy is slower than expected, demand for FLNC\u2019s battery energy storage hardware and software services could be negatively impacted, leading to negative share performance.\n\n2. FLNC\u2019s sales depend on a relatively concentrated customer base. In fiscal year 2023, its top 2 customers accounted for 49% of total revenue. A loss of any significant customer or a reduction in pricing or order volume could have a negative impact on the company's financial results.\n\n3. FLNC sources components and materials from various international vendors including those in China, Korea, and Europe. Interruption of the flow of supply could disrupt FLNC\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers, and significant changes in the costs of raw materials necessary for the company's products could negatively impact its financial results.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering the growth of utility-scale solar installations and AI workload, plus the fact that more and more companies are working towards using 100% renewable energy, I believe FLNC's potential is underappreciated and it is well-positioned to capture this demand with its battery system. My target price for the stock implies 18% upside, but still rather conservative compared to what the street thinks it should be trading at. Buy.",

        "title": "AT&T Shows Red Flags As Stock Nears Recent Peak (NYSE:T)",
        "body": "jetcityimage\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) stock has received a very strong bullish outlook from a majority of analysts on Wall Street in the last few months. Even on Seeking Alpha, the sentiment has been very bullish. In the year to date, there has been only one Sell rating for AT&T stock on Seeking Alpha while there have been dozens of bullish ratings. However, it should be noted that AT&T is a very mature company and its business model is not going to give any new surprises. We have seen Meta (META) give massive returns since hitting the bottom in 2022 with the help of cost cuts and better use of tools to improve ad sales. AT&T cannot do either and any increase in revenue or decrease in expenses would be very modest.\n\nMy previous article in late Novemeber 2023 looked at the positive results of AT&T in that quarter but I gave the stock a Sell rating due to longer-term challenges. Since then, AT&T stock has reported 16.6% total returns which has been overshadowed by the 21% return of S&P500 during that period. AT&T gave a better dividend yield of close to 6.8% when the previous article was published as compared to 6% it gives currently.\n\nInvestors need to question about the future upside potential for AT&T stock after the recent rally. The stock is close to the $20 level which it has not been able to break out of for the last few quarters. Most of the positive news about FCF improvement has been absorbed by Wall Street and it is not clear how the management can give another big positive surprise that can help the stock. I believe the stock could significantly underperform S&P500 in the next few quarters as some of the investors balk at lower dividends and others take out the profits after the recent rally.\n\nAT&T fundamentals are a mixed bag\n\nAT&T's recent first-quarter highlights showed several positive numbers. The postpaid churn metric was quite good at 0.72% and AT&T Fiber net adds was 252,000. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of 200,000+ net adds. The consumer broadband revenue of $2.7 billion was also up by 7.7% year over year.\n\nCompany Filings\n\nFigure: First-quarter highlights of AT&T. Source: Company Filings\n\nCompany Filings\n\nFigure: Low churn rate of AT&T compared to competitors. Source: Company Filings\n\nHowever, all these numbers got hidden behind some of the key metrics like revenue and EPS growth. The forward EPS estimates of AT&T have also fallen which shows that Wall Street does not have a lot of faith in the company's ability to expand the bottom-line.\n\nYcharts\n\nFigure: Key metrics of AT&T in the recent quarter. Source: Ycharts\n\nWe are in a high inflationary environment. AT&T should have been able to show reasonably good revenue growth in this situation. However, the company showed a YoY decline in revenue growth. The EPS also declined by 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. There has also been a significant dip in the EPS estimate for 2 fiscal years ahead.\n\nThe low churn rate in postpaid is certainly important and mobility service growth can be viewed positively. But the core issue is that these factors should move the needle for the core revenue and EPS metric. If this does not happen in the next few quarters, it would be very difficult for AT&T to sustain the current momentum.\n\nThe free cash flow was $3.1 billion, up $2.1 billion YoY. However, this increase has largely been due to a decrease in capital investment instead of an increase in revenue base. Despite these positive numbers in the recent quarter and the previous quarter, the stock is still lagging behind S&P 500 in terms of total returns.\n\nAT&T is still behind S&P500\n\nYcharts\n\nFigure: Total returns of S&P500 and AT&T since the last article. Source: Ycharts\n\nSince my previous thesis in late November 2023, AT&T stock has reported good bullish momentum but it has still lagged behind the broader S&P500 in total returns. The recent rally in AT&T can be looked at as its good fortune where Wall Street has maintained a bullish sentiment overall for the last few quarters. However, the real test will be when this bullish run stops in S&P500. Will AT&T manage to outperform S&P500 after its already long bull run.\n\nA contrarian view might be necessary\n\nAT&T\u2019s business model is very mature and we are not going to see any major surprises unless the management announces imprudent acquisitions similar to last decade. In this highly stable business model, it should be very difficult to have a very bullish sentiment. However, the recent rating by most of the analysts on Wall Street suggests a strong bullish opinion. Even on Seeking Alpha, there has been only one Sell rating year to date out of several dozens of theses published.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nFigure: Recent ratings of analysts on Seeking Alpha. Source: Seeking Alpha\n\nInvestors should retain some contrarian opinion for a mature company like AT&T. This can help them pick up the ideal entry point and avoid getting into the stock at close to its peak.\n\nYcharts\n\nFigure: Comparison of AT&T YoY revenue growth and US inflation. Source: Ycharts\n\nAT&T\u2019s YoY revenue growth has lagged the broader US inflation rate significantly for a long time. This shows that the company does not have the pricing leverage to match the increase in overall living costs. It is unlikely that we will see a change in this trend due to the current competitive environment. This makes it difficult for AT&T to deliver revenue growth which can cause a big inflection in stock price.\n\nStock reaching close to its peak\n\nYcharts\n\nFigure: AT&T stock price movement in the last few years. Source: Ycharts\n\nOver the last three years, AT&T stock has not been able to break out of the $20-$21 level upper limit. It is possible that the stock becomes less attractive for dividend investors at $20 range which limits any further bullish rally in the stock. After the recent bullish run, AT&T stock is very close to $20 upper range. As mentioned above, it is highly unlikely that the management can show big surprise in some key metrics which can help the stock continue with its bullish run.\n\nInvestors looking for a big inflection point for AT&T might be disappointed. The dividend yield is already very close to 6% and could soon fall below this level. The management had earlier announced that they would focus on reducing debt. This limits the possibility of a dividend hike as the company is already paying over $8 billion in dividends.\n\nAfter the recent bullish run, AT&T will find it very difficult to exceed or even match S&P500 returns over the next few quarters which makes the stock a Sell at the current price.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nSince my last thesis in late 2023, AT&T stock has shown 16.6% total returns but this has been beaten by S&P500 which showed 21% total returns during this time. Even during one of the best bullish runs by the stock, it has not been able to match the returns of the broader index. An overwhelming number of analysts are bullish over AT&T which can be seen as a warning sign for a mature company like AT&T. We are highly unlikely to see any surprises from AT&T in terms of revenue growth or profitability due to its business model.\n\nThe stock is already close to its recent peak of $20 and the dividend yield will likely dip below 6% making the stock less attractive to dividend investors. While the recent bullish rally has been promising I believe caution is required at the current price. These factors make the stock a Sell.",

        "body": "ArtistGNDphotography\n\nZeo investment thesis\n\nSolar installer Zeo Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:ZEO) is a relative newcomer to the Nasdaq exchange. It is a promising addition, since it has had several years of operations under a predecessor company, and it is profitable.\n\nIt is implementing new revenue generating initiatives, including expansion into two more states and ramping up its sales force. Zeo also enjoys the tailwinds supporting renewable energy, and reports that some of its headwinds, such as interest rates, are dissipating.\n\nGreen investors will find Zeo an interesting prospect, but most investors should wait for another couple of quarters, to ensure its financial metrics are headed upward. I rate the firm a Hold.\n\nHistory and business of Zeo\n\nNasdaq newcomer Zeo Energy Corporation began trading on March 14, after a business combination involving Sunergy Renewables LLC and ESGEN Acquisition Corp. (ESGEN). The two companies merged into Zeo, which is being led by Sunergy\u2019s senior management.\n\nThe company specializes in the installation of residential solar energy systems, as well as related energy efficiency equipment, and services. Geographically, it operates in Florida (which was Sunergy\u2019s base), Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Illinois (the latter two opened in the first quarter of this year). It sells and installs solar panels, inverters, and racking systems. In addition, it offers insulation services.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, its shares were trading at $2.43, and it had a market cap of $130.9 million.\n\nCompetition for solar installations\n\nZeo points to a wide range of competitors in its June 3, 2024 prospectus. It considers electric utilities to be its primary competitors, as they compete for customers based on price. Other criteria include reliability and environmental benefits.\n\nThe list also includes retail electric providers and independent power producers that are not regulated like the utilities. In addition, there are community solar products from municipal power companies, and other solar energy companies.\n\nAs for specific companies, Sunergy compared itself to Sunrun Inc. (RUN), Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA), and Sunpower Corporation (SPWR) in ESGEN/Sunergy\u2019s investor presentation in November 2023:\n\nZEO competitors (Zeo November 2023 investor presentation)\n\nFive-year revenue charts for these companies plus Sunergy/Zeo show the latter is much smaller by revenue than the other four:\n\nZEO competitors by revenue (SeekingAlpha )\n\nCompetitive advantages: Zeo management argues in its June 3 prospectus that it has strengths, which also might be interpreted as competitive advantages:\n\nIts business is profitable and has increased revenue and earned profits over the past four years.\n\nIt claims its sales model generates a high volume of sales per representative and low customer acquisition costs.\n\nZeo\u2019s vertical integration is believed to produce customer satisfaction and personnel retention.\n\nA scalable business platform allows it to grow efficiently.\n\nRegarding the sales model, it has four tiers, beginning with door-to-door staff; their leads are passed up to the second tier and so on until reaching the top salespeople on tier four.\n\nOne way of testing such competitive advantage claims is to compare margins. First quarter 2024 results show its three rivals failed to deliver positive EBITDA or net income, and thus had negative margins:\n\nZEO gross, EBITDA, and net margins (author)\n\nZeo hasn't just been profitable in the first quarter, it also delivered profits in each of the past three years (before it went public). In contrast, Sunrun has had negative EBITDA and net income through the past 10 years, and Sunnova has been negative for seven years. Sunpower did post positive EBITDA until 2023, while its net income has been negative every year since 2018.\n\nComments: The data confirms the belief that Zeo does have a competitive advantage in at least this one area.\n\nProfitability positions it well for future growth and to become the market leader. It provides free cash flow that can be reinvested; it also makes it easier to raise capital through equity or debt.\n\nDespite being the smallest in terms of revenue, profitability makes Zeo a better choice for many investors.\n\nManagement and strategy at Zeo\n\nTimothy Bridgewater is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and a director of Zeo. He joined a Sunergy predecessor in 2019 as CEO, CFO, and Chairman of the Board. Previously, he had founded and managed Interlink Capital Strategies, an investment advisory service. He is also Managing Partner at Prometheus Power Partners, a solar energy development company.\n\nZeo\u2019s strategy focuses on growth, and in its Prospectus said it wants to \u201cincrease our market impact and grow our revenue and profits by pursuing the following strategic objectives:\u201d\n\nExpand into new geographic markets, states where it does not yet have a presence.\n\nEmphasize efficient growth by training its own staff and external dealers.\n\nKeep expanding the external dealer sales channel.\n\nProvide new financing options, such as leasing, and growing its roofing business. Customers often want new roofing before installing solar panels, so having its own roofing company helps speed up solar sales.\n\nComments: CEO Bridgewater has more than 30 years\u2019 experience in financial and solar businesses. While he currently has a heavy load, handling both the CEO and CFO duties, he should be able to lead the company forward.\n\nThe growth strategy seems reasonable, since it builds on the trend toward renewable energy. I also like the idea that it is focused on incremental growth, rather than making a big bet on a new strategy and tactics. Finally, the choice of a capital-light business model is a smart one, since it will require much less capital or debt financing.\n\nRevenue and net income growth\n\nLooking at a chart of Zeo\u2019s revenue and net income, one fact jumps out: Net income, and ultimately earnings per share, took a deep dive while revenue continued to increase:\n\nZEO revenue and net income chart (SeekingAlpha )\n\nHowever, the company expressed optimism in its Q1-2024 earnings release that it would again increase its profitability. One reason for that bullishness is that it is getting past the general and administrative costs that go with a business combination, rebranding, and public listing.\n\nCEO Bridgewater said, \u201cWith transaction costs from our successful business combination behind us, we expect that our profitability will return to historical levels of growth throughout the remainder of the year as well.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that Zeo is well positioned for the second and third quarters (the fourth is typically slower because there is less demand in winter). He observed that headwinds such as equipment pricing and high-interest rates are dissipating, and early indications suggest it will have a strong sales force out this spring and summer.\n\nAs a renewables company, Zeo and its predecessor, Sunery has several tailwinds propelling its growth (and that of its competitors, too):\n\nZEO industry market trends (November investor presentation)\n\nIt released its first quarter report on May 15, and the metrics included (all comparisons with Q1-2023):\n\nTotal revenue increased 4% to $19.5 million.\n\nGross profit went down by 47% to $1.8 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.2 million, compared to a profit of $2.0 million.\n\nThe company also noted that its merger transaction costs totaled $11.7 million, a substantial sum for a company with relatively little revenue.\n\nComments: Zeo is growing and from the second quarter onward should register increasing net income again. Its expansion into Ohio and Illinois in the first quarter should add additional revenue, although we don\u2019t know if it will be immediately profitable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the key here. Revenue has been on a predictable, upward trajectory, while EBITDA and net income fell because of the business combination, the public listing, and other costs. With those expenses behind them, the company has no excuse for not increasing its net margin and income.\n\nValuation\n\nZeo\u2019s short history as a publicly traded stock has not been a happy one for shareholders. Since mid-March, the share price has kept falling:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nEven the optimistic tone of the first quarter earnings report did not arouse any enthusiasm. Of course, if we look at the trajectory of net income, including when it was known as Sunergy, there is little to encourage investors:\n\nZEO net income chart (SeekingAlpha )\n\nThe CEO indicated in the first quarter 2024 report that additional SG&A costs were now in the past, and that he expected better times in the second and third quarters of this year. Based on its expansion into two new states, a bigger sales force, and a reduction in SG&A expenses, I expect higher EBITDA and net income margins.\n\nOn valuation, Zeo has a price/sales ratio of 0.15, which is low; it's named rivals have varying ratios, but all are higher than Zeo\u2019s. Sunnova\u2019s is 0.95 and gets an A rating, Sunrun is at 1.33 which earns it a C+ rating, and SunPower receives an A for its 0.28. Based on its rivals\u2019 grades, I would suggest Zeo would be rated as an A or A+.\n\nAs such, investors would pay less for each dollar of Zeo sales, and the stock is thus undervalued. There are no P/E measures for the named rivals, since none of them have positive earnings.\n\nWhile those measures indicate Zeo is undervalued, we have to add that the shares outstanding count rose from one million at the end of December to just over five million by the end of March:\n\nZEO shares outstanding chart (SeekingAlpha)\n\nA return to historical levels would suggest earnings per share of $6.23 (2023 EPS) divided by 5 (5 million shares now versus 1 million shares last year) = $1.25. On that basis, I would consider the shares overvalued.\n\nIt appears that investors are taking the share price down toward $1.25. Zeo has been shedding value almost every day since it went public on March 15. I expect it will continue to do so until getting close to that point.\n\nSumming up, it\u2019s more logical to think the price is being whittled back to absorb the five-fold increase in the share count than to assess it by its price/sales ratio. Therefore, I put the fair price at $1.25.\n\nNevertheless, I think Zeo holds promise as a growth stock; it has, after all, delivered profits where its rivals have not, and is implementing initiatives that should grow at least its revenue. For now, though, I rate it a Hold. There are no other ratings yet.\n\nRisk factors for Zeo investors\n\nThis is a small company with a share price that has declined since it began trading publicly. It is profitable now, but prudent investors will wait for continued, profitable growth in at least the second and third quarters.\n\nAs a growth company with ambitious plans, don\u2019t be surprised if the company issues significant numbers of new shares, which would dilute current shareholders. Similarly, it has issued warrants that might be exercised. Over time, this dilution should be offset by higher revenue and net income.\n\nThe price of residential energy is determined by electrical utilities, and significant reductions by them could make renewables less attractive, thus undermining Zeo\u2019s business.\n\nThe company depends on, in the words of the June prospectus, \u201cthe availability of utility rebates, tax credits and other benefits, tax exemptions and exclusions, and other financial incentives on the federal, state, and/or local levels that may be adversely affected by changes in, and application of these laws or other incentives to Zeo, and the expiration, elimination or reduction of these benefits could adversely impact Zeo\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nZeo has identified what it calls \u201cmaterial weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.\u201d That\u2019s why its 10-K for 2023 had to be amended. If it is unable to resolve these weaknesses or new weaknesses appear in the future, investors will be unable to depend on its financial reports.\n\nConclusion\n\nI expect that Zeo Energy will emerge as an attractive growth stock later this year, opening another door for investors seeking green names. The company is expanding into more states and has put behind it the costs connected with its business combination and going public.\n\nHowever, it is also a relatively young company, and future profits are uncertain. I would like to see two more quarters of profitable growth, and until then, rate it a Hold.\n\nEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

        "title": "Apple Stock: This Could Be Another Bubble (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "body": "ozgurdonmaz\n\nApple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) entrance into the generative AI field made the market excited about the company\u2019s future, as the business\u2019s shares have greatly appreciated in recent weeks. While there\u2019s no denying that the launch of Apple Intelligence could certainly help the company improve its ecosystem, there are questions about whether the potential upside from generative AI tools will be able to justify the current valuation and offset macro risks that have been negatively affecting the business in recent quarters. Considering this, it makes sense to believe that Apple\u2019s shares could\u2019ve entered a bubble territory since the number of challenges that the company faces continues to increase, while the business\u2019s entrance into the generative AI field doesn\u2019t guarantee successful mitigation of major risks.\n\nAll Eyes On AI\n\nBack in February, I wrote an article about Apple where I highlighted the company\u2019s vulnerable position in the Chinese market, where its sales were decreasing and negatively affecting the performance of the overall business. Since that time, Apple\u2019s shares have appreciated by ~17% primarily thanks to the recent announcement of the upcoming launch of its AI system known as Apple Intelligence, which made the market excited about the company\u2019s future.\n\nApple\u2019s entrance into the generative AI field is certainly a major milestone for the company. At the very least, it could help Apple revive growth that\u2019s much needed at this stage, as the company has been experiencing a Y/Y decline in revenues in some of its recent quarters. Even in the Q2 earnings report, which was released last month, Apple reported that its revenues declined by 4.3% Y/Y to $90.8 billion primarily due to the weak performance of its iPhone business which experienced an 11.7% Y/Y decline in revenues to $45.96 billion.\n\nBy offering several AI-centric tools and platforms, Apple at the very least won\u2019t be left behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), which launched their own AI tools a while ago and have already experienced a boost in sales recently. In addition to providing new AI writing tools and giving its voice assistant Siri a new AI-centric upgrade, the ability of Apple Intelligence to integrate across various apps and help users better navigate across those apps with the help of simple prompts could become one of the biggest selling points of the company\u2019s AI system.\n\nWhile Apple Intelligence itself is going to be free and incorporated into iOS, it could prompt consumers to stick with or join the company\u2019s ecosystem, which in the end could lead to the overall sales rise of the business. At the same time, the company\u2019s partnership with OpenAI could also prompt consumers to stick with Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe market has already positively reacted to all of those developments, as we saw Apple\u2019s shares greatly appreciating in recent weeks on record volume, and there are already talks about the company reaching a $4 trillion valuation within a year thanks to its latest AI offerings.\n\nApple's Stock Performance (Seeking Alpha)\n\nAre We in a Bubble Territory?\n\nThe biggest challenge at this stage is to figure out whether Apple Intelligence presents enough upside to justify the current valuation and mitigate the challenges that the company currently faces.\n\nJust a few months ago, Samsung overtook Apple as the biggest smartphone seller across the globe. It happened due to the fact that Apple has had the worst performance in China since 2020 as its iPhone sales declined by 19% despite the firm\u2019s efforts to lure new customers by offering significant discounts for its phones at the start of this year. As of now, the competition in China is increasing as domestic alternatives continue to gain traction on the mainland, which makes it harder for Apple to revive growth there. Given that it\u2019s unlikely that Apple\u2019s upcoming AI offerings will be fully available in China, since ChatGPT is not functioning, there and there are calls to limit the use of American-made AI models in China, it\u2019s hard to see how the company will be able to revive growth in one of the biggest consumer markets in the world. Add to all of this the fact that Apple Intelligence is unlikely to be launched in the European Union this year and it becomes even harder to see how the company\u2019s AI offerings should help greatly boost the overall sales in the foreseeable future.\n\nConsidering all of this, it all comes down to whether the growth opportunities outweigh the downside of owning Apple\u2019s shares at the current price to justify a long position right now. After all, by trading at over 30 times its forward earnings, Apple could be considered overvalued against the broader market that trades at lower multiples.\n\nTo figure out whether Apple\u2019s stock has any upside in the current environment, I created a DCF model where the revenue assumptions for the following years closely correlate with the overall consensus. While in FY24, which ends in September, the growth in revenues is expected to be minimal, the growth is projected to accelerate in FY25 and beyond, as new iPhones are released and the positive effect from new AI offerings primarily in North America starts to boost the overall sales.\n\nThe EBIT assumptions closely correlate with Apple\u2019s historical performance and are expected to gradually increase in the following years as margins could slowly improve thanks to the company\u2019s entrance into the generative AI field. The assumptions for the rest of the metrics in the model closely correlate with Apple\u2019s historical performance. The WACC in the model stands at 8%, which is close to the market\u2019s average cost of capital rate, while the terminal growth rate in the model stands at 3%.\n\nApple's DCF Model (Historical Data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author)\n\nThis model shows that Apple\u2019s fair value is $176.30 per share, which represents a downside of ~17%. Therefore, despite all the growth opportunities that Apple Intelligence seems to offer to the overall business, the company\u2019s shares could potentially be in the bubble territory after the recent rapid appreciation.\n\nApple's DCF Model (Historical Data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEven though Apple\u2019s entrance into the generative AI field is a positive development, there are still a lot of questions that are left unanswered. While the company\u2019s AI offerings look promising, and I will definitely use them myself on my iOS devices, it seems that at the current price, the upside of holding Apple\u2019s shares is minimal and the margin of safety is almost non-existent. Despite the market\u2019s enthusiasm in recent weeks, it\u2019s still hard to see how Apple will revive growth in China and significantly improve its performance in Europe, given the roadblocks that its AI offerings face in those markets.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s always a possibility that the positive effects of those AI offerings in North America and other markets could be enough to revive growth within the company and make the assumptions in my model look too conservative. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sticking with my rating of HOLD for Apple\u2019s shares for now.",

        "title": "RSSY: An Interesting Stocks And Futures Yield ETF",
        "body": "wildpixel\n\nThe global derivatives market is growing rapidly, with new products launched at a steady cadence. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the notional value of all OTC derivatives in 2023 stood at $667 trillion, growing 8% over the prior year. Why is this relevant to the average retail investor in the U.S.? The main reason, I believe, is that it provides much broader investment opportunities that were heretofore only available to institutional investors with hundreds of millions in managed funds.\n\nToday, that picture is very different, and this reality is marked by the rise of increasingly new ways in which an investor can deploy their funds. One such interesting study is the Return Stacked\u00ae U.S. Stocks & Futures Yield ETF (BATS:RSSY), which is the subject of our discussion today. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.04%, which is quite reasonable, in my opinion, and the AUM is a little shy of $130 million as I write this.\n\nHow Does the ETF Make Money?\n\nThe fund essentially follows two key strategies. The first is the simple act of investing in U.S. large-cap stocks, and the second is a more complex approach that takes advantage of futures yields across multiple segments, including currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities. According to the fund's website, the ETF:\n\nAims to provide simultaneous exposure to U.S. stocks and a futures yield strategy. For every $1 invested, RSSY aims to provide $1 of exposure to large-cap U.S. equities and $1 of exposure to a futures yield strategy.\n\nThis futures yield component of the strategy is interesting, because the fund rebalances daily, and the futures contracts can be any mix of the above underlying assets, but it also involves both long and short positions. The end result is the fund's ability to \"harvest\" the roll yield or roll return, which is calculated as follows:\n\nRoll yield = (total change in futures prices) - (total change in spot price)\n\nNow, this is different from a dividend yield or a fixed income yield (such as a bond's YTM or yield to maturity), but it essentially has the same effect of complementing the core return from the changing price of the underlying asset - whether that's a bond, a commodity, an equity, or a currency pair.\n\nRSSY, therefore, can be said to use a strategy that not only directly benefits from an equity's price gain or loss, but adds a couple of layers on top of that - the price change in the underlying assets and the roll yield.\n\nThe mechanics are more complex than that, of course, but the essence of it is that when long-dated contracts are priced higher than short-dated contracts (contango), the roll return is negative, while the inverse is true when the futures curve is in backwardation, which is the exact opposite and longer-dated contracts are priced lower than short-dated contracts. This second situation can happen when the commodity, such as soy, sugar, gold, corn, etc., faces short-term shortages that aren't expected to be repeated the following year. Therefore, the total return for the fund comprises the price appreciation/depreciation component of the equities and futures contracts and the yield or roll return component of the contracts.\n\nThe best part about this is that you don't need to understand any of this if you're investing in an ETF that does the job for you. So, that now begs the question: how has this fund performed so far?\n\nIs it worth considering RSSY for your portfolio?\n\nUnfortunately, since the fund is only a little over a month old, we don't have robust historicals. However, looking at the past month's total return of 5.52% against (SP500)'s 3.5%, I'd say it's off to a great start.\n\nSA\n\nWhile the time frame is quite limited, we can already see RSSY outperforming not only its peers, but also broader dividend equity ETFs like SCHD and value plays like SPGP.\n\nSA\n\nThe new fund seems to be racing past its peer group, and I'm assuming that's because the fund managers have refined their strategy based on learnings from the sponsor's older products, like RSST, which uses a similar U.S. stocks and futures approach but with some significant differences. My best guess is that yield-harvesting on futures contract rolls is more lucrative than the trend-following strategy employed for RSST.\n\nOne important consideration here is that the fund is flexible in terms of direction. It uses both long and short trades to maximize its yield, and that dynamic approach gives the fund managers a lot of freedom when compared to funds with more restrictive strategies, such as the leveraged and inverse ETFs that I've written quite a bit about in the past several months. I invite you to check those out if you're interested in how these various ETF strategies differ from each other.\n\nAs a knock-on effect, the daily rebalancing in the case of ETFs like RSSY is very different from that of leveraged and inverse ETFs that seek to achieve a gain equal to a multiple of the underlying assets. The difference is that the impact of volatility decay is a little muted in this scenario. That doesn't mean the risks are fewer or, well, less risky; all it means is that you won't see the kind of volatility drag on your investment that you see with leveraged and inverse leveraged ETFs, especially the 2x, -2x, 3x, and -3x funds.\n\nThat's a big consideration depending on how long you plan to hold the fund in question, but that's not a risk you need to be overly worried about with RSSY, in my opinion. However, please don't be under the impression that there's no leverage risk here, because futures contracts are, by definition, giving you added investment exposure. Leverage, in other words. The only reason I say that this particular risk is a little muted or less pronounced is that RSSY also invests directly in equities, while most leveraged ETFs don't. Direct equity ownership doesn't come with leverage risk because you're not getting any additional exposure for greater gains (or greater losses).\n\nThat said, there are certainly other risks you need to be aware of as an investor, including derivatives risk, VIE structure risk or Cayman subsidiary risk, commodity risk, bond risk, currency risk, leverage risk (as mentioned above), non-diversification risk, and the all-important new fund risk because this was recently launched.\n\nAll things considered, and with the limited historical data we have, I would definitely recommend this fund as a way to hedge your portfolio against - at the very least - the uncertain economic climate in the United States. Remember that this fund also gives you exposure to currencies as well as interest rates, and the long-short strategy used by the fund should, if they work as planned, help you offset at least some unrealized losses in your core portfolio of U.S. stocks. There's also the emerging market risk with RSSY, but the current situation with the strong dollar and higher-for-longer Fed fund rates transforms that risk into an opportunity if you're willing to hold RSSY for the long run.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to say before I recommend a Buy for RSSY is that you need to carefully weave this into your portfolio and size it based on your expectations for the overall market. While we don't yet know how this fund will perform in the event of a market downturn, it's structured in such a way that it should theoretically benefit from strong momentum regardless of the direction of that momentum. The 50% U.S. large-cap and 50% futures yield mix looks like it's structured to withstand a downturn, but it's not been tested in the real world yet. That, to me, is the biggest risk to be aware of.\n\nRegardless, from what I've seen of RSSY, it looks like a good way to hedge your other bets - the quantum of which you'll need to decide based on where you think the market will be headed in the next three, six, and twelve months. That's the real bottom-line consideration here, and I hope this analysis has been helpful. Please feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments section. Thank you for reading.",

        "title": "These 3 Dividend ETFs Are a Retiree's Best Friend",
        "body": "No two investors are ever exactly alike. However, there are some sweeping generalizations that are reasonably safe to make about investors as a whole. One of the obvious ones is that people with plenty of working years ahead of them should largely invest for growth, while retired investors should focus on generating reliable income from their savings.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) people in or near retirement should consider owning. While any single one of them would fit in most retirement portfolios, all three of them together would make a very well-rounded income-producing engine.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\n\nIt's easy to become so enamored by high dividend yields that you forget about dividend growth and capital appreciation. However, it's just as easy to fall into the opposite trap. That is, your hunt for reliable dividend growth can easily distract you from recognizing that a yield is oddly low compared to alternatives or that there's little hope for meaningful capital appreciation.\n\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG) offers a palatable balance of all of these dynamics.\n\nJust as the name suggests, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation fund's primary goal is delivering sustained dividend-payment growth over time. And it's done exactly that. Last year's total per-share payout of $3.21 is more than twice its 2013 payout of $1.39. Credit Standard & Poor's requirements for inclusion in the underlying S&P U.S. Dividend Growers index. S&P only considers companies (of all market caps) that have raised their annual dividend payments for at least 10 years in a row and then throws out the highest-yielding 25% of these names on the assumption that these high yields hint at potential challenges to their continued dividend payment growth.\n\nVeteran investors will likely know that inclusion in the list of so-called Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae* is slightly tougher. These names must have produced no less than 25 consecutive years of annual dividend growth and are also limited to S&P 500 stocks. Given this pickier requirement, why wouldn't a retiree opt for the similar ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEMKT: NOBL) instead -- especially given its higher yield of 2.3% versus the Vanguard ETF's current yield of only 1.8%?\n\nThere's certainly nothing wrong with the alternative. But there's one overarching reason VIG might make more sense for certain retirees. That is, with holdings like Microsoft, Visa, and Broadcom in its pool, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF offers more total upside without any less net dividend growth potential. It's just a little more volatile in the interim.\n\nStory continues\n\n* Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC.\n\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF\n\nThat being said, retirees certainly don't want to put themselves in the position of not collecting enough income to pay all of their bills right now. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) is a smart companion to a position in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation fund, while its trailing dividend yield stands at 3.4%.\n\nThis Schwab ETF is meant to mirror the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index -- a basket of the United States' 100 highest-yielding stocks, not including REITs (real estate investment trusts). Like the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers index that the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is based upon, inclusion in the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index requires at least 10 years' worth of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Unlike the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, however, all such tickers are eligible to become part of this index regardless of their yield. There's a specific preference for higher dividend yields, in fact.\n\nWhile the descriptions of the two ETFs are seemingly similar, there's actually quite a bit of contrast here. The Schwab fund's top holdings right now include names like Home Depot, Amgen, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.\n\nYou won't likely see quite as much dividend growth from the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF as you would with the aforementioned Vanguard Dividend Appreciation, and you probably won't experience as much price appreciation either. You are starting out with an above-average yield, though, and you're likely to see less volatility. That counts for at least a little something.\n\nVanEck BDC Income ETF\n\nLast but not least, income-minded retirees may want to consider adding the VanEck BDC Income ETF (NYSEMKT: BIZD) to their retirement portfolios.\n\nIt's distinctly different than the Schwab fund or the Vanguard fund, both of which solely hold stocks. The VanEck BDC Income ETF only owns shares in business development companies (or BDCs), offering investors simple exposure to an income-oriented sliver of the market that remains largely obscured.\n\nBusiness development companies are precisely what they sound like they are: They develop businesses. More specifically, they provide funding for up-and-coming companies that may not want to tap public markets but may also not qualify for a conventional bank loan. This cash can be offered in exchange for equity in the borrower's organization. More often than not, though, it's made available in the form of a high-interest-rate loan, reflecting the above-average risk these loans pose to the lender. That's why the VanEck fund's trailing yield is a frothy 10.1% -- that's the sort of yield this ETF's holdings are currently sporting.\n\nThere are trade-offs in owning this high-yield investment. One of them is the limited likelihood of meaningful capital appreciation. While there's some, this fund's business development company loans should be viewed as bonds, which are just interest-bearing instruments that return your initial capital once the original terms of the loan are repaid. Another trade-off is the surprising amount of volatility this ETF can dish out, given the underlying nature of the business.\n\nThe VanEck BDC Income ETF's one key attribute makes it all worthwhile for most retirees, though. That's a big (and surprisingly reliable) dividend supporting a yield that's consistently higher than the prevailing interest rates at any given time. If nothing else, you're sure to stay ahead of inflation with this fund.\n\nJust bear in mind that you'll want to own at least a couple of other less volatile dividend ETFs before stepping into this one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Specialized Funds - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Specialized Funds - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard Specialized Funds - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income Fund [NYSE: WIA]\n\nNotification of Sources of Distributions\n\nPursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940\n\nThe Fund's estimated sources of the distribution to be paid on June 28, 2024, and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows:\n\nEstimated Allocations for the June Monthly Distribution as of May 31, 2024:\n\nDistribution Per Share Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Return of Capital $0.0500 $0.0500 $0.0000 $0.0000 $0.0000 100.00% 100.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%\n\nCumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of May 31, 2024, for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2024:\n\nDistribution Per Share Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Return of Capital $0.3000 $0.3000 $0.0000 $0.0000 $0.0000 100.00% 100.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%\n\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of the Plan. WIA estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the WIA distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect WIA's investment performance and should not be confused with \u02dcyield' or \u02dcincome'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported herein are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nAverage Annual Total Return (in relation to the change in net asset value (NAV) for the 5-year period ended on 5/31/2024)1 Annualized Distribution Rate (as a percentage of NAV as of 5/31/2024)2 Cumulative Total Return (in relation to the change in NAV for the fiscal period through 5/31/2024)3 Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate (as a percentage of NAV as of 5/31/2024)4 1.49% 6.48% 3.72% 3.24%\n\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information:\n\nAverage Annual Total Return in relation to NAV represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ended through May 31, 2024. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. The Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period's distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2024. Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV from November 30, 2023 through May 31, 2024, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the fiscal period November 30, 2023 through May 31, 2024, as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2024.\n\nThis Fund has a managed distribution policy that seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. Distributions may be paid in part or in full from net investment income, realized capital gains and by returning capital, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if a Fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the Fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. A return of capital is not taxable; rather it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The Board of Directors of the Fund may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.\n\nFor further information on Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income Fund, please visit our web site at: www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/closed-end-funds\n\nData and commentary provided in this press release are for informational purposes only.

The is on track for gains on 15% year to date, the is 19% higher, while the only gained 4%.\n\nPCE data suggests cooling inflation\n\nInflation in the U.S. decelerated as expected in May compared to the prior month, according the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of price gains, potentially providing more impetus for the Fed to roll out interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe headline personal consumption expenditures price index was flat on a basis, retreating from a rise of 0.3% in April. In the 12 months to May, the also cooled to 2.6% from 2.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, so-called \"core\" PCE, which strips out volatile items like food and fuel, eased to 0.1% and 2.6% .\n\nThis is a closely watched measure of inflation, widely regarded as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, and this moderation in price pressures is likely to strengthen the case for interest rate cuts this year.\n\nThe Fed is guiding for just one interest rate cut this year in December, but market participants still widely expect two cuts starting in September, hoping for a sustained downtrend in price pressures.\n\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly on Friday said she believes inflation is gradually cooling, saying the latest data showing inflation did not rise at all from April to May is \"good news that policy is working.\"\n\n\"We are getting evidence that (policy) is tight enough,\" Daly told CNBC in an interview. \"It's really challenging to look anywhere and not see monetary policy working. We have growth slowing, spending slowing, the labor market slowing, inflation coming down.\"\n\nStill, Daly said, there is more work for policy to do, and she expects inflation to be above the Fed's 2% goal potentially through the end of 2025.\n\nPresidential debate outcome\n\nInvestors are also digesting the first Presidential debate of the 2024 elections, between Democrat and Republican candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nBiden appeared to struggle through much of Thursday's highly-anticipated 90-minute debate with Republican challenger Donald Trump, stumbling through questions put to him by the event's moderators.\n\nBiden's performance was marked by a hoarse voice and a series of long pauses, which largely overshadowed his attacks on Trump's recent criminal conviction and his failure to accept democratic norms. Trump, meanwhile, took aim at Biden's record on the economy and foreign policy.\n\nNike slumps after flagging sales decline\n\nShares in Nike (NYSE: ) shed more than 17% after the sports apparel company told investors that revenue is expected to fall by 10% in the current quarter.\n\nSales in the ongoing fiscal year are also seen decreasing by a percentage in the mid-single digits.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: ) rose 6% after CNN\u2019s flash poll showed that the Republican candidate has outperformed US President Joe Biden in the first presidential debate.\n\nInfinera (NASDAQ: ) stock soared almost 20% after Nokia (HE: ) announced plans to buy U.S. optical networking gear maker in a $2.3 billion deal, amid plans to gain from the billions of dollars in investment pouring into data centres to cater to the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nCrude on track for weekly gain\n\nCrude prices rose Friday, on course for the third consecutive winning week as fears of supply disruptions in Russia and the Middle East largely offset concerns over slowing demand.\n\nBy 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% higher at $81.94 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.2% to $85.43 per barrel.\n\nand WTI futures have gained nearly 2% so far this week, with both benchmarks also on track for gains of around 6% in June.\n\nFears of a wider war between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah kept markets on edge over disruptions in crude supplies, while attacks by Ukraine on major Russian fuel refineries also pointed to potential disruptions in oil supplies from Moscow.\n\nThe geopolitical conflicts saw traders attach a higher risk premium to oil prices.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)",

        "title": "Davide-Campari Milano: Toasting While Waiting For Better Prices (OTCMKTS:DVDCF)",
        "body": "5PH/iStock via Getty Images\n\nCampari is one of those companies that, if you are Italian like me, you have to know because it dominates in one of the things we love the most: aperitifs and drinks. It is a company that I have closely followed for several months since I perceived a strong brand power but, for different reasons, I never decided to invest my money. After a 25 %-ish stock price decrease on the Italian Stock Exchange, it is time to study the company and decide if now is the right time to pull the trigger on this amazing company.\n\nI will begin this article with a company overview. I will continue by discussing its financials, its prospects and the risks of investing in such a corporation. I will finally conclude with a valuation.\n\nCompany's quotation on Italian stock exchange (Google)\n\nCompany Overview\n\nIntroduction\n\nDavide-Campari Milano is the parent company that owns several globally recognized brands, such as:\n\nAperol: It is the quintessential aperitif and one of the main ingredients of the Italian Spritz. It is characterized by its typical orange color and its bittersweet savor.\n\nCampari: It is the famous red bitter, used for the famous Negroni cocktail.\n\nSkyy Vodka: It is one of the most-known vodkas in the world, especially in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, and Italy. It was acquired by the Davide-Campari group in 2006.\n\nThe group now manages a portfolio of more than 50 brands. Most of these have global priority, while others have regional priority and contribute to the culture of specific geographical areas, for example, Amaro Averna from Sicily.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe company's growth is driven by organic sales increase and brand acquisitions.\n\nFor what concerns the former, the company is primarily focused on growing its global priority brands, which represent the majority of its revenues, while developing a steady growth for the local and regional priorities through periodical renewals. The company also is applying a cost reduction policy to have as much money as possible to reinvest in its businesses.\n\nDavide-Campari is constantly searching in the market for new companies to acquire. M&A allows the company to develop its presence in high-potential markets. In particular, Campari's strategy is to look for new companies in markets where it controls its distribution.\n\nThe company leverages the widespread recognition of its products to command premium prices because its customers know and trust them. Moreover, it uses the brand's reputation to attract new customers through brand campaigns and by establishing strategic partnerships. One of the highlights is their \"We Are Cinema\" campaign, launched during the 77th Festival de Cannes. This campaign celebrates the connection between Campari and the world of cinema, featuring events and partnerships.\n\nSpirits Market\n\nEven though the company is well diversified, producing several kinds of alcoholic beverages, Davide-Campari's core business is spirits. In the next five years, the spirit's market is expected to grow at around 5.91% CAGR with the fastest-growing market represented by Asia Pacific.\n\nWhat I do not like about the sector is its tight relation with general economic conditions. In my view, in a period of poor economy, alcohol is one of the first cuts for households. It is not random that a lot of countries such as Finland, the U.S., Italy, and many others saw a reduction in alcohol consumption during 2022 while the global economy saw huge inflation spikes.\n\nFinancial Data\n\nIncome Statement\n\nOver the last six years, revenues increased at a sound 8.6% CAGR, driven by both organic sales increase and acquisitions. The good revenue performance is, however, eased by a steady decrease in profitability margins. During the same period, net income increased only at a 1.2% CAGR, or in other words, the net margin passed from 13.1% in 2021 to 11.3% last year.\n\nIncome Statement Overview (Author's Excel Sheet)\n\nHowever, margin compression is in line with the sector, in fact, also the competitors witnessed similar results over the last couple of years.\n\nNet Margin Comparison (Author's Excel Sheet)\n\nIn Q1 2024 the company reported a slight decrease in revenues of less than 1% and an outstanding 8.6% in profit before tax, mainly driven by some operating adjustments, not directly disclosed by the company.\n\nOver the long run, I expect the company to continue growing its revenues by around 5-6% for the next five years, in line with the industry. Still, I do not expect major enhancements in net margin performance over that period, as the company is aggressively investing in brand building and commercial capabilities to fuel organic topline growth.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nDespite the numerous acquisitions overtaken in the last years, the company has a solid balance sheet and a good liquidity position. I expect the company to exploit its robustness and liquidity power to acquire other brands in the following months.\n\nLast acquisitions of the group (Company's website)\n\nOver the last few years, the debt-over-equity ratio slightly increased, mainly due to the M&A activity, however, it remains at a healthy level and allows the company to rely on leverage in the future.\n\nDebt/Equity ratio (Author's Excel sheet)\n\nThe worrying part of the balance sheet is represented by the inventory, which has seen a huge spike over the years. I expect the company to be able to slow down this trend in the future to decrease its net working capital and overall increase the free cash flow.\n\nInventory trend (Author's Excel sheet)\n\nCash Flow Statement\n\nThe spike in changes in net working capital represents the main reason for a decrease in free cash flow, which ended up being negative in the last two years.\n\nFree Cash Flow Trend (Author's Excel sheet)\n\nConsidering that the company pays an annual dividend, I would like to see a major reversal of this trend. At the moment, with a negative free cash flow, the company is taking new debt to guarantee dividends to shareholders. I will wait on the sidelines for a return to positive free cash flow before I finally decide to invest my money in this stock.\n\nFuture Prospects And Catalysts\n\nI find three main positive prospects when it comes to Campari:\n\nFuture gross margin expansion: As the company grows and expands its economy of scale, I perceive the possibility for gross margin expansion. Larger production volumes can reduce per-unit costs, while bulk purchasing can lower raw material expenses. These efficiencies contribute directly to improving profit margins. Moreover, continued expansion into emerging markets provides growth and margin improvement opportunities. Finally, Recent mergers and acquisitions can yield synergies that improve cost structures and operational efficiencies. Integration of acquired companies can lead to cost savings, revenue growth, and margin enhancement through shared best practices and economies of scale.\n\nAs the company grows and expands its economy of scale, I perceive the possibility for gross margin expansion.

Finally, Recent mergers and acquisitions can yield synergies that improve cost structures and operational efficiencies. Integration of acquired companies can lead to cost savings, revenue growth, and margin enhancement through shared best practices and economies of scale. New CEO: Matteo Fantacchiotti has the potential to be a catalyst for positive change, driving the company towards greater innovation, efficiency, and market success. His fresh perspective and strategic initiatives can unlock new opportunities, positioning the company for sustained growth and profitability. After several years in the management team of Aperol in Asia, Matteo now sees the opportunity to unlock new revenue streams by boosting Aperol sales in that region. Additionally, the CEO is excited about opening the company's new headquarters in the city center of Milan, which will enhance the company's global visibility. It is evident that the new CEO understands the company's needs to continue scaling at these levels.\n\nMatteo Fantacchiotti has the potential to be a catalyst for positive change, driving the company towards greater innovation, efficiency, and market success.

Additionally, the CEO is excited about opening the company's new headquarters in the city center of Milan, which will enhance the company's global visibility. It is evident that the new CEO understands the company's needs to continue scaling at these levels. New acquisitions: As already disclosed in a previous paragraph, the company got us used to a lot of M&A activities during the last few years. As stated in the last earnings call, the company expects to continue with acquisitions in the future months. New brands can easily enhance the company's value, increase its revenues, and increase its profitability margins through synergies.\n\nRisks\n\nA complete list of the risks of the company is available in the company's financial report, In this article, I will just discuss the main ones.\n\nFirst of all, competition. The main competitors are large international groups that apply aggressive strategies at a global level and that usually benefit from a strong financial position and a diversified portfolio of brands and geographical areas. These competitors could imply a reduction in the distribution outlets available to the group or involve higher distribution costs.\n\nCompetitors could also introduce new products, new trends, or new savors that may lead to a drop in the company's revenue in the short term.\n\nSimilarly to other industries, also alcohol delivery is witnessing a rise in sales. This new phenomenon is mainly driven by a spike in people buying alcoholic products on the day of an event. Around 57% of people buying alcohol online buy it last minute, while 24% of surveyed shoppers order it one or two days in advance. The reason for this new trend is simple: the convenience of having it delivered to their door is hard to pass up.\n\nThis new trend can be a huge problem for a company like Davide-Campari that sells traditional and classical spirits and wines because a variety of exotic brands and products have hit the online market: fruity alcoholic kombuchas, aromatic seltzers, boozy iced teas, CBD-spiked juices, craft brews, and more. Unlike old generations, many of today's consumers are looking for alcoholic drinks that are original or artisanal.\n\nIn such an environment, Davide-Campari is not so well-positioned to take advantage of this new trend.\n\nMoreover, news from a few days ago revealed that the company is under investigation for tax evasion amounting to over 1 billion euros during the period between 2018 and 2020, attributed to the Luxembourg-based holding Lagfin. The company has stated its complete confidence, assuring that it has always fulfilled its tax obligations. This is a hot topic that both new investors and current shareholders must monitor very carefully.\n\nValuation\n\nUnlike in other articles where I considered the discounted cash flow model as the primary method to assess a company, in this case, it does not make sense to use it because the company has a negative free cash flow. Instead, I decided to assess Campari using the dividend discount model. Despite the current negative free cash flow, the company has the potential to return to previous levels by focusing on better inventory management and optimizing its net working capital. The inventory spike was primarily due to price increases witnessed during 2022, which continued to impact 2023. I expect a return to positive results as early as 2024 to finance future dividends.\n\nDividend Discount Model (Author's Excel Sheet)\n\nOver the last five years, the dividend remained constant at 0.06\u20ac per share, with just an increase to 0.07\u20ac in 2024, which corresponds to a spike of 16.67%. The average of the growth of dividends spread over the 5 years is around 4.5%. Imposing a 10% market return (r), even expecting a very high annual dividend growth rate of 9%, the company would result as overvalued.\n\nConclusions\n\nCampari is one of the most renowned companies in the alcoholic beverages industry. It has promising prospects, driven mainly by a new promising CEO, potential profitability margin expansion, and future possible acquisitions. However, it operates in a highly competitive industry and is not well-positioned to capitalize on the new online shopping trend that the market is experiencing. Additionally, the company has negative free cash flow, declining Q1 2024 revenues compared to previous years, and, according to recent news, faces potential prosecution for tax evasion. For all these reasons, I assign a \"hold\" rating to the company.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "TFS Financial: Carefully Navigating Uncertain Times (NASDAQ:TFSL)",
        "body": "sshepard\n\nTFS Financial Overview\n\nTFS Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:TFSL) is an interesting regional bank that conducts majority of its business in two states: Ohio and Florida. The bank also has an interesting two tiered ownership structure where majority owners own 80% of shares and don't receive any dividends, whereas minority owners own only 20% of its shares (mainly retail investors) that receive a nice dividend. Since only 1/5th of existing shares receive dividend, the company's high payout ratio is actually misleading and its dividend is well covered.\n\nI've covered this stock in the past in an article titled TFS Financial: Income Play With Unique Ownership Structure. Since then, the company announced its quarterly earnings in two separate reports, once being in February (for the quarter ending in December) and once in May (for the quarter ending in March). As much as the company's business goes, not much has changed and things seem to be going in a very stable manner for the bank.\n\nRevenues were up slightly QoQ, but also down slightly YoY. Interestingly enough, the company's debt holdings didn't change much, meaning that the company is not issuing more debt, but it's not getting rid of its existing debt holdings either. The company seems to be confident that its current holdings will generate sufficient income without putting the bank at too much risk, while at the same time it is very careful about adding more debt to its books during these uncertain times which turned out to be even more challenging for smaller banks with less resources and more exposure to local markets. Notice that the company's assets, net loans and deposits did not move much from quarter to quarter in recent quarters because it chooses a careful approach about navigating these uncertain times instead of trying to grow aggressively in a risky manner.\n\nQuarterly Results (TFSL)\n\nAfter being at historically low levels for much of the period between 2010 and 2022, mortgage rates started climbing rapidly in 2022 as the Fed started hiking short-term interest rates in response to rising inflation. The Fed has no control over long-term rates, which are typically determined by the invisible forces of the market driven by supply and demand dynamics. Rising interest rates had 3 effects on banks that issue and service loans such as TFSL. First, it increased interest income for the bank, especially for newly issued or newly refinanced loans. There were also a small number of loans with floating rates, which were adjusted upwards and helped the bank's bottom line.\n\nSecond, higher rates also reduced demand for new loans and new refinancing deals. This means that even though each customer brought more money, there were fewer new customers. Third, since most homeowners locked their rates at much lower rates between 2010-2020, no one wanted to sell their home and lose their adventurous rates unless they absolutely had to. This also reduced the supply of available homes in the market. When jointed together, these three forces canceled each other out, and the company's interest income moved very little from the previous year.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nTFS Financial Dividend\n\nTFSL stock currently supports a dividend yield of 9% and as I said above, the company's dividend payments are fully supported by its income due to its unique structure of paying dividends only to minority holders or 1/5th of existing shares. Although the company has no history of cutting or reducing dividends since it started paying dividends, it hasn't raised its dividends in a while either. There was a period of regular dividend hikes from 2015 to 2020, but we haven't seen any dividend hikes in 4 years. Some investors are fine with it since the current yield of 9% is pretty good to start with, but others may be disappointed, especially if they entered their position during the period between 2015-2020 thinking those annual dividend hikes would continue on forever.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nTFSL Stock Valuation\n\nThe bank's valuation is also a victim of its current ownership structure, and the banks could either look cheap or super expensive depending on how you cut it. If you go by traditional metrics and traditional way of calculating the company's metrics, it looks very expensive at a P/E of 42-46 depending on whether you are looking at GAAP, non-GAAP, trailing or forward metrics.\n\nOn the other hand, if you keep the company's ownership situation into account and keep in mind that it pays dividends on only 20% of its shares and the rest of the shares are just held by insiders and treat them separately, then all these metrics will be divided by 5 and the company's P/E appears to be around 8-9 depending on which metric you look at which makes it somewhat cheaper than sector median of around 10-11. When the company itself announces its metrics, it offers both versions so that people have the full story. Of course, some investors may not feel comfortable with this type of setting, and they should probably stay away from this stock.\n\nValuation (Seeking Alpha)\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the economy right now. Inflation dropped from a peak of almost 10% to 3.5%, but it's still significantly above the Fed's target rate of 2.0%. Meanwhile, we are getting mixed signals from the economy. For example, on one hand, the economy is still adding jobs every month but on the other hand, layoffs are accelerating, and unemployment rate climbed from 3.5% to 4.0% in recent months. There are also probably some factors that are hiding the true picture of the unemployment situation because a lot of people are working for gig economy types of jobs such as those provided by companies like Uber (UBER) and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn the housing market, no one seems to know what is coming next. We've had economists predicting a correction in house prices since 2020, but home prices only climbed higher or stayed stable in most markets. Any correction we saw so far has been very limited in scope despite rising rates, rising unemployment and tighter credit conditions, which leaves many economists puzzled. Regional banks like TFSL have to navigate this environment very carefully. They can't afford to make too many mistakes, as we've already seen with so many failed banks in recent years. The bank will have to manage its balance sheet, assets and debt situation very carefully and ensure that it's well protected against any risk events such as what housing markets experienced in 2008.\n\nAll in all, this is a good company with a nice dividend for it is suitable for portfolios of income oriented investors, but since we are living in uncertain times, I would keep my position size small. This bank could be a good part of a well-diversified portfolio, but I wouldn't put a big portion of my portfolio here.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- To see the stress mounting again on Wall Street\u2019s junior bankers, just look a half-rung higher, at staffers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNot staff, as in employees, but staffers, the unheralded deputy managers who dole out assignments to trainees. When investment bankers or clients want something done, staffers find underlings for the drudgery. That\u2019s getting trickier as banks exit a slump in deals with thinner headcount and big ambitions for landing new mandates.\n\nTrainees and staffers alike are now feeling the strain.\n\nA junior banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and another at UBS Group AG, for example, privately said they\u2019re inflating their weekly hours in internal tracking systems so bosses don\u2019t make them give up their last bits of free time. At Bank of America Corp., two trainees said they\u2019re instead understating to avoid breaching 100-hour limits, dubbed \u201ctripping the system,\u201d which can prompt a call from HR and stir up trouble for managers.\n\nWhen banks do run short of junior bankers to crank out analyses and pitch decks, it falls on staffers to tell the bosses tough luck. A Citigroup Inc. staffer recently recalled how nerve-wracking that was her first time.\n\nAfter emailing a managing director that everyone was too busy, she cried and got physically ill. When the response later arrived \u2014 \u201cI am so disappointed in you\u201d \u2014 she stared at her screen in angst. She later left.\n\nInterviews with current and recently departed junior bankers and their managers show that 100-hour work weeks, which never went away, are once again becoming more common as investment banks chase a modest but growing flow of deals. The employees asked not to be identified to protect their careers.\n\nThe swelling workloads are testing promises banks made just a few years ago to give trainees breaks and safeguard their health. And, for young bankers, it\u2019s bringing old frustrations back to the fore.\n\nThe death on May 2 of Bank of America associate Leo Lukenas from a heart attack \u2014 just days after the former Green Beret finished work on a $2 billion deal \u2014 triggered an outpouring of those feelings on online message boards. Though authorities attributed Lukenas\u2019 death to natural causes, anonymous posters vented about being asked to do too much and called for a walkout, which never materialized.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America has said its executives take junior bankers\u2019 health seriously and that the firm frequently reviews policies to ensure they\u2019re protected. As for how they log time, the firm said, \u201cour practice is clear and we expect employees to accurately record their hours.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nLong hours have always been a facet of Wall Street\u2019s training programs. But unlike the tsunami of activity junior bankers handled during the pandemic, the recent sense in the lower rungs is that much of the work is on spec, as bosses try to position their firms for an upswing, especially once interest rates fall.\n\nWith many desks just starting to see revenue increase, trainees have little leverage to demand better conditions. Peloton exercise bikes that some firms offered a few years ago are now gathering dust because, as a young banker at one boutique firm put it, nobody has time to use them anymore.\n\n\u201cThe culture in banking isn\u2019t keeping up with the times and needs of junior bankers,\u201d said Stephan Meier a professor at Columbia Business School. Instead, supervisors keep making the mistake of viewing trainees as resources to be used or wasted, he said.\n\n\u201cEither firms squeeze out as much as possible of their junior bankers, and that\u2019s good for the business, or if they don\u2019t, it hurts the performance of the organization,\u201d Meier said. \u201cThat\u2019s the wrong mindset.\u201d\n\nChest Pains\n\nFirms have bolstered safeguards and perks in recent years, such as ensuring some Saturdays off or providing free fitness classes. Yet workloads haven\u2019t been curtailed to allow for it, employees said in interviews. That leaves them to argue with staffers or, worse, anger the more powerful bosses they need to impress.\n\nOne junior banker who left Lazard Inc. late last year said she couldn\u2019t bring herself to seek help, even as her health deteriorated. She felt pressure in her chest while working, Googled \u201cheart attack symptoms\u201d and contacted a medical hotline, which urged her to see a doctor. But she stayed at her desk, worried that if it were a false alarm, bosses would view a trip to a clinic as a poor excuse for blowing deadlines. Feeling worse months later, she quit to start a new career.\n\nA junior banker at another big bank said he also kept working while experiencing chest pain after gulping an energy drink to finish a 100-hour week. He thought about seeing a doctor, but everyone else on his team was pulling the same hours, and he didn\u2019t want to stand out as the one who couldn\u2019t hack it.\n\nA May survey by the social media platform Overheard on Wall Street found junior bankers are putting in an average of about 80 hours a week \u2014 equating to more than 11 hours a day including weekends \u2014 and sleeping about five hours a night. Yet some of the roughly 200 participants claimed to have notched 140-hour weeks, leaving only four hours a day for sleeping and other necessities.\n\nAsked to score their mental and physical health on a scale of 1 to 10, the average responses were 2 and 3, respectively, according to a copy of the results seen by Bloomberg.\n\nA question about the pressure on young bankers even made its way into JPMorgan\u2019s annual investor day last month. Jennifer Piepszak, co-head of commercial and investment banking, responded that nothing is more important than the well-being of employees and that managers need to ensure that.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit in our offices and go through business reviews,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be out in the field and every one of us are, so that we have a sense of where the pressure might be mounting, and we need to give people the resources to be able to cope.\u201d\n\nStaffer Conflicts\n\nAt many banks, the role of staffer has existed for decades. They appear in Michael Lewis\u2019 Liar\u2019s Poker, portraying life at Salomon Brothers in the high-flying 1980s, and in John Rolfe and Peter Troob\u2019s Monkey Business, chronicling young bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette during the dot-com bubble.\n\nThough many staffers are mere vice presidents \u2014 near the bottom of the management tree \u2014 banks typically ask them to ensure higher-ups don\u2019t demand too much from new arrivals. Indeed, a staffer at a bulge-bracket bank said she requested the job so she could help protect junior bankers after her own training at boutique Houlihan Lokey was so rigorous that she began bringing a sleeping bag to the office.\n\nStill, several junior bankers interviewed by Bloomberg described their staffers as clearly conflicted \u2014 more eager to impress rainmakers and climb the ladder than to push back.\n\nA Citigroup employee said that he kept telling his staffer that his weekly hours were surpassing the 100 that the bank\u2019s software would let him log \u2014 only to be told that everyone was stretched and that the deals still needed to get done.\n\n\u2018Selling Your Soul\u2019\n\nStrolling around Manhattan, it\u2019s easy to find signs of Wall Street\u2019s intense treatment of trainees.\n\nA young man was seen doing push-ups on Park Avenue\u2019s sidewalk Thursday, sweating through his dress clothes with the sun overhead. Asked what was happening, he said he was being punished by his boss for screwing up a pitch deck.\n\nFor those who stick with it, the goal remains a high-paying career. At investment banks, such lucre may not be quite as abundant as when formal training programs were set up as a gateway into private partnerships. But the experience is still valuable, with many junior bankers soon defecting to private equity or money management.\n\n\u201cGoing into banking, you are making the conscious decision of giving up your lifestyle,\u201d said Hamilton Lin, co-founder of Wall Street Training & Advisory. \u201cYou are selling your soul to the devil, but it\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Todd Gillespie, Ryan Gould and Peter Eichenbaum.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

You may also click here for additional information: www.faruqilaw.com/ALT.\n\nNEW YORK, June 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Altimmune, Inc. (Altimmune or the Company) (NASDAQ: ALT) and reminds investors of the July 5, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Altimmune overstated the potential for pemvidutide to stand out from competing GLP-1 agonists based on the drug's efficacy and tolerability results observed in the MOMENTUM Trial; (2) accordingly, the MOMENTUM Trial results were less significant to pemvidutide's clinical, commercial, and competitive prospects than Defendants had led investors to believe; (3) as a result of all the foregoing, Defendants had overstated Altimmune's prospects for finding a strategic partner to develop pemvidutide; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Kerrisdale Capital published a report (the Kerrisdale Report) alleging that a deeper examination of Altimmune's data reveals a drug with little chance of competing against either the approved incumbents or the other GLP-1 agonists progressing through clinical trials. In particular, the Kerrisdale Report found that even if pemvidutide did result in 15.6% weight-loss, that's not good enough because competing, already approved GLP1 agonists semaglutide and tirzepatide (Ozempic and Mounjaro) have demonstrated superior weight-loss on a comparable basis, with the added benefit of controlling blood-sugar (which pemvidutide does not), while noting that pemvidutide's tolerability is atrocious compared to these same drugs. (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the Kerrisdale Report concluded that we don't think legitimate prospective partners want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and years of trials pursuing an obvious dead end.\n\nOn this news, Altimmune's stock price fell $1.94 per share, or 18.65%, to close at $8.46 per share on February 13, 2024.\n\nThen, on April 29, 2024, Bloomberg published an article entitled Altimmune Down as Guggenheim Sees Overhang in No Partnership, reporting that Guggenheim Securities downgraded Altimmune's stock to neutral from buy saying a partnership for the biotech's lead asset pemvidutide looks \u02dcincreasingly unlikely.' In particular, Guggenheim Securities stated that the opportunity to successfully fund pemvidutide's future as a treatment for obesity through a strategic partnership was growing increasingly tenuous and that the failure of a partner to emerge now five months from the end of Phase 2 presents an overhang that can no longer be ignored as a major partnership or M&A event would have materialized already if pemvidutide was viewed as a serious competitor in the growing obesity/ NASH landscapes by potential strategics or investors.\n\nOn this news, Altimmune's stock price fell $0.87 per share, or 11.98%, to close at $6.39 per share on April 29, 2024.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Altimmune's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Altimmune class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ALT or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook (NASDAQ: ).\n\nAttorney Advertising.

        "body": "On Friday, Stifel adjusted its stance on Nike Inc (NYSE: ), shifting its rating from Buy to Hold and significantly reducing the price target from $117.00 to $88.00.\n\nThe downgrade comes as a reaction to Nike's updated fiscal year 2025 guidance, marking the fifth downward consensus revision in six quarters. The new guidance suggests that growth inflection for the company may be delayed until the latter half of 2025, possibly not before the fourth fiscal quarter or spring of 2025.\n\nThe analyst from Stifel cited multiple reasons for the downgrade, including the requirement for investors to endorse unproven styles and to look past an uncertain consumer discretionary environment until the second half of 2024, with the hope that momentum could be regained heading into the second half of 2025.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst pointed to challenges in management credibility and the potential for changes at the C-level, which introduces additional uncertainty for the company's outlook.\n\nAn upcoming Investor Day in November is expected to present a multi-year economic model for Nike that may forecast lower returns than previous models, which could affect the premium historically associated with Nike's stock. This anticipated announcement is seen as introducing further risk to the company's valuation.\n\nDespite the downgrade, Stifel acknowledged Nike's significant scale advantage in a market with long-term growth potential and structural margin opportunities. However, the firm indicated that the current stock valuation does not present a compelling case for upside until the prospects for growth become more concrete. The report emphasizes the need for tangible growth before a more positive outlook on Nike's shares can be justified.\n\nIn other recent news, Nike Inc. has been downgraded to Equal-weight from Overweight by Morgan Stanley, with a revised price target of $79, down from $114. This adjustment follows Nike's reported results which did not meet expectations, leading to a reevaluation of the company's near-term growth prospects. Moreover, Nike's recent strategic changes have resulted in a series of quarterly misses and lowered guidance, suggesting a continuation of earnings volatility in the near term.\n\nNike's fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings report revealed a 1% annual revenue increase and a 15% growth in earnings per share. However, the company's Q4 revenue remained flat, with declines noted in the lifestyle product category and digital sales. Looking ahead, Nike anticipates a mid-single-digit decline in reported revenue for fiscal 2025, with the first half expected to be down in the high single digits.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nike is focusing on innovation and market repositioning, including managing the supply of classic footwear franchises to strengthen its market position. The company also plans to double the growth of innovations by the end of 2025.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nIn light of Stifel's recent downgrade of Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), investors may find value in examining key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. Nike has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder returns, having raised its dividend for 22 consecutive years and maintained dividend payments for 41 consecutive years. This consistency is a testament to its financial stability and could be a reassuring factor for investors amidst the current uncertainty.\n\nInvestingPro data highlights a market cap of $142.36 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.48, which, when compared to the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 at 27.18, suggests a relatively stable valuation over time. Additionally, Nike's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 stands at $51.58 billion, with a growth of 1.89%, indicating a modest increase in sales. Despite the recent price target reduction, the company continues to trade near its 52-week low, which may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors who believe in the brand's resilience and market position.\n\nWith 11 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, caution is warranted. However, for those looking to delve deeper into Nike's financial health and future prospects, InvestingPro offers additional insights. There are 6 more InvestingPro Tips available, which could provide further context and analysis for making informed investment decisions.

The analyst pointed out that these factors contribute positively to the Trust's asset value.\n\nIn addition to the current status of the properties, the analyst also recognized potential future opportunities for Federal Realty Investment Trust. It was mentioned that several of the assets have the potential for densification, which could allow for further development and growth of the Trust's holdings in these areas.\n\nThe adjusted price target reflects Stifel's assessment of Federal Realty Investment Trust's assets and prospects. The Hold rating indicates that the firm advises investors to maintain their current position in the stock without suggesting a buy or sell action at this time.\n\nIn other recent news, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) has been making significant strides in the retail real estate market.

        "body": "On Friday, Lake Street Capital Markets adjusted its outlook on UFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT), increasing the price target to $300 from the previous $270, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The firm's analyst highlighted the positive developments at UFP Technologies, including successful ongoing operations with Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ) and the reduction of excess inventory at certain customers, as key factors that position the company for improving results throughout the year.\n\nThe analyst expressed confidence in the potential for UFP Technologies to exceed the conservative consensus estimates and anticipates possible upward revisions. The forecast suggests that the company's earnings per share (EPS) could be underestimated and that there is a trajectory for UFP to potentially reach $9 in EPS by 2026 and exceed $10 in 2027.\n\nThe firm acknowledges that the stock's valuation has been a point of contention among some investors, a sentiment that has persisted since the stock was trading around $70. However, the expectation is that the shares will continue to progress as the company executes its strategy and moves towards double-digit EPS.\n\nThe analyst also noted the role of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a potential catalyst for the stock. The positive stance on UFP Technologies is based on the belief that the market may still be underestimating the company's earnings potential as its revenue scales up.\n\nIn summary, Lake Street Capital Markets has reiterated its Buy rating for UFP Technologies and raised its price target to $300, citing improving company performance, the potential for earnings growth, and the possibility of M&A activity as key drivers for the stock's future appreciation.\n\nIn other recent news, UFP Technologies has been the subject of significant attention from Lake Street Capital Markets. The firm notably increased UFP Technologies' stock price target to $231, up from the previous $188, while maintaining a Buy rating. This upgrade comes in light of the company's impressive quarterly performance, with Lake Street highlighting the ongoing momentum at Intuitive Surgical and the significant earnings potential as revenues continue to grow.\n\nDespite facing excess inventory challenges, the analyst expressed confidence that these issues would not impede UFP Technologies' growth trajectory in 2024. The company remains on track to meet its financial targets, including a revenue growth rate of 12%-18%, a gross margin range of 28%-31%, and an operating margin between 15%-18%.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nRecent analysis from InvestingPro underscores the financial health and market position of UFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT). The company is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 40.4 and a P/E ratio of 40.55 for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, which suggests that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that two analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating a positive outlook on the company's performance.\n\nMoreover, UFP Technologies' cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, and the company operates with a moderate level of debt, which may provide investors with confidence in its financial stability. Additionally, the firm's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, further underscoring its solid financial footing. It's also worth noting that the company has been profitable over the last twelve months, with a revenue growth of 7.11% during the same period, and analysts predict the company will maintain profitability this year.\n\nFor investors looking to delve deeper into UFP Technologies' financials and market potential, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available at https://www.investing.com/pro/UFPT.

        "body": "On Friday, BMO Capital maintained its Market Perform rating on shares of Aon Corp (NYSE:AON) with a steady price target of $325.00. The firm's commentary followed the recent announcement regarding Aon's CFO Christa Davies' transition to a senior advisor role.\n\nAon Plc had previously announced on April 3, 2024, that its CFO, Christa Davies, would be retiring. In a new development, Aon filed a document on Thursday indicating that Davies would continue as a senior advisor to the company until May 2026. This extended advisory role is anticipated to result in Davies receiving approximately $38 million, which includes around $3 million in Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). These figures were not fully anticipated in earlier estimates.\n\nThe compensation package Davies is set to receive contrasts with the special Performance Share Units (PSUs) granted in July 2023. By transitioning to a senior advisory position, she will forfeit these special PSUs, which had the potential to be worth up to $55 million.\n\nThe financial implications of Davies' altered compensation and role were highlighted by BMO Capital as a significant factor. The firm's analysis suggests that the forfeiture of the special PSUs, in favor of the estimated compensation, will result in a lesser overall cost to Aon than previously assumed.\n\nBMO Capital's reiteration of the Market Perform rating and the $325.00 price target reflects their current view of Aon's stock in light of these recent corporate developments. The target price remains unchanged following the update on the company's financial leadership and compensation arrangements.\n\nIn other recent news, Aon plc (NYSE: ) has experienced significant developments in its executive leadership and business operations.

Edmund Reese has been appointed as the new executive vice president and CFO, effective July 29, 2024.\n\nIn addition, Aon's annual shareholder meeting resulted in the election of 12 director nominees and approval of all seven proposals, including the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Aon has also launched a $350 million war insurance program in collaboration with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to support Ukraine's health care and agricultural sectors.\n\nDespite BofA Securities downgrading Aon's stock from Neutral to Underperform due to potential risks from its $13.4 billion acquisition of NFP and recent management shifts, the company reported strong first-quarter results for 2024, showcasing 5% organic revenue growth and 9% earnings per share growth.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "body": "On Friday, BMO Capital Markets sustained its Market Perform rating on shares of AvidXchange Holdings (NASDAQ:AVDX), with a steady price target of $13.00. Following a series of investor meetings in Boston, Toronto, and Montreal, the firm expressed a slightly increased belief in the company's competitive edge and potential for new customer acquisition. AvidXchange, represented by CEO Michael Praeger, CFO Joel Wilhite, and Head of IR Subhaash Kumar, discussed its market position and strategies for growth.\n\nInvestors' inquiries during the meetings were centered on four main areas: AvidXchange's competitive standing and the sustainability of its market advantage, the recent challenges that have impacted growth such as the slowdown in discretionary business-to-business (B2B) spending, avenues for revenue expansion including benefits from new product offerings, and the prospects for improved unit economics and margin growth.\n\nAvidXchange, specializing in automated invoice and payment processes for mid-market businesses, has been identified as having a significant opportunity for growth as the market remains largely untapped. The discussions highlighted that the company's unique position and offerings continue to present a substantial greenfield opportunity for attracting new customers.\n\nThe financial technology company's recent headwinds were also addressed, providing investors with a clearer understanding of the factors affecting its growth trajectory. Despite these challenges, the potential for top-line growth through new products was noted as a key driver that could support the company's forward momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the conversations touched upon AvidXchange's financial health, with a focus on the possibilities for achieving better unit economics and expanding margins. These factors are crucial as the company aims to strengthen its financial position and deliver value to shareholders.\n\nBMO Capital Markets' reaffirmation of the $13.00 price target reflects the firm's evaluation of AvidXchange's current strategies and market opportunities. The Market Perform rating indicates a neutral outlook on the stock's potential performance relative to the broader market.\n\nIn other recent news, AvidXchange Holdings Incorporated announced a robust Q1 2024 earnings report. The company reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue, surpassing $105 million, and achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 72.4%, exceeding its 2025 target. The adjusted EBITDA margin was over 16%. Despite a GAAP net loss of $1 million, the company's non-GAAP net income showed a positive trend. AvidXchange also highlighted its recent integrations with AppFolio (NASDAQ: ) and M3 as potential drivers for future growth.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "title": "Shopify: Valuation Does Not Match Fundamentals (NYSE:SHOP)",
        "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nMy previous cautious thesis about Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) aged well, as the stock is significantly underperforming compared to the broader market since November 2023. More than six months passed since my previous coverage and today I want to share my updated analysis of Shopify.\n\nShopify remains fundamentally robust with strong revenue growth momentum, operating leverage, and a fortress balance sheet. The management works hard on improving the ecosystem, which is another long-term bullish sign. However, my discounted cash flow analysis suggests that the stock is massively overvalued. Moreover, the recent history of Q2 consensus EPS downgrades suggests that the Wall Street sentiment is quite pessimistic. All in all, I reiterate my \"Hold\" rating for SHOP.\n\nRecent developments\n\nThe latest quarterly earnings were released on May 8, when the company surpassed consensus estimates. Revenue grew by 23.4% YoY. The adjusted EPS expanded significantly, from $0.01 to $0.20.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe EPS expansion was of high quality as the operating margin expanded from -10% to 7.4% YoY. On the other hand, a major part of expansion was achieved after cutting the R&D to revenue ratio from 30% to sub-18%. The free cash flow [FCF] less stock-based compensation [SBC] was quite modest at around $66. Nevertheless, it contributed to the company's balance sheet which is a fortress with $5 billion cash pile and much lower total debt levels.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe upcoming earnings release is scheduled for July 26. The adjusted EPS is expected to remain flat sequentially despite a projected 8% QoQ revenue growth. On a YoY basis, revenue is expected to grow around 19%, and the adjusted EPS to expand from $0.14 to $0.20. Wall Street sentiment around the upcoming earnings release is quite pessimistic with 23 EPS downgrades over the last 90 days, which is a bearish sign.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe management continues working hard on improving Shopify's ecosystem. We see it from aggressive R&D spending, which is still high in absolute terms despite a YoY contraction in the R&D to revenue ratio. Apart from in-house developments, Shopify also expands its partnerships network. The recent partnership expansion with Avalara will help merchants to streamline their processes related to tax compliance.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAmid the current AI revolution Shopify also does not forget about these cutting-edge technologies. The company recently expanded access to its AI-powered tools, which will also highly likely add the appeal of its ecosystem. Features include the Sidekick assistant and image-generation tools, which will also help merchants in streamlining their operations.\n\nOn the other hand, the macro environment remains quite uncertain. The Fed is still not cutting rates and now the market expects only one cut in 2024, instead of three cuts which were expected just a few months ago. Moreover, I think that there is a real probability of the Fed not cutting rates at all in 2024. I think so because there are really no reasons to rush as the U.S. economy is still robust, the unemployment rate is still close historical lows, and the fight against inflation looks over. The Fed highly likely realizes that easing monetary policy can lead to a spike in energy prices, which can launch a new wave of inflation growth. Therefore, from the macro environment perspective, the stock's near-term prospects look quite cloudy.\n\nValuation update\n\nThe stock was almost flat over the last twelve months with a modest 2.6% price increase. YTD performance looks poor with a 17% share price decrease. Despite the share price plunge, SHOP's valuation ratios are still extremely high. Most of ratios are lower than historical averages, but still around 10 P/S ratio looks too generous, in my opinion.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nHowever, SHOP's valuation ratios might be misleading because the company is aggressively growing. Therefore, I must simulate the discounted cash flow [DCF] model, and I want to start with figuring out the company's cost of equity. I ignore cost of debt for the discount rate because SHOP's debt levels are insignificant compared to its market cap. The discount rate is calculated using the CAPM approach and all variables are easily available on the Internet. According to calculations, SHOP's cost of equity is 17.25%.\n\nAuthor's calculations\n\nConsensus estimates project an 18% revenue CAGR, which I incorporate into my DCF model. The TTM FCF ex-SBC margin is 2.5%, which is my base year's assumption. I project a 150 basis points yearly expansion for the FCF margin because of the expected solid revenue growth.\n\nAuthor's calculations\n\nMy DCF simulation suggests that the business's fair value is around $47 billion, substantially lower than the current market capitalization. That said, the stock is significantly overvalued. I agree that a 17.25% discount rate might be too aggressive for SHOP. However, even with a soft 10% discount rate Shopify's valuation does not look justified.\n\nAuthor's calculations\n\nTo conclude, Shopify's valuation looks far from being called attractive. Even with a very soft discount rate and aggressive 18% revenue CAGR, the stock is still overvalued.\n\nRisks to my cautious thesis\n\nShopify's fundamentals are strong as the company demonstrates solid revenue growth and operating leverage. It has ample liquidity to continue investing loads of money in innovation and marketing, which can help in increasing revenue and EPS faster than consensus estimates project. That said, should SHOP deliver a strong earnings surprise in July, there might be a massive rally.\n\nMoreover, Shopify's performance is historically strong in July. The below bar chart from TrendSpider suggests that over the last nine years, July was positive in almost 90% of cases.\n\nTrendSpider\n\nAs we saw in the valuation update, SHOP's beta is extremely high. This means that the stock is volatile, and this includes swings in both directions. The stock has a history of showing sudden spikes in its price, which also might make my thesis look not good.\n\nBottom line\n\nTo conclude, I reiterate my \"Hold\" rating for SHOP. I think that the valuation is not justified despite all the fundamental strengths of the company. I am not ready to pay such a premium for the company which competes directly with a monster like Amazon (AMZN). Moreover, Wall Street analysts' sentiment around July's earnings release is quite pessimistic.",

        "body": "More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues\n\n18 hours ago Share\n\nGetty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights\n\nAer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the \u201cindefinite nature\u201d of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots\u2019 industrial action it \u201cmust cancel\u201d additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I\u2019m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they\u2019ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. \u201cTrying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: \u2018Because you\u2019re a group we can\u2019t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don\u2019t open until 9am\u2019.\u201d Mr McWatters told the BBC\u2019s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been \u201cleft high and dry\u201d, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. \u201cAt that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,\u201d he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had \u201cfallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children\u201d. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don\u2019t meet you, we do every day. \"We\u2019ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we\u2019re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don\u2019t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union F\u00f3rsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RT\u00c9 has reported. If sanctioned, F\u00f3rsa will have to give seven days\u2019 notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is \"willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis\". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and F\u00f3rsa to \"agree to this step\".\n\nHow many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?\n\nAll Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about \u20ac36,000 (\u00a330,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about \u20ac287,000 (\u00a3242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nWhat do I do if my Aer Lingus flight is cancelled?",

        "body": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Eaton (NYSE: ) Vance closed-end funds listed below released today the estimated sources of their June distributions (each a Fund). This press release is issued as required by the Funds' managed distribution plan (Plan) and an exemptive order received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Trustees has approved the implementation of the Plan to make monthly, as noted below, cash distributions to common shareholders, stated in terms of a fixed amount per common share. This information is sent to you for informational purposes only and is an estimate of the sources of the June distribution. It is not determinative of the tax character of a Fund's distributions for the 2024 calendar year. Shareholders should note that each Fund's total regular distribution amount is subject to change as a result of market conditions or other factors.\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: You should not draw any conclusions about each Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of each Fund's Plan. Each Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in each Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect each Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and/or tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following tables set forth estimates of the sources of each Fund's June distribution and its cumulative distributions paid for its fiscal year through June 30, 2024, and information relating to each Fund's performance based on its net asset

        "body": "By Andrew Chung\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Friday anti-camping laws used by authorities in an Oregon city to stop homeless people from sleeping in public parks and public streets - a ruling that gives local and state governments a freer hand in confronting a national homelessness crisis.\n\nThe justices ruled 6-3 to overturn a lower court's decision that found that enforcing the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass when no shelter space is available for the homeless violates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition on \"cruel and unusual\" punishments. Various jurisdictions employ similar laws.\n\nThe court's conservative justices were in the majority, while its three liberal members dissented.\n\nHomelessness remains a complex problem for public officials in the United States as many municipalities experience chronic shortages of affordable housing. On any given night, more than 600,000 people are homeless, according to U.S. government estimates.\n\nThe case focused on three ordinances in Grants Pass, a city of roughly 38,000 people in southwestern Oregon, that together prohibit sleeping in public streets, alleyways and parks while using a blanket or bedding. Violators are fined $295. Repeat offenders can be criminally prosecuted for trespass, punishable by up to 30 days in jail.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless, various liberal legal groups and other critics have said laws like these criminalize people simply for being homeless and for actions they cannot avoid, such as sleeping in public. They point to a 1962 Supreme Court ruling that the Eighth Amendment barred punishing individuals based on their status rather than their conduct.\n\nA point of contention during the Supreme Court's arguments in the case in April was whether homelessness can be deemed a status that would prohibit enforcing local laws.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration agreed with the plaintiffs that Grants Pass cannot enforce an \"absolute ban\" on sleeping in the city - which effectively criminalizes homelessness - but suggested the rulings by the lower courts against the city were too broad and should be reconsidered.\n\nProponents including various government officials have called such laws a necessary tool for maintaining public safety.\n\nThe case, which began in 2018, involved three homeless people who filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to block the measures impacting them in Grants Pass. One of the plaintiffs has since died.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Clarke ruled that the city's \"policy and practice of punishing homelessness\" violates the Eighth Amendment and barred it from enforcing the anti-camping ordinances. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Clarke's injunction against the ordinances.\n\nThe city had defended itself in the case in part by noting that homeless people have alternatives outside the city, including nearby undeveloped federal land, county campsites or state rest stops. The judge said that argument \"sheds light on the city's attitude towards its homeless citizens\" by seeking to drive them out or punish them if they stay.",

(Teladoc or the Company) (NYSE: TDOC) and reminds investors of the July 16, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Teladoc continued to expand its marketing spend throughout 2023, despite public assurances that it would pull back its advertising spending; (2) increased marketing spend on BetterHelp deteriorated Teladoc's revenue, with little return for that investment; (3) despite Teladoc's acknowledgment that increased advertising spend would be marginally inefficient due to market saturation, it continued to grow its advertising spend in the BetterHelp business; and (4) despite public statements that there remained a long runway for BetterHelp membership growth, BetterHelp's membership stagnated and then decreased in 2023, due to market saturation, largely due to BetterHelp's own marketing.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Teladoc announced its fourth quarter and full year results for the period ended December 31, 2023. The announcement disclosed that Teladoc had experienced substantially less growth than previously forecasted. The Company also disclosed that it was expecting decreased revenue for its BetterHelp segment, an online counseling service. Analysts attributed this trend to BetterHelp's market saturation and increased advertising costs causing a rise the cost of customer acquisitions.\n\nFollowing the release of the earnings report, Teladoc shares fell $4.85/share, or 23.6%, overnight.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Teladoc's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Teladoc class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/TDOC or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook (NASDAQ: ).\n\nAttorney Advertising.

        "body": "Hersham, United Kindom, June 28th, 2024, Chainwire\n\nElastos Partners with BEVM for Native Peer-to-Peer Loans. Partnership aims to unlock up to $1.3 trillion of dormant Layer 1 Value, as US consumers get excited about the 3rd Age of Bitcoin\n\nElastos, the SmartWeb ecosystem provider, has announced a partnership with the L2 provider, BEVM, to develop a peer-to-peer Bitcoin-denominated loan offering around the former\u2019s BeL2 protocol. Together the companies believe they can unlock up to $1.3 Trillion of dormant Layer 1 Bitcoin Value, which is supported by data from the latest Elastos\u2019 BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation & Trust) Index suggesting more than two-thirds of US tech-savvy consumers are comfortable using Bitcoin.\n\nCollateralizing 80% of assets while the Bitcoin Layer is untouched\n\nElastos believes momentum is building around the Third Age of Bitcoin, where users will be able to transact using Native Bitcoin. Partnering with BEVM to develop this Bitcoin Native loan product will allow users to collateralize up to 80% of their assets in return for L2 credit (stable coins, for instance) based on terms defined in a Bitcoin-assured smart contract. The integrity of the currency is assured by BeL2\u2019s unique ZK-proof process which means the Bitcoin Layer is untouched as the process can be completed without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin Layer. This maintains the integrity of the currency and avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result. This approach enables Elastos and BEVM to deliver a genuinely peer-to-peer loan product, which is completely disintermediated and anonymous. Verification (potentially through third party services) and resulting costs/delays would only be required in the event of a dispute between the two parties.\n\n\u201cThe BeL2 protocol perfectly reflects what BEVM is all about; developing and supporting EVM-compatible DApps which can run in the ecosystem to operate on Bitcoin L2. The loan offering is the perfect illustration of how such services could revolutionize the finance sector,\u201d Hakan Sezikli, Co-founder of the BEVM Foundation.\n\nLaunched in December \u201923, the Bitcoin Elastos Layer2 (BeL2) protocol is a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, enabling multiple functionalities such as staking and smart contracts to be denominated directly in the World\u2019s most popular digital currency. BEVM will be collaborating with the Elastos\u2019 BeL2 protocol to deliver a BTC Oracle to monitor and analyze all Bitcoin-based activity in real time. As the BeL2 protocol enables Bitcoin users to manage any relationship through the currency \u2013 from staking (\u2018interest\u2019), to complex multi-party agreements through smart contracts \u2013 the BTC Oracle will potentially become a vital source of insight into how the currency is being used.\n\nUS tech-savvy consumers trust Bitcoin\n\nThis partnership comes as new data from the Elastos\u2019 BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation & Trust) Index indicates growing excitement among US tech-savvy consumers for Bitcoin. 63% of \u2018tech savvy\u2019 consumers feel either \u2018perfectly comfortable\u2019 or, even, \u2018excited\u2019 about transacting in Bitcoin and over half respondents in the US are using Bitcoin at least once a month. Among the use cases:\n\n44% have already used Bitcoin to store savings\n\n42% have used the digital currency to purchase online\n\n34% to send/receive money from abroad\n\n23% turn to it to mitigate the effects of inflation\n\n15% use it to reduce their banking costs\n\nRespondents to the survey also suggest they trust Bitcoin as much as online banking or cash to protect savings:\n\n24% US respondents would place most trust in Bitcoin\n\nCompared with 25% who place most trust in online banks\n\n23% who place their trust in cash\n\n\u201cWhat this data shows is that we\u2019re reaching an inflection point in the understanding and embrace of crypto-currencies among early adopters in the US that reflects the global trend towards the Third Age of Bitcoin,\u201d said Rong Chen, co-founder, Elastos. \u201cWe are on the verge of Bitcoin delivering a new era commerce, where users are in charge of their data and are no longer beholden to the Web 2 tech giants. This data shows there is work to do to encourage broader adoption in the US, but at Elastos it is our mission to develop technologies that will make it easier to interact and transact with Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe BIT Barometer also revealed sizable constituencies uncomfortable with the data sharing requirements of Web2. Globally and in the US, one in three (31%) described themselves as \u201cuneasy\u201d or \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d about the requirement to share personal information to message or transact on web2 social media.\n\nAbout Elastos\n\nElastos is a public blockchain project that integrates blockchain technology with a suite of reimagined platform components to produce a modern Internet infrastructure that provides intrinsic protection for privacy and digital asset ownership. The mission is to build accessible, open-source services for the world, so developers can build an internet where individuals own and control their data.\n\nThe Elastos SmartWeb platform enables organizations to recalibrate how the Internet works for them to better control their own data.\n\nhttps://elastos.info\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/elastosinfo/\n\nElastos\u2019 BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation & Trust) Index Methodology\n\nThe data was compiled from over 1,400 self-defined \u2018tech savvy\u2019 respondents from 7 countries across the globe. The research was compiled from online interviews conducted in Brazil, Germany, Nigeria, South Korea, UAE, UK, and US. The interviews were completed by a third party, registered market research company and completed between 30 March and 04 April \u201924.\n\nAbout BEVM\n\nBEVM is the first fully decentralized EVM-compatible Bitcoin L2 that uses BTC as Gas.

        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\nREAD ISIS Network Helped 400 Cross US Border Illegally - Many of Them Are Now Missing\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "title": "Tesla: Reality Vs. Hypothesis ('Bad News' Continues) (NASDAQ:TSLA)",
        "body": "Victor Golmer/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nTesla: The Hardships Of Opening A Debate On The Stock\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a stock I rarely write about. In fact, this is just my third article in over two years on Seeking Alpha. This doesn't mean I don't follow the company closely, as I am deeply interested in the automotive industry. Yes, here many would stop me and immediately tell me: \"What are you saying? Tesla is no car company, it is a tech company, an AI company, etc.\" and so on. As far as I have experienced, dealing with Tesla inevitably carries along a relationship with many investors who are also fans of the company. This makes what I am about to do extremely risky.\n\nSo far, I have dealt with the company by tackling the main issue I see behind it: to value it properly, investors must decide whether it is an automaker or a tech company. As for me, even though CEO Elon Musk says otherwise, I am on the automaker side, and I say this based on its financials.\n\nSince I follow many automakers, now and then I gather some news on the overall industry that makes me write some macro considerations. At the end of last year, after listening to Mercedes-Benz's earnings call, together with other big automakers such as Volkswagen and Stellantis, I wrote an article on the \"bad news\" that these companies were bearing for Tesla. As a matter of fact, it turns out that it indeed became rather difficult for Tesla, which dropped to the low $140s in late April. Since then, however, the stock has recovered a bit and now trades just below $190 thanks to an overall bull market and to a few announcements Elon Musk has made, recreating a new narrative around the stock thanks to the Robotaxi fleet.\n\nThe Issue With Cathie Wood's Forecast\n\nNow, after I read a few days ago that Ark Invest's Cathie Wood put a $2,600 price target on Tesla, I would like to share my view once again. We can see below the range of possible outcomes, with one caveat: autonomy will be the key. If now autonomy is released, then the stock will only go up to $350, which means the stock will in any case appreciate over 13% per year from here through year-end 2029. In any case, it seems it will be impossible to lose money on Tesla.\n\nARK Invest\n\nWhat will drive Tesla stock to these record highs? It won't be exceptional EV sales, which Ark Invest forecasts to make up only 25% of Tesla's sales by 2029. The true golden goose will be the robotaxi business, which could make up 63% of Tesla's revenues in 2029.\n\nARK Invest\n\nArk Invest's bear case scenario sees Tesla's market cap around $7 trillion by 2029, with 5.8 million cars sold generating $250 billion in revenue and $603 billion coming from autonomous ride-hail revenue.\n\nArk Invest believes Tesla will launch its robot-taxi service by 2026 and that the probability that Tesla fails to launch within 5 years is less than 0.01%.\n\nThen, suddenly, we find these words: \"While unlikely, if we were to eliminate the possibility of a robotaxi network from our model, our price target would be ~$350.\" However, Ark Invest is quick to note that, even in the case of no robotaxi launch, Tesla could \"launch a human-driven ride-hail service for both strategic and tactical reasons.\"\n\nTesla is expected to have a take rate of around 50%, against Uber's 25%.\n\nSince Ark Invest has to face the reality of flat vehicle production in 2024, it then projects a 45% CAGR growth through the end of 2029, scaling from 1.8 million units to around 11 million by 2029. But most of these sales will come from robotaxis, which should ease manufacturing scaling because of their simplified design.\n\nThe thesis on Tesla then becomes the following: \"Its business model should transform from one-off vehicle sales to a recurring revenue base as every car becomes an AI-powered cash flow generation machine.\"\n\nWhat should we make of these predictions?\n\nWell, Tesla CEO Elon Musk did announce that on August 8th, he will unveil the Robotaxi, stating \"It will result in a cost per mile cheaper than subsidized bus tickets.\" True, originally it was predicted to be available in 2020. We don't yet know if the unveiling date will immediately lead to production, or if Tesla will need more time before developing it fully. However, it seems Tesla is moving forward and should soon produce this long-awaited product.\n\nThis announcement was surprising and surely sparked a lot of interest, as Tesla was rumored just a few months ago to have canceled its plans to mass-produce a $25,000 EV. After all, the inevitable price battle Tesla was fighting with BYD and other Chinese EV makers was squeezing Tesla's margins and leaving less room for massive investments with lower returns.\n\nHowever, it seems now that Tesla has combined the $25,000 car project with the Robotaxi, developing one model with two uses.\n\nDuring the last earnings call, Elon Musk was able to spark once again interest in this project, explaining how he thinks about the fleet:\n\nthink of it as some combination of Airbnb and Uber, meaning that there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet. There will be some number of cars and then there'll be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the end user. That end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want, and they can decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family or only by 5-star users or by anyone at any time they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like an Airbnb. You could rent out your guest room or not, any time you want. So as our fleet grows, we have 7 million cars going to \u2013 9 million cars going to, eventually tens of millions of cars worldwide. With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data and you get this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google Search has the sort of flywheel, it's very difficult to compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking and Google is getting that feedback loop. It\u2019s the same with Tesla.\n\nNow, as far as this may sound interesting, I found it strange that the leader of such a worldwide known brand as Tesla needs to compare its company to Uber (UBER) and Airbnb (ABNB) as if the only way of explaining what he has in mind comes from what two other companies are already achieving. Of course, he named the two companies to make things easier to understand, but, still, it is a way of communicating that weakens Tesla.\n\nSurely, another interesting development is that Robotaxi's fleet will be flexible and will lead to transportation as a service economy, where owning a vehicle won't be as necessary as it still is now.\n\nHowever, Tesla won't have a monopoly. Zoox, acquired by Amazon in 2020, will be competing, and it has already been testing its taxis in San Francisco and Las Vegas, but it has yet to start commercial rides.\n\nGoogle is not idle either, with Waymo already operating a commercial ride service in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and it is currently the largest U.S. robotaxi service with over 500 electric Jaguar SUVs. It is estimated that Google spent around $8 billion so far on this project to generate, as of now, just $50 million a year (the average price per ride is around $20). However, just two years ago, Waymo made only $1 million.\n\nNow, $8 billion is a lot of money, and this is what was needed so far just to get the project started. Imagine the huge capex that will be needed to scale the project up. Of course, enthusiasm may be so high that financing won't be difficult. But, still, Tesla made just $5 billion in FCF last year and will probably do less this year due to decreasing margins. Simply put, Tesla doesn't have the money to self-fund this business.\n\nTesla claims its new FSD will now be using just cameras, avoiding laser LiDAR systems. This clashed with what Luminar (LAZR) disclosed in its Q1 2024 report when it wrote \"Tesla was our largest LiDAR customer in Q1, comprising over 10% of our revenue.\" It is important to know that it has taken Waymo around 6 years to cover a 315 sq mi region.\n\nAs a result, I see the robotaxi project in this way. I am confident that Tesla and some other companies will eventually figure out a way to launch this business successfully. However, before we see any material revenue change from this business, many years may pass (perhaps even a decade). In Ark Invest's forecast, I see no real grounds on which the robotaxi expectations are founded, especially technologywise.\n\nNow, without repeating what has already been well said on Seeking Alpha, I suggest reading a recent article by Dividend Sensei where he shows how the economics of robotaxis for Tesla don't make sense under the scenario of a $0.50 cost per mile. He estimates a staggering $45.4 trillion will be needed to fund a global robotaxi fleet. Obviously, he states, Tesla can't fund this by itself, not even if the stock goes up 10 times and Tesla sells its shares.\n\nTesla's Automotive Business: Profitability Under The Radar\n\nHaving said this, I have tried to show why I keep considering Tesla as part of the larger auto industry. True, it is no normal player in this industry, as it owns leading technology in electric mobility. However, it is neither a monopolistic player nor a company whose future will soon be impacted by some disruptive change. In a sort of way, if I will be allowed to use this as an example, Tesla is similar to Google, which reports after its main and well-established business lines, the item \"other bets.\"\n\nIt is difficult to predict what will come out of this and, as such, investors don't consider this when valuing the company. The same is true for Tesla: be it semis, robotaxi, batteries, energy storage, or other bets, it is extremely difficult to predict when these bets will become business and, most importantly, will generate profits. Probably, the most realistic new stream of revenue will come from its charging business, currently generating 1.5% of total revenue. And yet, when Tesla announced a 10% workforce reduction, the supercharger unit was hit the most.\n\nAt the same time, 2024 has been so far hard for EV sales, with only a 7% increase globally, but just a +2% YoY growth in the U.S. China, on the other hand, remains the global leader in EV sales with its local players gaining momentum.\n\nCounterpoint Research\n\nAt the same time, consumers appear to be shifting towards cheaper PHEVs. Here Chinese players such as BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF), Li Auto (LI), and Geely (OTCPK:GELYF) excel. In China alone, PHEV sales increased 83%, and even though they are still outsold by BEVs by 2 to 1, the fast growth in sales could be setting a new trend among consumers.\n\nIf this trend strengthens, Tesla will see its market shrink or at least grow at a slower pace because Tesla has committed to fully electric cars. I don't think Tesla will ever consider plug-in hybrids because they collide with its ultimate goal of sustainable mobility. Tesla's Chinese competitors, on the other hand, will have an advantage. BYD, for example, sold almost 1.5 million PHEVs out of 3 million vehicles sold in 2023.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla's sales in Europe dropped to less than 14,000 vehicles in April as other European and Chinese competitors are taking market share.\n\nEven Elon Musk, during the Q1 2024 earnings call, had to discuss \"several unforeseen challenges\" affecting the company's main business. For example, a year ago, it took only 25 days for U.S. dealers to sell a BEV, or \"days to turn,\" once it landed on their lots. This year, the days to turn are 72. ICE vehicles' turn moved up from 34 to 52. But hybrids are increasingly popular: last year their days to turn were 16, and now they are just 25, meaning demand for hybrids is strong. As a result, GM CEO Mary Barra decided at the beginning of this year to introduce PHEVs in the company's lineup, after discontinuing their last models in 2019.\n\nThe result was that Tesla reported negative FCF of $2.5 billion in the first quarter. Guess what the main reason was? Inventory build greater than deliveries. High inventories lead to price cuts. Price reductions have an impact on used EV prices, too. This has an impact on the financing branches of automakers, which may see the value of the cars they sold in the past two years decrease, creating a potential loss once they take back the used vehicle and resell it. As a matter of fact, as Recurrent showed in its Q2 2024 market report, used EV prices continue to fall.\n\nBut Tesla's financials were also hurt by several price cuts the company put into play to keep its sales up. This hasn't supported sales enough, and Tesla recently decided to trim its production output in China.\n\nTSLA Q1 2024 Earnings Presentation\n\nAs we can see from the three charts above, Tesla's key metrics still reveal the company is a capital-intensive industrial business: volumes are important and if they are not sustained, the company has a hard time generating cash flow and income.\n\nTotal automotive revenues in Q1 were down 13% and Tesla's gross profit decreased 18%, leading to a gross margin of 17.4%. But opex increased 37% and this ate away a lot of the company's operating margin, which was reported only at 5.5%. Now, this is very low. Many OEMs are currently reporting higher margins, though competing more fiercely compared to last year. Stellantis, (STLA), for example, is currently the second-best in BEV sales in Europe (after Volkswagen) and can already sell its BEVs at a profit. Overall, Stellantis has double-digit operating margins. Volkswagen is high-singe digits. General Motors TTM operating margin is over 7%. If Tesla will be once again a disruptive company, it can't just give up its margins because it needs plenty of cash to fund its new endeavors.\n\nEven Services, which is a key business for industrial companies, didn't perform well, with gross profit down 40% YoY. As Tesla reports: \"The biggest driver of gross profit reduction was lower used vehicle profit.\"\n\nValuation\n\nOn Seeking Alpha, Tesla's factor grades don't currently paint the perfect scenario to invest in the company. On one side - but it has been known for a long time - Tesla's valuation is extreme: a fwd P/E above 90, fwd EV/EBITDA around 40, and fwd P/FCF above 51 are expensive multiples. Investors are either saying they are willing to wait around 90 years to receive back in earnings what they are paying today or - which is more likely - are expecting explosive growth down the road so that these multiples will be quickly compressed.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWhile Tesla has been a growth story so far, we have seen how the current environment is making it hard for Tesla to come out flat YoY. As a result, Tesla's growth grade is nothing particularly exciting: a C-. Momentum and revisions are also two Cs. What stands out is Tesla's profitability. Although its gross profit margin is graded with a D-, it earns an overall A+ thanks to its high returns on equity, capital, and assets.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nAs many readers may know, I value a stock's profitability grade as the most important. Profitable companies can compound rather quickly, reducing at a fast pace its multiples, with a direct effect on valuation. However, even on profitability, I am a bit puzzled because, although Seeking Alpha gives Tesla an A+, most of its grades are between an A and a C+. So, I don't understand how the best possible grade comes out. In any case, Tesla's profitability is excellent. At least, it has been, up to now. As soon as this year ends and the new lower margins are taken into full consideration, we may probably see these grades decrease.\n\nFrom these grades, we have an overvalued company that is not supported by strong growth.\n\nIf I run a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") model, I find an even worse result. Although I project Tesla's FCF to grow 12% annually for the next five years and 6% as its perpetual growth rate, I end up with a target price of $43.\n\nAuthor, with data from SA\n\nEven if I project a whole decade of earnings, I end up - in the most rosy situation - with almost $170 billion in FCF. I have been generous and have used a 14% annual rate growth rate. However, Tesla's market cap is currently $626 billion. This means that the company is worth 5 times the sum of all the FCF it will generate in a decade. Now, to me, this is extremely expensive.\n\nPersonally, I am no short-side investor. I would never recommend shorting Tesla because it is a stock that can defy gravity and is rather unpredictable. However, I stick to my sell rating because Tesla's fundamentals currently seem to me to be weakening, while its prospects still depend a lot on a narrative that fails to show material and convincing signs of promising and profitable developments.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "title": "Big Opportunity At Bargain Prices, 2 REITs Yield Up To 8.5%",
        "body": "alfexe/iStock via Getty Images\n\nCo-authored with Hidden Opportunities\n\nReal Estate is often touted as the number one means of generating passive income. Its rise in popularity can be traced back to the post-World War II era, when Americans began buying homes for investment and ownership. In the 1970s, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) were formally established, allowing investors to buy shares in large-scale real estate portfolios to tap into rental income without direct property ownership and maintenance. Post the Global Financial Crisis, flipping homes became a trendy pursuit, popularized by TV shows and blogs. The modern era has bloggers, podcasters, and online forums highlighting house hacking as a viable strategy for new real estate investors. Additionally, the idea of listing an investment property or a portion of one's house on Airbnb (ABNB) has transformed the approach to drawing income from real estate.\n\nOwning tangible assets has tremendous benefits. Yet, owning physical property has several challenges that one must consider before diving in:\n\nIt is an illiquid investment that involves high costs to buy, set up, maintain, and sell. Moreover, depending on market conditions, you may not be able to sell at a desired price within a desired timeframe.\n\nProperty maintenance isn't everyone's cup of tea. Hiring a property manager significantly reduces your margins and could result in high costs and compromised quality of repairs. After all, a third party isn't going to look after your house as you would.\n\nLabor laws are complicated and subject to legislative changes. Evicting a difficult (or even non-paying) tenant can be quite difficult. Even the largest landlords struggle when tenants file for bankruptcy. If you choose to only invest in properties of your home state (or province) due to better familiarity with local laws, you are setting yourself up for a geographically concentrated portfolio.\n\nPutting it all together, the investment isn't as passive as it sounds. This is why I am a bigger proponent of REITs. These investment vehicles offer investors the benefits of real estate investment, including regular dividend income, transparency, liquidity, inflation protection, and portfolio diversification.\n\nU.S. REITs continue to navigate the environment of quantitative tightening from a position of strength. As of Q1 2024, 89.6% of public REIT debt carried fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and a 6.5-year term to maturity. 60% of them beat FFO/share estimates and over two-thirds reported YoY growth in NOI, with the average annual rise being 2.8%.\n\nREIT fundamentals remain strong, and we are optimistic about the sector valuation upside with rate cuts. Let us now look at two bargain picks from this income-focused sector.\n\nPick #1: CCI - Yield 6.5%\n\nWe have discussed extensively the moat and inelastic demand enjoyed by the U.S. telecom sector, which includes industry leaders like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). In this rapidly evolving digital ecosystem, individuals will be using a growing number of internet-connected devices, guzzling more data each year. This makes the infrastructure supporting broadband and wireless networks extremely vital for the digital future. The U.S. is particularly a terrific market for telecom operators due to the trifecta of high population (with tech penetration), high data consumption, and high ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) compared to other countries.\n\nCrown Castle Inc. (CCI) is a telecom infrastructure REIT that owns, operates, and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and ~90,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions across every major U.S. market. CCI's largest tenants are T-Mobile (TMUS), AT&T, and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for ~75% of its FY 2023 consolidated site rental revenues. Tower REITs are highly profitable since they can rent the same infrastructure to all the telecom companies at the same time. Source\n\nInvestor Presentation\n\nWhile this is normally a terrific benefit, it has its certain rare drawbacks. The TMUS - Sprint merger has been a headwind for CCI, since the combined company is rationalizing its network footprint. When they were separate companies, they were tenants of CCI separately, leasing the tower infrastructure. But with the consultation, they don't need to rent the same infrastructure twice, and CCI expects ~$200 million of revenue to come off their books by 2025. The market has reacted very negatively to this event-driven headwind, with CCI's valuation deflating from the 25x FFO in 2022 to half that multiple currently.\n\nWe anticipate that this consolidation will result in approximately $200 million in Towers non-renewals in 2025. We expect an additional impact of $35 million in Fiber non-renewals, with $10 million impacting results in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. Excluding the anticipated impact from the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation, we expect each of towers and small cell non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1 to 2% of their respective annual site rental revenues. - 10-K\n\nCCI recently announced operational changes to enhance returns in fiber solutions and small cells. As part of these changes, the company expects lowered Capex on lower-return opportunities in 2024 by $275 - $325 million while maintaining expectations for revenue growth across towers, small cells, and fiber solutions in the years ahead. The company also announced efforts to reduce over 10% of its staff in the fiber business and updated its FY 2024 outlook. The most notable adjustment is the upward revision of AFFO per share, between $6.91 - 7.02/share and higher adj. EBITDA of ~$4.1 billion. CCI pays a $1.565/share quarterly dividend, a 6.5% annualized yield. This dividend is placed at a ~90% payout ratio, based on the midpoint of the revised AFFO estimate. Source\n\nPress Release\n\nCCI maintains a five-year dividend CAGR of 7.6%, and its most recent payment hike was by 6.5% in October 2022. The telecom infrastructure REIT maintains a strong balance sheet with investment-grade ratings from leading credit agencies. During Q1, CCI increased the percentage of its fixed-rate debt from 68% to 90% and extended its weighted average maturity term from five to seven years. The REIT also decreased the percentage of secured debt from 47% to 6%. CCI's staggered debt maturity schedule has ~$2. billion maturing between now and the end of 2025. With over $6 billion in liquidity from its credit facility, CCI is well-positioned to tackle upcoming maturities.\n\nTelecom infrastructure is a highly regulated sector with very few players controlling the market share. CCI trades at a 13.8x Price/FFO ratio, placing it in the undervalued territory when compared with 16x for SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC) and 18x for American Tower Corporation (AMT), its closest (and only) significant peers. CCI is the fifth-highest-yielding component of the S&P 500 and a significant holding in Bill Gates' investment portfolio, generating ~$9 million in annual dividend income.\n\nWe have a second pick that makes a good fit for those seeking a higher degree of diversification in REIT investing.\n\nPick #2: RQI - Yield 8.5%\n\nCohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund (RQI) presents an attractive way to invest in REITs and get paid to wait. The CEF (Closed-End Fund) has 196 holdings with 81% / 19% split of REIT common stock and preferred equity. RQI's top ten holdings are some of the largest, most prominent REIT leaders in their respective domains, representing ~52% of the CEF's assets. Source\n\nRQI Fact Sheet\n\nRQI operates with ~30% leverage, with 81% of the debt fixed at an eye-popping 1.6% with a weighted average duration of 2.37 years. As we near the end of QT, REITs are well-positioned to experience valuation improvements, and RQI in turn will see NAV improvements. The leverage will provide tailwinds for this, allowing the CEF to naturally deleverage or optimize its debt at favorable terms.\n\nThe power of active management and steady distributions is evident in RQI's consistent outperformance (without any distribution reinvestment) against the benchmark Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ) over the past year.\n\nData by YCharts\n\n\u2026the past five years\u2026.\n\nData by YCharts\n\n\u2026and the past ten years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nFor your tax considerations, over the past 4 years, distributions from RQI have been primarily capital gains, averaging ~58% of the payments. About 23% was categorized as ordinary income, with ~8% being qualified. An average of 19% of the distributions have been eligible for the 199A deduction, and there has been zero ROC.\n\nRQI has done well maintaining its NAV through a volatile interest-rate environment while paying $0.96/share to investors, a +8% return.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nRQI trades at a 7% discount to NAV, making your dollar buy more of its quality REIT assets. The CEF pays $0.08/share every month, calculating to a healthy 8.5% annualized yield.\n\nConclusion\n\nREITs offer investors the benefits of real estate investment along with the liquidity, ease, and affordability of transactions via the public markets. REITs have historically provided investors with consistent dividend income, competitive market performance, inflation protection, and portfolio diversification. High-quality REITs have experienced management teams to oversee the day-to-day operations, management, and maintenance of the properties. Regulations stipulate that these organizations must distribute 90% of their earnings to shareholders, ensuring steady income for shareholders.\n\nAmidst higher borrowing costs, REITs are deeply undervalued, and the market is underestimating their balance sheet health and growth potential. Investing in REITs is an excellent way to expand into real estate without any of the hassles of owning and managing a property yourself. CCI is an attractive way to draw income from the moat and indispensable nature of communication infrastructure, while RQI provides more diversified access to leading operators of data centers, storage, industrial, healthcare, and retail properties.\n\nREITs are an essential asset class in our investment philosophy. We maintain a comprehensive portfolio spanning several income-oriented sectors, targeting a +9% overall yield. We get paid for our time in the market, so we never need to time the market for our retirement needs. This is the essence of income investing.",

        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the technology sector right now, and one company that stands to benefit greatly is e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Roughly halfway into 2024, shares of Amazon have soared by 23% -- handily topping the 15% year-to-date gain of the S&P 500 and the 19% rise of the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nYet even in the wake of this strong performance, Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan Chase thinks Amazon stock could rocket by another 28% over the next 12 months.\n\nAmazon's cash-flow empire\n\nTwo of the most closely followed institutional investors are Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.\n\nAdmittedly, Wood and Buffett don't have a lot in common when it comes to their investment styles. Buffett's portfolio is dominated by blue chip businesses with consistent cash flows. By contrast, Wood often takes positions in companies that operate in emerging technologies such as genomics, space exploration, and different aspects of the tech realm.\n\nOne stock that they both own, though, is Amazon. While those positions are relatively small compared to their other holdings, I'm intrigued that these two have any overlap across their respective portfolios.\n\nOne of the reasons that I think both Buffett and Wood own Amazon has to do with its cash flow. Many growth companies (especially in technology) burn cash for long periods in pursuit of accelerated revenue growth.\n\nAmazon, however, now generates a staggering level of profit. For the 12-month period that ended March 31, the company increased its operating cash flow by 82% year over year to $99 billion. Moreover, Amazon's free cash flow over that duration was a whopping $50 billion.\n\nWhile it's the company's robust free cash flow that likely attracts an investor like Buffett, it's how management is investing these excess profits that I think piques the interest of Wood.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThese AI investments should not be overlooked\n\nLike many of its big tech peers, Amazon has been aggressively pursuing all things AI over the last year or so.\n\nThe first major move the company made on that front was a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, a competitor to OpenAI. In addition, Amazon is an investor in machine-learning start-up Hugging Face. Moreover, back in April, the company announced an $11 billion infrastructure project to build out data centers in Indiana.\n\nI see all of these moves as pieces of a larger puzzle. Namely, all of these assets should play important roles as the company begins rolling out additional AI features across its ecosystem. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform stands to benefit greatly from these AI investments, as do its legacy e-commerce business and fast-growing advertising operation.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest in Amazon stock right now?\n\nWhile Anmuth's price target of $240 might tempt you to buy Amazon stock, I wouldn't get too hung up on particulars.\n\nInstead, investing in Amazon should be rooted more in a strong conviction that AI represents a new frontier for the technology sector at large. Moreover, allocating a position of your portfolio to Amazon would suggest that you're optimistic the company can emerge as a leader in the AI landscape.\n\nAs I've expressed in previous articles, given Amazon's diverse set of businesses and its ability to leverage AI across its ecosystem, I think the company is going to dominate for years to come.\n\nAMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nIf you look at the chart above, you'll notice something interesting about Amazon's price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple. Namely, the metric surged to excessive levels and then disappeared during 2022 and part of 2023. That is because Amazon was burning cash during this period, thereby rendering P/FCF meaningless.\n\nHowever, as the company currently generates consistent cash flow, the multiple has started to normalize. What I find most intriguing about the trend above is that the company's P/FCF multiple of 43 is about half its 10-year average.\n\nThis is hard to believe. Amazon is a much different, larger, and more sophisticated business today than it was a decade ago. However, the valuation trends above would imply that Amazon stock is more reasonably valued today at its current price.\n\nConsidering the long-term tailwinds AI represents, as well as the company's numerous investments in the space and the impacts these could have on its future prospects, I think buying Amazon stock right now is a no-brainer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks to Double Up on Right Now",
        "body": "Dividend stocks are an attractive option for many investors. In addition to capital appreciation, as these businesses grow and gain in value, they share their profits with shareholders via quarterly or sometimes monthly dividends. This can be especially attractive for those in or near retirement looking for additional income sources.\n\nLet's look at three dividend stocks that have reliable and growing dividends but are still growing and increasing value for shareholders. Based on their track records and prospects, these stocks are worth doubling up on right now.\n\nStarbucks\n\nIf asked to name a ubiquitous coffee chain, it's likely the answer would be Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). It's difficult to travel anywhere in the United States and not see one or more Starbucks locations, often with long lines of customers waiting to buy a variety of hot and cold coffee drinks.\n\nStarbucks currently has a dividend yield of 2.8%, close to the highest it's been in three years. This is due, in part, to the fact that the stock is trading 37% below its mid-2021 high.\n\nHowever, today's yield is also a result of Starbucks raising its dividend every year that it has been a public company. Over the past three years alone, it has increased its dividend by 27%.\n\nStarbucks had a rough second quarter of 2024 (ending in March). Results missed the market's expectations and the stock sold off sharply. That said, all companies go through rough patches, and they can sometimes be buying opportunities for investors.\n\nKinsale Capital\n\nWhereas Starbucks is a household name, Kinsale Capital (NYSE: KNSL) is a company many have never heard of. Kinsale is an insurance company in a specific industry niche called excess and surplus. The company's specialty is insuring things that are less common and more difficult to underwrite, like a skydiving company or axe-throwing business.\n\nKinsale has been very successful in this small corner of the insurance market. Over the past five years, its total return has been 354%, compared to the S&P 500's 101%. In addition to this market-beating stock's performance, Kinsale pays a dividend that currently yields 0.15%. That's not much to write home about, but considering the stock's performance, it's a nice bonus for investors.\n\nDespite its long-term performance, Kinsale stock is currently down 28% over the past few months, presenting a rare discount for investors. Some of this sell-off was due to the most recent earnings results when growth slowed slightly. However, there isn't much reason for concern. Kinsale still grew its revenue by 45% and its earnings per share (EPS) by 77% in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyman Hospitality Group\n\nFor investors looking for a stock with growth potential, a high dividend yield, and exposure to the real estate market, Ryman Hospitality Group (NYSE: RHP) could be a good opportunity. The company owns the popular Gaylord hotel chain, which are large hotels that cater to conferences and business meetings. It also owns entertainment properties in the Nashville area. Ryman is a real estate investment trust (REIT), which means it has to pay at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as a dividend.\n\nRyman had a rough go of it during the pandemic when travel came to a halt. This was particularly difficult for the company because so much of its business comes from large gatherings of people at conferences. As time has gone on, however, the REIT has recovered nicely from the pandemic shutdowns.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, Ryman's most recently reported quarter, things looked a lot worse than they were. Almost all reported metrics were down year over year, but that was more due to a very tough comparable period in 2023 than it was the business performance.\n\nIt makes sense to view Ryman's performance on a much longer timeline considering the impact of the pandemic and the company's impressive post-pandemic recovery. Over the long term, Ryman's growth has been impressive.\n\nRHP Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nRyman has a compelling dividend yield, currently at 4.2%. The company is continually investing in its hotel properties while also building out its entertainment portfolio. The stock has cooled off by about 18% from its early 2024 high, making shares a compelling buy at today's price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CLO Closed-End Funds: Baby Bonds And Preferred Offering Steady Income",
        "body": "Suchat longthara\n\nWritten by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist.\n\nLast fall, risk-free rates were climbing, and fixed-income instruments such as preferreds and baby bonds were also getting pressured lower. At that time, we had taken a look at some closed-end fund (\"CEF\") preferreds and baby bonds that trade publicly for the collateralized loan obligation (\"CLO\") CEFs.\n\nWhen risk-free rates move, it moves all other yields with it. Generally, the Fed has control of short-term rates by adjusting their target Federal Funds Rate. However, the longer-term risk-free rates move more on market demand and only loosely follow the Federal Funds Rate.\n\nYcharts\n\nAre These Still Worth Looking At For Income Investors?\n\nWhile the risk-free Treasury Rates have fallen from where they were last fall, that helped to ease pressure on these preferred and baby bonds that are offered by CLO funds. So, while they may not be just as appealing as they were then, they are still generally safer areas to invest in when one is looking for yield. They can deliver more predictable income because they are fixed-rate payers.\n\nThey are safer because the underlying funds that issued them would have to see massive failures or blow-ups for preferred and baby bonds to start seeing losses. Historically, there has never been a closed-end fund that has gone bankrupt.\n\nYes, it is quite true that during the Covid crash, the energy CEFs that were leveraged were hit particularly hard. Some liquidated at around the lows, but none went to $0. In hindsight, had those funds just stuck around, energy was set to rebound significantly, and some of those losses could have been recovered. That's a different subject, though, completely. The main point is that during that crash, several of these funds needed to deleverage, and that meant redeeming sizeable portions of the preferred and senior notes. In the case of Tortoise\u2014one of the main energy CEF sponsors\u2014not only were they redeemed at par, but they also had to pay a prepayment premium.\n\nThat brings up the other point of why these offerings are generally safer because of the 1940 Act placing greater regulations on these funds. They come with leverage limits terms of 50% for preferred and 33.3% for issued debt (that's public debt offerings, not credit facilities, which are privately negotiated between funds and the banks offering the credit.)\n\nA further consideration for preferred and baby bonds, is if the Fed is cutting rates in the next year or two, that would once again make these even more tempting yields. That, in turn, could push these to trade back closer to their face value. Even in some cases, if the Fed cuts enough, it is quite possible to see these trade above par value.\n\nOf course, these instruments don't come with risks or downsides, and they are subject to investment losses. Another factor to consider is that these are all rather small issuances, and that means liquidity with these selections is rather poor. That can make it difficult to get into a large position or get out if you are more of a trader looking to get in and out quickly.\n\nA downside could be that the upside can be limited, unlike the common shares of Oxford Lane Capital Corp (OXLC), Eagle Point Credit Co (ECC), Eagle Point Income Co (EIC), XAI Octagon Floating Rate & Alternative Income Trust (XFLT), OFS Credit Company (OCCI) and Carlyle Credit Income Fund (CCIF). Investors holding those could, in theory, see unlimited and unrestrained upside over the long term. Baby bonds and preferred are going to generally be more anchored to their face value, particularly those that come with maturities.\n\nIn reality, this hasn't been too much of a problem historically, as most of the CLO CEF share prices have declined over the long term.\n\nCLO CEF Price Returns (Seeking Alpha)\n\nBut that doesn't mean they haven't provided some decent returns. That then brings up the other point that the yields offered by the common are meaningfully higher as well. That results in total returns generally being positive despite share price deterioration.\n\nCLO CEF Total Returns (Seeking Alpha)\n\nThe trade-off for those higher yields is that those will be the first to be cut during an economic downturn when defaults are rising\u2014as we saw during Covid.\n\nStill, given all these considerations, I believe that baby bonds and preferred from the CLO funds could still be worth pursuing. Though, they may be more appropriate for long-term income investors looking for more secure income.\n\nUpdated Look At The Offerings\n\nHere is the breakdown of the baby bond and preferreds in the CLO space with data as of June 27, 2024.\n\nCLO CEF Preferred/Baby Bond Data (Author)\n\nPreferred/Baby Bond YTM Chart (Author)\n\nSince our prior update, we have two new offerings. That includes the Eagle Point Income Company 8% Series C Term Preferred Stock Due 2029 (EICC). These were issued on March 28, 2024, and the first call date is April 3, 2026, with maturity of April 30, 2029. This one pays monthly, and as is naturally the case with a higher yield environment now upon us, the annual coupon rate came out at 8% here.\n\nThe fund's other preferred enjoys a 5% (EICA) and 7.75% (EICB) fixed rate. Those were issued on October 19, 2021, and July 21, 2023, respectively.\n\nIt also includes an offering from the newer CLO CEF to the market, Carlyle Credit Income Fund (CCIF) and its Carlyle Credit Income Fund 8.75% Series A Term Preferred Shares Due 2028 (CCIA). This was formerly the Vertical Capital Income Fund but was taken over by Carlyle. Damon Judd has a more in-depth overview of that transition written up previously.\n\nThe CCIA offering was actually issued on October 19, 2023, and they issued some more to Eagle Point Credit on November 11, 2023. So, they should have been included in our prior coverage, but I had missed this one. It becomes callable on October 31, 2025, and matures on October 31, 2028.\n\nInterestingly, CCIA does come with the highest coupon rate of the entire group at 8.75%. That can also come to its benefit, as it is also the only one trading above its face value, currently at 103.20%.\n\nCCIA Trading Price (Seeking Alpha)\n\nEICC is also essentially at face value\u2014off by a penny as of the latest close\u2014thanks to its 8% issued yield being quite enticing relative to the other CLO CEF preferred offers.\n\nEICC Trading Price (Seeking Alpha)\n\nThe other offering that trades right at close to face value is Oxford Lane Capital Corp 6.75% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock (OXLCM) as it matures at the end of this month. These will be redeemed on July 1, 2024.\n\nOXLCM Trading Price (Seeking Alpha)\n\nWhen looking at Eagle Point Credit Company 6.75% Series D Preferred (ECC.PR.D), this is a perpetual preferred that does not come with a maturity. It becomes callable on November 29, 2026. However, it was issued late in 2021 when rates were at zero, and unless we go back to a zero-rate environment, it is likely that they won't be able to issue another cheaper form of preferred.\n\nTherefore, there is no likely a scenario where this issue would get called; this is at least given the current circumstances of the rate environment and the expected rate environment not going back to zero. That's why this one trades so far below face value relative to the rest of these offerings.\n\nThe benefit of that is investors looking to take the plunge currently and put some capital to work, they are going to get a current yield of 8.64%. That's higher than what CCIA offers at this time, with its current yield sitting at 8.48%.\n\nECC.PR.D Trading Price (Seeking Alpha)\n\nOf course, for CCIA, investors have to factor in that they will also be losing $0.80 come maturity due to trading at $25.80. That then shifts the yield to maturity down to 7.88%.\n\nThe highest yield to maturity currently comes from Oxford Lane Capital Corp 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred (OXLCP) with its 8.94% YTM. The current yield might not be the most exciting at 6.68%, but it matures in 2.7 years. Investors who have a bit of patience to collect a relatively lower current yield in favor of some upside would be rewarded. Of course, that means betting OXLC would have to survive another 2.7 years as well.\n\nOXLCP Trading Price (Seeking Alpha)\n\nConclusion\n\nBaby bonds and preferreds can offer some safer sources of cash flow for income-focused investors. They might not be the most exciting, but all one is doing is betting that these funds survive\u2014they don't have to thrive. Yields have come down some since last fall when risk-free rates were ripping higher. Still, they can be a generally more reliable source of steady yield for investors as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

        "title": "Argenx: Strong Setup For Outperformance In 2025 (NASDAQ:ARGX)",
        "body": "Pavel Kot/iStock via Getty Images\n\nShares of argenx (NASDAQ:ARGX) rose after the company announced the FDA approval of Vyvgart Hytrulo for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (\u2018CIDP\u2019). The product label is broad and clean, and the estimated net price per patient per year is much higher than the estimated net price for generalized myasthenia gravis (\u2018gMG\u2019) patients due to the higher dosing frequency as the price per dose is the same.\n\nThe share price of argenx is up 17% since I upgraded it to strong buy in early February and where I outlined the strong commercial performance of Vyvgart and the advancing pipeline.\n\nThe approval represents the best-case scenario for Vyvgart and it considerably expands the addressable market for Vyvgart. The stage is now set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond, driven by the CIDP approval, the potential approval of a prefilled syringe Vyvgart, continued growth in gMG, and pipeline maturation led by Vyvgart, empasiprubart, and the next wave of clinical candidates.\n\nCIDP approval of Vyvgart brings a broad label and high net price\n\nIt looks like argenx got everything it wanted from the FDA, and that is not surprising considering the strong phase 3 results Vyvgart generated last year.\n\nThe label looks broad with no limitations and with no new safety warnings.\n\nArgenx expects the net price of Vyvgart for CIDP patients to be approximately $450,000 per patient per year and this is roughly double the price of Vyvgart for gMG patients. The price per dose is the same, but the difference is the more frequent, chronic dosing for CIDP patients versus episodic treatment of gMG patients.\n\nThe company estimates there are approximately 48,000 CIDP patients in the United States, but it will initially target 12,000 patients who are currently not well controlled on other drugs, and whose disease is progressing. This is a near $5.5 billion a year opportunity in the United States alone, and over time, I expect argenx to expand its reach beyond the 12,000 patients it is initially targeting.\n\nargenx investor presentation\n\nOf course, that does not mean all 12,000 patients will switch to Vyvgart, but based on the total addressable population and higher than expected net price per patient per year, I expect Vyvgart\u2019s peak annual sales in CIDP in the United States to approach or exceed $3 billion, and that global peak sales will be in excess of $4 billion (including U.S. sales). This is my current estimate based on the success-to-date in the gMG population, the higher net price and size of the CIDP market.\n\nManagement has been cautious about the launch cadence of Vyvgart in CIDP versus gMG because of competition in the form of IVIg (intravenous immunoglobulin) which is the primary treatment option for CIDP. Given the severity of the disease, CIDP patients tend to stick to IVIg and the company anticipates it will be harder to switch to Vyvgart, and that is why the initially targeted population is the 12,000 patients not doing well on existing options or progressing despite receiving IVIg.\n\nEven so, the much higher price for CIDP, the unmet need, the significant prescriber base overlap and the higher physician familiarity with Vyvgart should result in a strong launch. Based on these factors, I expect Vyvgart to match or exceed the gMG launch sales numbers. In other words, I expect incremental contribution of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2024 (gMG U.S. sales were $94 million in the first two quarters on the market) and I expect CIDP to contribute more than $700 million in net sales in 2025 (gMG U.S. sales were $723 million in launch quarters three through six).\n\nHowever, we may not be able to track the CIDP launch with such precision because the company will not provide sales per indication. Even so, with the relatively steady growth trajectory of Vyvgart in gMG since launch, we should have a pretty good idea of how the CIPD launch is going, and management also promised to provide some preliminary launch metrics on earnings calls.\n\nFiling for prefilled syringe completed in June \u2013 another market expansion opportunity\n\nArgenx also said last week that the filing to the FDA for the prefilled syringe (\u2018PFS\u2019) Vyvgart Hytrulo was completed in June. There is no PDUFA date for this kind of submission, but it is reasonable to expect to see the PFS approved in the first half of 2025, at the latest, and as soon as the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe PFS should allow self-administration of the subcutaneous version of Vyvgart in the United States, and it represents the next step for market expansion through improved convenience as some patients may not want to go to physicians\u2019 offices every week to get their injections administered by a healthcare provider.\n\nHowever, longer-term, PFS is a must-have option rather than a growth driver because this is where the competition is headed \u2013 fast followers such as Immunovant (IMVT) are already developing convenient subcutaneous anti-FcRn antibodies that will be self-administered as opposed to the currently available IV-administered Vyvgart and healthcare provider administered subcutaneous Vyvgart Hytrulo. As such, I consider this a predominantly defensive move by argenx.\n\nA timely approval of PFS should add another growth driver for argenx in 2025 and I would expect an incremental improvement in Vyvgart\u2019s growth trajectory in both gMG and CIDP indications.\n\nCIDP launch and PFS approval should drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond\n\nPutting the two growth drivers together should result in a very strong 2025. I believe the current Street revenue consensus for 2025 of $2.54 billion is very conservative.\n\nAs mentioned, I expect the U.S. launch of Vyvgart in CIDP to deliver more than $700 million in net sales in 2025, and this does not include ex-U.S. contribution for CIDP, although I expect it to be modest due to the launch timing and the need to secure reimbursement on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe gMG launch is still in the early stages, and based on the recent trends, I expect 2024 net sales to approach or slightly exceed $2 billion, inclusive of mentioned incremental $100 million contribution from the CIDP launch, and that global gMG net sales will be in the $2.4-$2.5 billion range in 2025, driven by continued growth in the U.S., greater uptake in Europe and other territories, continued geographic expansion and the expected availability of the prefilled syringe in the U.S.\n\nAdding the $700 million estimate for CIDP in 2025 results in a net sales range of $3.1-$3.2 billion. This may sound too aggressive based on the consensus numbers, but this is what I expect based on the available information.\n\nSuccessful new phase 3 trials outweigh failed phase 2 trials\n\nArgenx recently reported positive topline results of Vyvgart in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patients. No details were provided, but the company plans to advance Vyvgart into a phase 3 trial.\n\nCompetitor Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) did present the phase 2 results of its anti-FcRn candidate nipocalimab in Sjogren's syndrome, with strong efficacy of the higher 15mg/kg dose, and it is reasonably likely to assume that Vyvgart generated similar efficacy given the shared mechanism of action. Based on nipocalimab\u2019s data and argenx\u2019s statements, I believe this is another significantly de-risked indication for this class of drugs.\n\nEULAR presentation\n\nWe should see some data from Vyvgart\u2019s phase 2 trial in Sjogren\u2019s patients at the R&D day in mid-July.\n\nArgenx will also show additional data from the phase 2 trial of empasiprubart in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (\u2018MMN\u2019) at the R&D day next month and explain why these data support the advancement of this candidate into a phase 3 trial. I already wrote about empasiprubart in MMN in my February article, and I believe there is already sufficient evidence to advance it into a phase 3 trial.\n\nOn the negative side, argenx said last week that Vyvgart did not produce a desirable benefit in the phase 2 trial in patients with post-COVID-19 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or PC-POTS. Attrition of indications is to be expected, and while the discontinuation of PC-POTS does reduce the long-term upside, there is plenty of upside left for argenx based on what is currently de-risked, and there are plenty of additional shots on goal for Vyvgart, empasiprubart, and there is also the next wave of new early-stage clinical candidates about which we should hear more at the R&D day next month.\n\nRisks\n\nWith regulatory risk out of the way for Vyvgart in CIDP, the next important step is to secure the prefilled syringe approval for Vyvgart which would make argenx ready for the emerging competition with convenient subcutaneously administered anti-FcRn antibodies.\n\nCompetition remains the main long-term risk, and I believe the company has done well to address many of the upcoming threats \u2013 the mentioned prefilled syringe to address the convenience factor of fast follower competitors, but also the next-generation candidate ARGX-213 which is a potential improvement over Vyvgart, although we are yet to see the preclinical data that backs up those claims.\n\nThe other risks are in the clinic \u2013 as we have seen from last year\u2019s phase 3 failures of Vyvgart in immune thrombocytopenia and pemphigus vulgaris, and the recent failure in PC-POTS patients, Vyvgart will not work in all indications. In the near-term, the clinical readout risks are of Vyvgart in the three myositis subpopulations in the second half of the year.\n\nThe financial risk is low as Argenx is very well funded with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents and no debt at the end of the first quarter, and it is a few quarters from reaching cash flow breakeven.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe timely FDA approval of Vyvgart for the treatment of CIDP patients and the potential PFS approval to allow self-administration in the U.S., the expected approval of Vyvgart for CIDP in ex-U.S. territories, and continued geographic expansion set the stage for a very strong 2025 for argenx\u2019s commercial business. The current Street consensus for 2025 is $2.54 billion, and I believe it leaves a lot of room for outperformance, led by the mentioned growth drivers.\n\nIn the meantime, the pipeline should continue to progress and we should see a steady stream of mid- and late-stage trial readouts and commercial launches in the second half of the decade, from Vyvgart in thyroid eye disease, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, seronegative gMG patients (approximately 10% of the gMG population which the current label does not cover), to empasiprubart in MMN, other potential indications for both Vyvgart and empasiprubart, and the next wave of clinical candidates led by ARGX-213, the next-generation version of Vyvgart.",

Biden's age of 81 has been a hot button topic among voters concerned over whether or not he can continue to run the country.\n\n\"Biden's bumbling and stumbling performance amplified concerns regarding his capacity to serve and set off a new round of panic in the Democratic Party,\" Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research said in reaction to Thursday's debate. \"Trump won the debate and should be viewed as the clear front-runner this morning, but his demeanor and falsehoods appeared to underscore the concerns some voters have with his fitness for office.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden faced off in a debate Thursday evening. (AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nShares of DJT have been on a bumpy ride in recent months, oscillating between highs and lows.\n\nIn May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 a verdict that sent shares down 5% the day following the conviction.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n\nShares have fallen about 8% since the company's public debut at the end of March.\n\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms, although the former president almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social account throughout the trial.\n\nIn April, an updated regulatory filing showed Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.\n\nIn May, the company reported first quarter results that revealed losses of $327 million, mostly tied to expenses related to its SPAC deal. The company disclosed as of April 29 over 621,000 different shareholders owned stock in Trump Media, noting the \"vast majority\" of these were retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% stake in DJT. At Friday's opening price of around $38 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $5 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $3 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\n\nIn late April, the stock hit a milestone that secured Trump an additional $1.2 billion in cash. Stakeholders, however, are still subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A key concept every investor should grasp is the intrinsic value of a stock, which represents its true worth based on financial analysis, rather than its current market price.\n\nWhy Understanding Intrinsic Value Matters\n\n1. Informed Decision Making: Knowing the intrinsic value helps investors determine if a stock is undervalued or overvalued. Undervalued stocks present buying opportunities, while overvalued ones signal caution or a potential sell.\n\n2. Risk Management: Investing based on intrinsic value reduces risks. It ensures investments are made on solid financial grounds rather than market speculation or hype.\n\n3. Long-term Gains: Focusing on intrinsic value encourages a long-term investment perspective, reducing the influence of short-term market volatility and highlighting the true potential of investments.\n\nHowever, calculating a stock's intrinsic value isn't straightforward. It involves complex financial modeling, including discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, earnings multiples, and other valuation techniques. These require a deep understanding of financial statements, market conditions, and future growth projections, making it a daunting task for the average investor.\n\nSimplifying Intrinsic Value Calculation with InvestingPro\n\nThis is where InvestingPro comes in. InvestingPro is a powerful stock analysis tool designed to simplify the intricate process of determining intrinsic value. Its standout feature, Fair Value, automatically calculates a stock\u2019s intrinsic value using various financial models behind the scenes.\n\nThe Fair Value feature aggregates these different valuations to arrive at a realistic and error-free intrinsic value. This calculated fair value helps investors quickly assess whether a stock is worth their attention without getting bogged down in financial modeling complexities.\n\nImage Source: InvestingPro\n\nFor example, consider Axis Bank (NS: ). InvestingPro's Fair Value feature calculates its intrinsic value at INR 1,574 per share, using 5 financial models. With the current market price (CMP) at INR 1,265, there is a 24% upside potential. This insight helps traders recognize that buying this stock might not be the best decision, prompting them to look for better opportunities with positive valuation gaps.\n\nFor those who prefer a more hands-on approach, InvestingPro allows customization of these financial models. Users can adjust parameters to align the intrinsic value with their individual analysis, providing a tailored investment strategy.\n\nUnderstanding the intrinsic value of a stock is essential for making sound investment decisions. It helps identify undervalued opportunities, manage risks, and focus on long-term growth. Tools like InvestingPro, with its innovative Fair Value feature, democratize access to this critical analysis, making it easier for all investors to benefit from accurate and comprehensive stock valuations. Whether you\u2019re a novice investor or a seasoned professional, InvestingPro equips you with the insights needed to invest smarter and with greater confidence.\n\nSummer Sale: InvestingPro stands as a trusted ally for investors seeking invaluable insights into their investment decisions, trusted by thousands globally.

        "body": "(In paragraph 8, adds CEO as job title of Alan Waxman)\n\nBy Sinead Cruise and Tommy Reggiori Wilkes\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Sixth Street is embarking on the biggest European recruitment drive in its 15-year history, leasing a new regional headquarters in London's Mayfair and adding up to 20 employees this year for a push into private credit and real estate.\n\nJulian Salisbury, co-chief investment officer of the $75 billion global investment firm - which counts a number of ex-Goldman Sachs stars among its leaders - told Reuters the outlook for private markets in Europe was really strong.\n\n\"Because of the growing scale of firms like ours, a vibrant ecosystem of companies and entrepreneurs increasingly have the alternative to stay private longer or focus on growing their businesses with the support of long-term private investors,\" said Salisbury.\n\nSixth Street's European growth plan, reported here for the first time, is the latest example of ambition among U.S. investment firms to expand into less developed private credit markets. Ares Capital and Apollo Global Management (NYSE: ) have also become big players in the sector.\n\nThese investment firms are meeting demand from corporate borrowers that traditional banks are struggling to serve as a result of stricter rules on how much lending risk they can keep on their balance sheets.\n\nPrivate credit still represents just a fraction of the overall lending handed out by banks, but its rapid growth has spooked some regulators and financiers, who worry about the sector's relative lack of supervision and whether it could undermine financial stability.\n\n\"Tighter provisioning and capital requirements on banks mean it's more punitive for them to hold these assets now, so they want partners with whom to share that risk,\" said Salisbury.\n\nFounded in 2009, Sixth Street employs more than 600 people, including more than 200 investment professionals. Alan Waxman, Goldman alum, is a co-founder and CEO.\n\nCiting London's attractive talent pool, Salisbury said the city was the \"obvious first choice place\" from which to build the firm's international business, even though other cities were \"opening their doors and catching up\" post-Brexit.\n\nSixth Street employs around 60 staff in London and its new offices in Dover (NYSE: ) Street close to the Ritz Hotel has capacity to accommodate twice that number.\n\n\"We expect our business to grow a lot here,\" said Salisbury, who spent 25 years at Goldman before joining former colleagues at Sixth Street in February.\n\nWith UK national elections next week, British-born Salisbury said he hoped politicians would protect the UK financial services industry, which he described as a \"crown jewel\".\n\n\"We have had a local presence here since 2011 and are growing our international business. For now, that's focused around London, with Asia a future priority,\" he said.\n\nREAL ESTATE PUSH\n\nSixth Street has invested in businesses ranging from Airbnb to Bay FC, a professional women's soccer franchise.\n\nSixth Street launched its dedicated structured products business in March 2022. It hired New York-based Michael Dryden, former global head of securitised products finance at Credit Suisse to lead the team, which counts asset-backed finance as a particular market of interest.\n\n\"Private credit markets are expected to double over the next five years and we think there's organic growth potential across all our credit strategies,\" Salisbury said.\n\nThe company, which has also provided capital to Spanish soccer clubs Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, led the KKR-backed consortium that bought Greensky (NASDAQ: ), a lending platform for home improvement loans, earlier this year.\n\nSalisbury said bolstering the group's real estate business in Europe was another priority in 2024, after hiring Marcos Alvarado from Safehold (NYSE: ) Inc. in February to head its U.S. team.\n\nSixth Street resisted temptation for heavy investment in the down-markets of 2021 and 2022 and sold specialist lender Kensington Mortgages to Barclays two years ago.\n\nNow, it is ready to capitalise on bigger discounts being offered by sellers.\n\nRecent deals include buying, alongside other investors, a portfolio of Italian supermarkets and shopping malls valued at 258 million euros ($275.72 million).\n\n\"Real estate has become a real stock picker's market, with increasing divergence between winners and losers and a need to drive more returns through operating performance as opposed to simply levered yield trades,\" Salisbury said.\n\n($1 = 0.9357 euros)",

        "title": "Bristol-Myers Squibb: Time To Double Down (NYSE:BMY)",
        "body": "JuSun\n\nIntro & Thesis\n\nI initiated coverage of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stock about 3 months ago, in March 2024, with a \"Buy\" rating. At the time, I cited that the company's growth potential wasn't exactly what it was worth buying for, but the value it possessed seemed more durable. My calculations at the time led me to conclude that even under conservative assumptions, BMY stock could be undervalued by the market by about 14%, which, combined with a good dividend yield of over 5%, represented a good opportunity for income-seeking investors. Unfortunately, my thesis has so far failed to materialize as the stock has continued to test new lows:\n\nSeeking Alpha, my coverage of BMY stock\n\nAfter the continuation of such a rapid correction, I have decided to re-evaluate my thesis today - is it worth continuing to hold BMY? Moreover, is it worth buying the stock on this massive dip? My updated analysis says \"yes\" to both of these questions.\n\nWhy Do I Think So?\n\nAs I noted in my previous article, BMY is grappling with a significant internal crisis as several of its flagship drugs - Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo - are set to lose their exclusive patents by 2028. These drugs together account for ~64% of BMY's total revenue in Q1 FY2024 - this is a substantial portion, as you might imagine. Revlimid, for example, has already experienced a decline in sales following its patent expiration in 2022, with generic alternatives entering the market. This impending loss of exclusivity for key drugs is creating uncertainty for investors and is pressuring BMY's future revenue streams, contributing to its declining market cap amid stagnating Wall Street expectations & earnings revisions.\n\nSeeking Alpha, BMY\n\nSome of BMY's legacy products still bring in some growth. In Q1 we saw that BMY reported revenues of $11.9 billion, up 5% (6% adjusted for FX), mainly due to strong sales of Eliquis (+9% YoY), Reblozyl (+72%), and Opdualag (+76%). U.S. revenues - the main geography market for BMY - grew by 7% YoY to $8.5 billion, while international revenues held steady at $3.4 billion. What caught my eye was the continuation of margin contraction: BMY's GAAP gross margin fell from 77.4% to 75.3% due to product mix. In terms of OPEX, we saw how SG&A expenses rose significantly, by 34% YoY on a GAAP basis (+13% on a non-GAAP basis), primarily \"due to the timing of spending and recent acquisitions.\" The R&D expenses increased by 16% YoY on a GAAP basis (+6% non-GAAP), also reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher costs to support the overall portfolio.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nDespite the fact that acquisitions are perhaps one of the most important growth drivers for the coming years, they exert very strong pressure on earnings. BMY suffered a sizable net loss attributable to the Karuna acquisition (completed on March 2024), reporting a non-GAAP net loss of $8.9 billion, or negative $4.40/share, compared to net income of $4.3 billion, or $2.05 per share, in the year-ago period. Market expectations were around this level, so we can say that BMY met them (even exceeded in terms of sales).\n\nSeeking Alpha, BMY\n\nWhat the market definitely didn't like was the management guidance: BMY drastically lowered its 2024 adjusted EPS forecast to $0.40-$0.70 from the previous estimate of $7.10-$7.40, mainly due to \"the impact of acquiring Karuna and collaborating with SystImmune.\"\n\nBMY's IR materials, notes added\n\nAdditionally, BMY now expects a significantly higher effective tax rate of ~69%, up from the earlier estimate of 17.5%. Despite these challenges, as you may see above, the management still expects total revenues to grow at a low single-digit rate and maintain a gross margin of about 74%, which is good news for investors.\n\nI suspect the company will be able to quickly recover from the one-time EBITDA margin contraction in the first quarter, as it will not have to account for some prior period expenses, and will also begin implementing a cost reduction program designed to reduce BMY's costs by $1.5 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is executing a strategic productivity initiative that will drive approximately $1.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2025, the majority of which will be reinvested to fund innovation and drive growth. Source\n\nI also like what I see in BMY's product line and pipeline development. Here I should make a disclosure that I'm not an expert in healthcare, having no background in medical sciences and also no IB experience in this sector. But I think that you don't have to be a subject-matter expert to note basic trends based on ordinary logic.\n\nIn the oncology segment, BMY has made significant progress with the FDA approval of Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with other therapies for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Additionally, the FDA has accepted supplemental applications for Krazati (adagrasib) and AugtyroTM (repotrectinib), both of which are under priority review with a decision expected by mid-2024. I believe these developments are further evidence of BMY's active role in advancing oncology, which is a \"bottomless market\" in terms of TAM against the backdrop of the continued aging of the population in the U.S. and other developed countries.\n\nAccording to Dimension Market Research, the global oncology market size was valued at $234.6 billion in 2023. It's further anticipated to reach $533.2 billion by 2032 - a CAGR of 9.6% for the next 10 years.\n\nIn the field of hematology, BMY has also reached important milestones in the approval process: Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) was approved by both the European Commission and the FDA for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, representing a significant advance for patients with this difficult disease; similarly, Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel) received accelerated FDA approval for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The hematology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% for the next few years, according to SkyQuest Technology, and I believe BMY's strong presence and expertise in this market's niches can give the company the needed growth as its market share increases.\n\nDevelopments in immunology were mixed in Q1 as far as I can see. The first phase 3 trial for Zeposia (ozanimod) in Crohn's disease did not reach its primary endpoint, which isn't good. However, a silver lining is the long-term data from another study showing sustained efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. I think that Zeposia is a promising drug for neurological diseases, even if there are still some hurdles to overcome.\n\nPharmExec.com\n\nIn my opinion, what the company is going through now is a painful but necessary process. The costly acquisitions that are currently weighing heavily on Bristol Myers will eventually have to initiate the recovery of the stock. I sincerely believe this because we can already see from the results of the last quarter that the part of the company\u2019s portfolio consisting of new growth drugs is doing well. The one-off loss in the 1st quarter, which has severely impacted forecasts for the rest of the year, will no longer be relevant in 2025 and beyond, according to YCharts data and analysts' estimates. Therefore, the currently visible 75x in P/E or 25x in EV/EBITDA are not reliable benchmarks - in a year or two, BMY will have to trade much cheaper.\n\nYCharts, the author's notes added\n\nBut how cheap does BMY look today?\n\nIf your investment horizon is at least 2-3 years, then BMY looks like a bargain with an implied P/E multiple of only 6.1x for FY2025, considering that the 10-year median P/E ratio is over 29x.\n\nSeeking Alpha, the author's notes\n\nIt's obvious that the company had much faster growth in the past and was not burdened by the current risks. In those times of higher growth, P/E multiples of 20-30x were justifiable. Now, however, the company is struggling with its margins from quarter to quarter and taking more risks, still relying on old drugs and facing uncertainty about new drugs. Logically, its valuation multiples should be lower, but I assume BMY's P/E should still be ~10x once the earnings situation stabilizes. If my assumptions are correct, Bristol Myers Squibb stock should trade at ~$69.20 per share at the end of 2025 - this corresponds to an upside potential of 64% compared to the current stock price.\n\nMy current results are similar to the conclusions I came to last time when I created a DCF model in an optimistic scenario. The fact that the stock has continued to correct despite my conclusions on undervaluation does not bother me: the market has most likely simply reacted to the latest actual data and is not yet taking seriously what to expect from BMY in the next 2-3 years. The company is in a kind of \"prove it to me\" mode: whether the stock price starts to drift towards its fair value depends largely on sentiment and the quality of forwarding earnings (and positive surprises with solid guidance). I would recommend keeping a close eye on this.\n\nThe above calculated upside potential doesn't take into account the dividend yield, which will reward investors for their patience. In December 2023, the company increased its dividend by 5.3%, raising the quarterly payout to $0.60/share ($2.40 annually), so now it's yielding ~5.7% on a forwarding basis - this marks the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases and the 92nd consecutive year of dividend payments.\n\nSeeking Alpha, the author's notes\n\nAlso, BMY has a stock repurchase program with $5.0 billion remaining as of March 31, 2024, though no shares were repurchased in the first quarter - it can be assumed that the company will start to buy back its shares in view of the depressed valuation as earnings normalize, which should theoretically give the market a strong positive boost.\n\nIf we talk about the technical picture, we see that my bullish arguments are confirmed: On the weekly chart, we see that the stock price has not been able to consolidate below $40/sh and form a few wicks (which historically heralds the beginning of a reversal move). We also see an RSI divergence - it appears that sellers are losing strength very quickly.\n\nTrendSpider Software, BMY weekly, notes added\n\nFrom all this, I conclude that from a risk/reward perspective, it may be a good decision to double down on BMY stock right here.\n\nWhere Can I Be Wrong?\n\nAs I noted in my previous article, the first major risk to my thesis is the challenge for Bristol-Myers to bring new drugs to market. All prospective investors should understand that this process is both lengthy and expensive, often taking more than a decade and requiring heavy R&D. The success rate may be low, as only a small proportion of the drugs that enter clinical trials are eventually approved by authorities such as the FDA or the EU. It may take years for BMY to compensate for the loss of exclusivity for its current drugs with its pipeline of future drugs. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is under pressure to reduce drug prices, which further complicates BMY's efforts to commercialize its new products.\n\nRegarding the specific risk to BMY, I should also note that when I write above \"the costly acquisitions that are currently weighing heavily on Bristol Myers will eventually have to initiate the recovery of the stock\", I'm talking about my basic assumption. And every assumption in itself harbors risks. If BMY fails to integrate the newly acquired assets into its ecosystem fully, then its growth rates will not be sustainably higher than they are now, and therefore the market will not pay the multiple that I expect.\n\nMy assumptions about what the fair valuation multiple should be in 2025 and 2026 may turn out to be far from the truth if the company runs into problems integrating the recent acquisitions. Therefore, my fair value calculations are quite risky - you should be aware of that.\n\nThe conclusions of my technical analysis also carry risks - this is a rather subjective area of finance, which is very often no more effective in terms of the quality of conclusions than flipping a coin at random.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDespite current challenges and setbacks, I see the current period BMY is going through as a necessary phase. The company's product pipeline looks promising: Recent FDA approvals and priority reviews for drugs in oncology and hematology, along with positive long-term data for Zeposia in multiple sclerosis, tells me that the painful process of integrating costly acquisitions should eventually pay off, leading to stock recovery. With an implied P/E multiple of only 6.1x for FY2025, the stock looks undervalued compared to its historical average. Assuming stabilization, BMY could trade at around $69.20 per share by the end of 2025, a 64% upside from today. Also, BMY offers an attractive dividend yield of about 5.69% and has a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, which could boost investor returns. So given all these factors, it seems like a good time to consider investing in BMY.\n\nI reiterate my previous \"Buy\" rating for BMY.\n\nThank you for reading!",

        "title": "PALL: Could Supply Response Cause A Short Squeeze?",
        "body": "PashaIgnatov\n\nI have been a long-term bear on palladium prices and the abrdn Physical Palladium Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:PALL). In my opinion, the long-term decline in palladium prices is inevitable as its main industrial use is in gasoline catalytic converters, and gasoline internal combustion engine (\"ICE\") vehicles are increasingly being replaced with electric vehicles.\n\nSince I initiated on PALL, its shares have declined by over 24%, by far the worst performance amongst the precious metals compared to gold, as represented by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), silver, as represented by the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), and platinum, as represented by the abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF (PPLT) (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 - PALL has been worst performing precious metal (Seeking Alpha)\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, palladium markets have shown signs of life, briefly popping back above $1,000/oz. Is the recent rally in palladium prices sustainable, and are the fundamentals of the palladium market turning more positive?\n\nIn my opinion, the long-term picture remains unfavorable for palladium, as gasoline vehicles are increasingly being displaced with electric ones. However, in the short-run, a potential shuttering of Sibanye's U.S. operations could take ~5% of the global palladium production off the market, which could spark a short-squeeze in the futures market, as speculators are heavily short palladium futures. I am raising my rating on the PALL ETF to a hold, and will revisit if Sibanye follows through on their threat.\n\nBrief Fund Overview\n\nFirst, before we delve into discussions on the Palladium markets, it may be useful to remind users of the structure of the abrdn Physical Palladium Shares ETF. The PALL ETF is an investment trust that holds physical palladium bars in vaults in Zurich and London. The PALL ETF has $292 million in AUM and charges a 0.60% expense ratio (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 - PALL overview (abrdn.com)\n\nShiny Rock With Dwindling End Uses\n\nAs I have written previously, palladium is a precious metal with few industrial uses. According to research from Sprott Asset Management, the biggest end-use of palladium is in automotive applications as a catalyst in gasoline catalytic converters (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3 - Automotive applications make up 80-85% of end-use (Sprott Asset Management)\n\nHowever, as is well known by most investors, gasoline automobile production has been in terminal decline with the introduction of electric vehicles (\"EV\"). According to data from Bloomberg, the global economy reached 'peak' gas-powered vehicle sales in 2017 and has been in terminal decline ever since (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4 - Gasoline engine vehicle sales have been in terminal decline (Bloomberg)\n\nThis inevitable fact is the main reason why I have been so bearish on palladium and the PALL ETF. As demand from the automotive industry declines, there is no alternative market large enough to absorb the excess palladium production.\n\nSurprising Supply Response Coming Due To Low Prices\n\nIn my most recent article, I also discussed the dynamics of the palladium market and why I do not foresee any significant supply response, unlike other commodities.\n\nHistorically, palladium production is dominated by a few mines and producers, with Russia and South Africa controlling 46% and 39% of global reserves respectively (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 - Global palladium reserves (Sprott Asset Management)\n\nFurthermore, since palladium is typically produced as a byproduct from mining other precious and semi-precious metals like silver and copper, supply-side response is virtually non-existent. When palladium prices surged in the 2010s, copper and silver miners did not increase primary production to garner more palladium credits (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 - Palladium supply is price-inelastic (Sprott Asset Management)\n\nSimilarly, even as prices plunged in the past few years due to lower demand, copper and silver miners did not curtail their primary production because palladium credits were reduced.\n\nHowever, in recent days, we have received some surprising news that Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW) is considering shuttering its palladium mine in Montana if prices do not improve. This is a major development that is underappreciated by the market.\n\nAs a reminder, Sibanye is one of the few primary Platinum Group Metal (\"PGM\") producers with a substantial share of the global mining reserves of PGM metals (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 - Sibanye reserves overview (SBSW investor presentation)\n\nIf Sibanye shutters its US production, that could potentially take 0.5Moz of production out of the ~10 Moz market, or ~5% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 - Sibanye US produces ~0.5Moz of PGMs annually (SBSW investor presentation)\n\nFutures Positioning Primed For A Squeeze\n\nIf Sibanye follows through with its threat, we could see a substantial squeeze in palladium prices, as commodity speculators are very short palladium futures currently (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9 - Palladium price vs. futures positioning (macromicro.me)\n\nWho are these futures speculators net short palladium? In recent years, we have seen a rise in the assets under management (\"AUM\") of Commodity Trading Advisors (\"CTAs\") that take large bets on commodity futures. The rise of CTA AUM has led to increased volatility in commodity markets, culminating in the epic rally in cocoa and coffee futures earlier this year and the largest short position on record in palladium futures.\n\nThe problem with CTAs is that they are momentum traders; i.e. they buy assets that are rising and short assets that are declining. Readers are advised not to stand in front of the potential CTA freight train. If/when palladium prices start to gain traction due to short covering, the reversal in CTA positioning could quickly overwhelm any bearish fundamental story like the decrease in demand due to EVs.\n\nReduced Substitution Also A Net Positive\n\nAnother net positive for palladium prices is that with palladium trading at less than $1,000/oz, the substitution of palladium for platinum in catalytic converters may go into reverse, providing some support to palladium prices (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 10 - Palladium and platinum prices are reaching parity (reuters.com)\n\nOf course, substitution is a slow process, as it is primarily a decision made during the production of new vehicles. However, over the long run, price parity between platinum and palladium should be a modest net positive for palladium prices.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the long-term demand picture for palladium remains negative due to waning auto demand, a supply response from one of the largest PGM miners globally could spark a short-covering rally in palladium prices, with COT futures short-positioning at a historical level. I am raising my rating on PALL to hold, and may revisit the PALL ETF if Sibanye follows through on its threat to shutter production in its U.S. operations.",

        "body": "On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its stance on Nike Inc (NYSE: ), reducing the price target to $100 from the previous $118 while retaining an Outperform rating on the shares. The revision follows Nike's recent release of guidance that did not meet expectations, prompting a reevaluation by the analyst.\n\nThe analyst from BMO Capital expressed concerns over Nike's forward-looking statements, questioning whether the company had set a realistically low bar or if there were deeper issues not fully addressed. The guidance provided by Nike was described as \"materially underwhelming,\" leading to uncertainty about the company's financial trajectory.\n\nThe discussion centered on whether the problems Nike faces are related to brand management or if they stem from an excess inventory that must be cleared. The analyst pondered the likelihood of improvement in trends and questioned the potential impact on revenues for the entire fiscal year.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, BMO Capital chose to maintain an Outperform rating on Nike's stock. The analyst believes that with the right strategic moves, Nike has the potential to turn its business around. However, there was an explicit acknowledgment of skepticism regarding whether the current strategy in place could achieve the desired results.\n\nThe analyst's remarks underscore the complexity of the situation at Nike, highlighting the challenges the company may face in the near future. While the Outperform rating suggests a belief in Nike's long-term prospects, the reduced price target indicates a cautious outlook for the company's performance in the short term.\n\nIn other recent news, Nike, a leading player in the athletic apparel and footwear market, has been the subject of several adjustments by analyst firms. TD Cowen lowered Nike's price target to $75 due to growing competition in the sector and concerns about future growth, while Williams Trading cut its target to $67, citing weak demand. Additionally, JPMorgan downgraded Nike's stock from 'Overweight' to 'Neutral', reducing the price target to $83. Evercore ISI also adjusted its outlook, cutting the price target to $105, but maintained an 'Outperform' rating.\n\nThese revisions follow Nike's recent earnings report, which revealed an adjusted earnings per share of $1.01, exceeding expectations. However, the company experienced a year-over-year decline in revenue of 1.7%, falling short of the anticipated 0.5% increase. Nike's updated financial forecast for fiscal 2025 suggests a decrease in revenue for the first quarter, first half, and full year, but anticipates a rebound in its Lifestyle categories during the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nThe company's revised guidance also impacted other players in the athletic apparel and footwear market, such as JD (NASDAQ: ) Sports, Puma, and Adidas (OTC: ). Analysts from Kepler Cheuvreux suggest that Nike's adjusted business strategy could present Adidas with an opportunity to expand its market share. Despite the challenges, Nike remains focused on innovation and strategic initiatives for future growth.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nIn light of BMO Capital's recent price target adjustment for Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), current InvestingPro data provides additional context. Nike's market capitalization stands at a robust $142.17 billion, reflecting the company's substantial presence in the market. The P/E ratio, a key indicator of market expectations of growth and profitability, is currently at 25.25. This valuation, while on the higher end, is supported by Nike's consistent dividend increases over the past 22 years, a testament to its financial stability and commitment to shareholders.\n\nDespite concerns raised by analysts, Nike continues to be a prominent player in the Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods industry. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, indicating a healthy financial structure. Moreover, with liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations, Nike demonstrates a strong liquidity position, which is crucial for navigating the current uncertain market conditions.\n\nFor investors looking for more detailed analysis and additional InvestingPro Tips on Nike, which include metrics such as low price volatility and a moderate level of debt, visiting the dedicated page on Investing.com provides a deeper insight.

        "body": "On Friday, Stifel, a financial services firm, revised its price target for Accolade Inc. (NASDAQ:ACCD), a healthcare technology company, from $13.00 to $8.00, while reaffirming a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment follows Accolade's announcement of first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which met expectations excluding performance guarantees.\n\nThe company has also revised its revenue guidance for the fiscal year ending in February 2025, lowering expected growth from the previously forecasted 16-20% to a new range of 11-15%. However, there was no alteration to the projected EBITDA, which remains at an increase of $15-20 million. Accolade's management is now focusing on profitability over growth due to the escalating costs of customer acquisition, particularly in the rapidly growing segments that are driven by usage fees, such as Value-Based Primary Care (VPC), Expert Medical Opinion (EMO), and others.\n\nUsage fees, which account for approximately 30% of Accolade's revenue and are more variable, are anticipated to grow by 20%, a decrease from the previous 30%+ growth rate. Meanwhile, the core advocacy segment of the business, which is more recurring and represents 70% of revenue, is expected to maintain a growth rate of 9-10%, consistent with prior forecasts and compared to a 15% growth rate in fiscal year 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Accolade has guided to mid-teen revenue growth in the coming years, with profit margins expected to expand by 300-400 basis points annually. While Stifel finds the margin guidance reasonable, the firm has adopted a more conservative stance on revenue growth, modeling low double-digit (LDD) increases.\n\nFollowing the release of the updated guidance, Accolade's stock experienced a 27% decline in after-market trading, valuing the company at approximately 4 times Stifel's estimated EBITDA for fiscal year 2026. The reduction in guidance has led to additional questions regarding the sustainability and secular growth of the company, with a \"glass half-empty\" view being understandable among investors.\n\nThe next significant indicator for Accolade's performance will be the third-quarter results, which will mark the end of the selling season. Despite the recent adjustments, Stifel continues to believe that Accolade has the potential to achieve double-digit growth and generate mid to high teen EBITDA margins over time, which supports the $8 price target, equivalent to 15 times the firm's estimated EBITDA for fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn other recent news, Accolade Inc. reported an 18% year-over-year revenue growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, totaling $110.5 million. However, the company revised its full-year revenue outlook for 2025 to between $460 million and $475 million, indicating a growth of 11% to 15%. Analyst firms Canaccord Genuity, Needham, Truist Securities, and DA Davidson have all adjusted their price targets for Accolade, while maintaining positive ratings, following the company's revised earnings guidance.\n\nAccolade's management has strategically decided to lower usage-based revenue projections to prioritize profitability, which has influenced its revised revenue forecast. Despite this, the company's EBITDA outlook for FY25 remains positive, ranging from $15 million to $20 million.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nAs Accolade Inc. navigates through its revised revenue guidance and aims for profitability, real-time data from InvestingPro provides a deeper insight into the company's financial health. With a market capitalization of $511.25 million, the company is positioned in a challenging market environment. The P/E ratio stands at -5.46, reflecting investor concerns about near-term earnings potential and aligning with analysts' expectations that the company will not be profitable this year. Additionally, the revenue growth of 14.09% for the last twelve months as of Q4 2024 indicates that while the company is growing, it has had to temper its expectations in line with its latest guidance.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight the high shareholder yield and the fact that the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, suggesting a degree of financial stability. However, stock price volatility and a significant decline over the last three to six months mirror the market's reaction to the recent developments and guidance updates from Accolade.

        "body": "On Friday, Craig-Hallum adjusted its outlook for Kura Sushi USA Inc . (NASDAQ: ), reducing the price target to $120 from $130, while still recommending the stock as a Buy. The adjustment came after Kura Sushi reported preliminary financial results for the third fiscal quarter that fell short of expectations, primarily due to unexpected sales weakness in the California market. This downturn followed the implementation of the state's FAST Act.\n\nKura Sushi's revised forecast for fiscal year 2024 now sets the midpoint of sales guidance $8.5 million lower, indicating the company's belief that the softer sales trend continued into June. Despite the collaboration with Dragon Ball (NYSE: ) that started in May, the initiative did not generate sufficient excitement to offset the effects of higher industry prices squeezing California consumers.\n\nEven with these challenges, Kura Sushi anticipates nearly 20% restaurant-level margins for the third fiscal quarter, which positions it highly within the casual dining industry. Additionally, the company successfully opened four new locations in the third fiscal quarter, reaching the low end of its full-year 2024 guidance, and plans to inaugurate another establishment next week.\n\nCraig-Hallum remains positive about Kura Sushi's long-term prospects, citing the company's robust pace of new openings as a key component of its growth strategy. The firm anticipates that Kura Sushi's scalable concept will drive an eightfold to tenfold increase in unit growth, securing its place as a leading growth story in the restaurant sector over the next decade. Despite the current slowdown, the outlook for the rest of the 2024 calendar year is expected to improve as the company continues to expand its footprint.\n\nIn other recent news, Kura Sushi USA Inc. has reported solid financial performance for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, with total sales reaching $57.3 million and comparable sales growth of 3%. Despite an operating loss and a net loss for the quarter, the company maintains a healthy cash position with no debt and plans to open 13 to 14 new restaurants by the end of the fiscal year. In light of these developments, Citi has adjusted its outlook on the company, reducing its price target to $79 from $101, yet maintaining a Neutral rating. This revision follows a modest same-store sales growth of 0.6% in the third fiscal quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nInvestment firm Piper Sandler initiated coverage on Kura Sushi with a Neutral rating and a price target of $114, citing the company's unique use of technology in enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency. Despite these strengths, the firm noted that the company's stock price already carries a significant premium compared to its industry peers.\n\nIn other developments, Kura Sushi has been experiencing ongoing challenges, particularly in California, where approximately one-third of its stores are located. The state has been identified as the main contributor to the company's weaker than expected comparable sales.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nKura Sushi USA Inc. (NASDAQ:KRUS) is navigating through challenges, as reflected in their recent preliminary financial results. Despite this, the company is showing signs of resilience and potential for growth. According to InvestingPro data, Kura Sushi has a market capitalization of $925.3 million and is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 576.06. This is a premium valuation that investors are willing to pay for the company's earnings, suggesting that the market has high expectations for its future growth.\n\nNotably, the company has experienced a robust revenue growth of over 30% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which is a positive indicator of its expansion capabilities. Additionally, Kura Sushi has been profitable over the last twelve months, with an EBITDA growth of 53.0%.

        "body": "On Friday, Jefferies maintained a positive outlook on Sony Corp (TYO: ). (6785:JP) (NYSE: SONY), raising its price target from JPY19,250.00 to JPY19,450.00 while keeping a Buy rating on the stock. The firm's optimism stems from recent discussions with Sony (NYSE: ) executives, which bolstered confidence in the earnings trajectory for the company's Games and Music divisions.\n\nThe analyst from Jefferies highlighted that contrary to the belief held by some newer investors that Sony's Game business is in decline, the reality is quite the opposite. The growth prospects for the gaming division are strong, supported by software growth, subscription revenue growth, and potential margin expansion. This outlook challenges the guidance suggesting a decline in PlayStation 5 hardware sales.\n\nIn the music sector, the firm anticipates Sony will benefit from Spotify (NYSE: )'s price increase. This potential uplift in revenue contributed to the decision to adjust Sony's estimates and price target upward.\n\nThe analyst's remarks underscore a positive future for Sony's gaming business, emphasizing that the current narrative of decline does not align with the company's actual performance and potential. Additionally, the music division is expected to see a positive impact from external pricing strategies in the industry, such as those by Spotify.\n\nJefferies' revised price target reflects a modest increase but signifies continued confidence in Sony's ability to grow its earnings across key entertainment sectors. The firm's analysis suggests that Sony is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths in the gaming and music markets.\n\nIn other recent news, Sony Group Corporation has experienced significant developments. The company reported a record fiscal year in 2023, with consolidated sales reaching JPY 13,020.8 billion, operating income hitting JPY 1,208.8 billion, and a net income of JPY 970.6 billion. Despite a decrease in PlayStation 5 sales, Sony has seen success with its live service game \"Helldivers 2,\" which has sold over 12 million units since its release.\n\nSony has also been the focus of legal proceedings, with major music corporations Sony Music, Universal Music Group (AS: ), and Warner Records filing lawsuits against artificial intelligence firms Suno and Udio over allegations of mass copyright infringement. The outcome of these cases could have implications for the use of copyrighted material in training AI systems.\n\nAnalysts have maintained a positive outlook on Sony, with Jefferies reiterating a Buy rating and Oppenheimer maintaining an Outperform rating. These affirmations reflect confidence in Sony's strategic initiatives and financial performance. Sony's management has emphasized strategies to enhance profitability, including leveraging synergies across its diverse portfolio of businesses and adopting a cautious approach to mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "title": "Nike stock target raised, hold rating sustained By Investing.com",
        "body": "On Friday, CFRA made adjustments to its outlook on Nike Inc (NYSE: ), raising the sportswear giant's price target from $83.00 to $89.00, while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. The revised price target is set at 25.5 times CFRA's fiscal year 2025 (ending in May) earnings per share (EPS) estimate, which is a decrease from the company's two-year average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.9x.\n\nThe firm has adjusted its EPS estimate for fiscal year 2025 down by $0.25 to $3.50 and has introduced an EPS estimate of $3.75 for fiscal year 2026. Nike recently reported normalized earnings for the fourth quarter at $1.01 per share, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.17. However, the company's revenue for the quarter was $12.6 billion, slightly below the expected $12.8 billion.\n\nNike's performance in the fourth quarter varied by region, with North America seeing a 1% year-over-year decline, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) experiencing a 2% decrease, while China's sales grew by 3%, and the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions each saw a 1% increase. The company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues fell by 8%, whereas wholesale revenues rose by 5%. Additionally, Nike's fourth-quarter gross margin improved by 110 basis points year-over-year to 44.7%, attributed to lower freight costs and pricing increases.\n\nCFRA's stance on Nike reflects confidence in the company's robust balance sheet, consistent capital returns, and the enduring appeal of its global brand to consumers. Despite these strengths, the firm advises caution due to the heightened competitive landscape in the industry.\n\nIn other recent news, Nike has been the subject of several adjustments by analyst firms, following its latest earnings report and updated financial forecast for fiscal 2025. The company's earnings per share of $1.01 exceeded expectations, however, the year-over-year revenue experienced a decline of 1.7%, falling short of the anticipated 0.5% increase. BMO Capital, TD Cowen, Williams Trading, JPMorgan, and Evercore ISI have all adjusted their price targets for Nike, with varying ratings.\n\nThe new guidance provided by Nike suggests a decrease in revenue for the first quarter, first half, and full year of fiscal 2025. However, Nike anticipates a rebound in its Lifestyle categories during the second half of the fiscal year. These recent developments have also impacted other players in the athletic apparel and footwear market, such as JD (NASDAQ: ) Sports, Puma, and Adidas (OTC: ).\n\nAnalysts from Kepler Cheuvreux suggest that Nike's adjusted business strategy could present Adidas with an opportunity to expand its market share. Despite the challenges, Nike maintains its focus on innovation and strategic initiatives for future growth.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nIn light of the recent CFRA report on Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), a deeper dive into the company's financial health and market performance using InvestingPro's real-time data and tips offers additional insights for investors. The current market capitalization of Nike stands at $117.78 billion, with a Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.25, reflecting investor sentiment and the company's earnings capacity. Notably, Nike's strong historical commitment to shareholder returns is highlighted by its impressive track record of raising dividends for 22 consecutive years, a testament to its financial stability and consistent performance.\n\nInvestingPro data shows a modest revenue growth in the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, at 1.89%, with a gross profit margin of 44.3%, aligning closely with the improved gross margin reported in the recent quarter. These figures underscore the company's ability to maintain profitability and manage costs effectively. Additionally, Nike's strategy appears to be paying off as it trades with low price volatility, offering a degree of stability in a fluctuating market.\n\nFor investors seeking further in-depth analysis and additional metrics, InvestingPro provides a comprehensive list of tips that can be accessed at https://www.investing.com/pro/NKE.

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump is the clear favorite when it comes to the stock market, according to the latest results of CNBC's Delivering Alpha Stock Survey.\n\nOf the 400 investors, traders and money managers polled, 67% said Trump would be better for stocks than President Joe Biden. The S&P 500 rose 68% during Trump's four years in office versus the 44% gain so far under Biden's administration. The Nasdaq jumped 137% during Trump's administration, compared with a 34% gain for Biden three and a half years into his four-year term.\n\nThe performance of the Federal Reserve is likely to be a big issue this election season as well as the debate over inflation, and what to do about it.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of the survey respondents said they trusted the central bank to do right by the American economy, but 23% said they didn't trust the Fed. Two-thirds said they believe the Fed will cut interest rates before the end of this year, but 23% disagreed, saying there'll be no cut in 2024. Ten percent of respondents said they would urge the Fed to cut at the next meeting on July 30-31.\n\nThe 400 money managers who took the survey were evenly split on where they stand on the direction of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. A third expect we'll have a 5% or more drop by autumn. A third said the markets will be up 5% or more by then. And another third said we're likely to remain range-bound. Both indexes are trading at record high levels, with the S&P 500 up more than 15% since the start of the year, while the Nasdaq has climbed nearly 20%.\n\nA vast majority, some 80%, said they were uncomfortable with how tech heavy the major indexes have become to the point where it makes them nervous.\n\nA big part of those jitters come from Nvidia's rise. The stock is up more than 150% in 2024, but down about 12% from its 52-week high as of Thursday's close. The drop was logged all in the last week.",

        "body": "Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a \u201ccostly mistake\u201d by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election.\n\nThe Indian owner of the vast south Wales steelworks said on Thursday that it intended to cease operations at two blast furnaces on the site by 7 July \u2013 three days after the general election \u2013 in response to strike action announced by Unite members from 8 July. The company had planned to shut one furnace by the end of June and a second by September.\n\nAbout 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata\u2019s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.\n\nThe company said: \u201cWe cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action.\u201d\n\nA Tata Steel spokesperson called on Unite to cancel the industrial action and said it had began legal action to \u201cchallenge the validity of Unite\u2019s ballot\u201d. Tata called on Unite to consider \u201cthe company\u2019s proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training, and skills development\u201d.\n\nThe decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday\u2019s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, have pledged up to \u00a33bn to support the industry\u2019s transition to low carbon steel production, which is expected to include honouring an existing \u00a3500m package of government support for Port Talbot. A new electric arc furnace will be built by the end of 2027.\n\nTorsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank who is standing as Labour candidate for Swansea West, said on X that Tata\u2019s decision was \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cSafety is of course paramount but Tata should avoid taking any action that cannot be reversed before seeing the result of the general election.\n\n\u201cWe need to see everyone getting round the table. It is crucial we don\u2019t lose the chance for the company and unions to sit down with an incoming Labour government, given the commitment from [Reynolds] and [Reeves] to a \u00a32.5bn steel renewal fund.\u201d\n\nOnay Kasab, Unite\u2019s national lead officer, said the union had asked for a meeting to discuss how to operate the site safely during the industrial action \u2013 the first steel strikes in 40 years \u2013 since it was called last week. He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.\n\nKasab said: \u201cTo issue that statement last night knowing full well the meeting was today \u2013 it\u2019s about trying to create fear and uncertainty among the workforce. Safety is paramount. Our argument is that the blast furnace does not have to be turned off before the electric arc furnace comes on, so of course we are not going to take action which means it is turned off.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the decision-makers in Mumbai to get involved in the discussions and we want Labour to stick to their commitment.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reynolds needs to sit down with the company to see to quickly put things in place.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, when launching Labour\u2019s election campaign in Wales last month, said he would \u201cfight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales\u201d.\n\nVaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: \u201cWe will not support the closure of both furnaces. This will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. He added: \u201cUrgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: \u201cTata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out.\n\n\u201cA better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake.\n\n\u201cIt will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK.\u201d",
        "summary": "Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a \u201ccostly mistake\u201d by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election.\nAbout 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata\u2019s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.\nThe decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday\u2019s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.\nHe said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.\nVaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: \u201cWe will not support the closure of both furnaces.",

        "title": "Zscaler Vs. Crowdstrike: Which Of These Two Great Companies To Buy Now (NASDAQ:ZS)",
        "body": "Michael Vi\n\nInvesting in Cybersecurity can be hard-Valuation is still important\n\nThese days, or so it seems, the question in tech investing is more about investing in AI and whether or not to focus investments on hardware, and specifically Nvidia (NVDA) and a few analog companies or to try to choose a balanced portfolio of high growth names. I am not going to specifically address that question in this article, although I recognize that is what many investors are most interested in. I will simply observe that while software companies at this point can\u2019t rival the growth and profitability of Nvidia, in the long term the demand for GPUs, while likely to show outsize growth for the next several quarters, is inevitably a precursor for demand for software to run on those GPUs, assembled into servers as the foundation for AI apps. I read, recently, that while something in excess of $50 billion of GPUs that are being used in AI servers have been sold, AI software revenue has been around $3 billion. Indeed some of that GPU demand is coming from software companies who are expanding their own networks rapidly to deal with anticipated demand for capacity necessary to support generative AI applications.\n\nGenerative AI applications, as they are deployed, will have to be protected, and the data used for the large language models that are crucial to run generative AI apps has to be secured. Although at this point, the demand tailwind from that trend is not really in evidence, it is likely to be a powerful tailwind for cybersecurity demand from enterprises and organizations almost universally. While both Crowdstrike (CRWD) and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) have their own generative AI applications to enhance the performance of their cybersecurity solutions and to automate internal processes, those revenues are not going to be substantial in the next year or so, at least in my opinion.\n\nThis is an article trying to focus on the question of which of these cyber security leaders is the better investment. These companies are not competitors, and almost certainly will not be in the foreseeable future. Indeed, they are partners and will co-sell deals, mainly on a tactical basis. Both Crowdstrike and Zscaler are excellent companies in terms of their competitive positioning, their business model and their execution capability-although some observers are a bit concerned about ZS on the later score and they both are dominant in their component of the cyber-security world.\n\nBoth companies have enjoyed prodigious growth, and I believe that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. But these days, I find the investment merits of Zscaler far outweigh those of Crowdstrike and after many years as a shareholder, my portfolio is currently void of CRWD shares. Indeed, in looking at valuation as a function of both growth and free cash flow margins, I believe that ZS shares to be amongst the top choices in my investment universe. This is an article comparing and contrasting the business and investment attributes of both Zscaler and Crowdstrike over the next 12 months and beyond. I recommend the purchase of ZS shares at this time and at this price.\n\nI typically don\u2019t try to grade stocks or establish price targets. Were I to do so, I would rate shares of Crowdstrike as a hold.\n\nZscaler-Why has its valuation contracted so massively?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this company Zscaler is the leader in supplying what are called zero trust edge solutions to enable cybersecurity in the cloud. Many industry writers and participants talk about SASE, which stands for Secure Access Service Edge. SASE is a concept popularized by Gartner who has developed its Magic Quadrant ratings around its definition of SASE. SASE is technology used to deliver security controls as a cloud service directly to the source of connection-the SASE model can be based on users, devices or edge computing locations rather than firewalls that try to secure data centers. As more workloads move to the cloud, SASE has seen exponential growth. The concept of SASE-and of zero trust architecture-is to secure access through dispersed points of presence located as close as possible to dispersed users, branch offices and cloud locations.\n\nSASE has an estimated CAGR of 29% for the next several years; it has been growing at rates in the mid-high 20% range for some years. Zscaler has long been rated in the leader\u2019s quadrant in this area by both Gartner and Forrester. Its growth vectors include leadership as a SASE vendor coupled with growth stemming from product introductions into adjacencies and most lately a unified platform that enabled the company to sell through vendor consolidation. If the platform approach strategy sounds familiar it is because it is. For a vendor of the scale of ZS to be successful in the current environment in which cyber-security solutions are sold to be successful basically requires a robust platform strategy that is enabled by a go-to-market strategy that leans heavily on consolidating vendors by offering a holistic approach.\n\nOnce upon a time-and really not so long ago as all of that shares of Zscaler and Crowdstrike had similar valuations. And for some time going back several years, Zscaler shares had a lofty absolute and relative valuation. Perhaps surprisingly, those days have passed.\n\nOne issue of the recent past has been guidance-and particularly guidance for calculated bookings. Zscaler\u2019s CFO has focused investors on the calculated billings metric for some years. That is consistent with some other cyber security companies such as Palo Alto (PANW). Recently, some companies have chosen to deemphasize the calculated billings metric as not being particularly helpful in evaluating the sales activity of a particular company.\n\nThe problem is that at some level, calculated billings is exceptionally difficult to forecast and while a key component in free cash flow changes, the metric has less to do as a representation of business trends then many investors might appreciate. Over the years, investors have reacted strongly to the release of calculated billings data for Zscaler, and its forecast with impatience and concern.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the construction of calculated billings, it consists of actual revenues for a given period in addition to the net change in the deferred revenue balance. And therein lies the problem. Deferred revenue changes are driven by deals in which the customer prepays for a certain time period. So, contract duration and the propensity of users to prepay as well as the total value of signed contracts drives the calculated billings metric. Software vendors, and that includes Zscaler, have little or no control when it comes to contract duration and have even less control about whether or not customers prepay. So, while calculated billings can be highly variable, and the ability of Zscaler to forecast this metric is limited, the core business is little impacted by either contract duration or the propensity of users to prepay.\n\nZscaler no longer provides explicit quarterly forecasts for billings. It does forecast the annual growth in billings, which is a focus metric of some. Calculated billings growth was 30% last quarter, an increase from the prior quarter because of a stronger than anticipated growth in deferred revenues. The company increased its forecast for calculated billings from $2.56 billion to $2.61 billion. The shares, after having fallen by as much as 38% since mid-February, rose by 8% that day, and have drifted modestly higher since that point. In the prior quarter, the company had only increased its calculated billings forecast from $2.54 billion to $2.56 billion. That relatively small raise in the forecast for calculated billings drove the shares down by 9% on the day after the earnings release, and they drifted lower from that point, with the lower drift accelerated after Palo Alto announced its platformization strategy.\n\nOver that span, the company has increased its revenue forecast from $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion, and increased its EPS forecast from $2.48 to $3.00. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin has risen to 22%, compared to 19% in the prior year. Just like some other high growth companies such as Oracle (ORCL), the company\u2019s free cash flow margin growth is being constrained because of substantial capex necessary to provide SASE capacity through the construction of data centers. Again, over the same span, the company\u2019s backlog has grown from about $3.49 billion to $3.82 billion. While RPO is a better number to use when forecasting short-term revenues, it has its problems as well as it is significantly influenced by contract duration.\n\nPrior to the earnings release, the analysts at two brokerages, Wells Fargo and Rosenblatt had downgraded the shares because of their fears that the calculated billings metrics would be disappointing. Thus far they (the analysts) haven\u2019t reacted by changing their ratings now that calculated billings metrics showed an acceleration. One analyst, Brian Essex of JP Morgan has raised his rating of the shares to Strong Buy from Hold with a $230 price target. The upgrade hasn\u2019t had much influence on the share price which has fallen marginally the last few days as part of the divergence trade between megacaps and smaller, high growth IT vendors.\n\nThe other issue cited by some analysts including those at Morgan Stanley relates to sales force turnover. Late last year, Zscaler appointed a new Chief Revenue Officer, Mike Rich, and a new Chief Marketing officer, Joyce Kim. Mr. Rich came to Zscaler from ServiceNow (NOW) and had been at that company in the period in which that company\u2019s sales grew from $80 million to $8.5 billion. Not terribly surprisingly the former head of sales, Dali Rajic left to take a COO position at Wiz, a cloud security startup.\n\nMike Rich was specifically hired by Zscaler to create a sales force more focused on the enterprise and more focused on platform selling. As I have mentioned, platform selling is a crucial factor in the path ZS will have from its current level to its aspirational revenue goal of $5 billion. The company almost certainly needed to induce some turnover, and some individuals who had been recruited by the former COO left to join his new team.\n\nWhat I found encouraging is that despite sales turnover, the company was able to drive revenues and bookings to levels greater than planned. The company is now accelerating sales hiring which will mainly impact revenue growth in FY \u201925. Sales turnover is supposed to stabilize this quarter; that\u2019s mainly a function of the new sales management having made most of the necessary culls already. Usually turnover stability is correlated with a growth in sales productivity and one reason to speculate that sales growth will exceed forecast levels this quarter is just that-a decline in sales turnover.\n\nZscaler\u2019s Platform Strategy-Can the company grow its revenues greater than estimates for the SASE CAGR?\n\nThat is a bit of a softball question. If I didn\u2019t think so, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this article or recommending the shares. But the strong demand signals coming from the space are an excellent starting point in assessing demand growth. As mentioned earlier, the SASE space, basically the core of Zscaler\u2019s business continues to grow in the mid-high 20% range. That ought to be the floor estimate for Zscaler\u2019s growth.\n\nOverall, the cybersecurity space is complex and more replete with jargon terminology than even other areas of IT. Zscaler describes its offering as based on 4 pillars. These include Cyberthreat protection, Data Protection, Zero Trust Connectivity, and Business analytics. These pillars are supported by multiple products. Key Zscaler products include ZIA, the company\u2019s initial product which secures internet access, ZPA, the company\u2019s private access security product, ZDX, a network performance monitoring solution and Data Protection, which as the name implies, is designed to protect data of all types and in all locations from the end-point to the cloud.\n\nI am not going to try to evaluate each of these 4 offerings in detail-I am not qualified to do so and readers won\u2019t get value-add in learning the different feature/functions of all of the products in all of the offerings. There are lots of claims out there in this business and making sense of them is a full time job-done by literally thousands of analysts at a variety of consultancies ranging from Gartner and Forrester to G2 and many, many others.\n\nThe factor that is most important today is platformization, or put another way, vendor consolidation. The reason Zscaler changed its CRO and has seen elevated sales force turnover is very straightforward. They-and I for that matter-believe that the only way to maintain hyper growth is by selling large enterprise users a multi-product platform. To do so requires different selling skills than selling a point solution. That is why the hiring of Mike Rich was strategic and not an indication of some issue with the ease of selling ZS products.\n\nZscaler\u2019s platform is the Zero Trust Exchange Platform. I have provided a link for those interested in a more thorough description. The platform encompasses all phases of cybersecurity from identity management provided by a 3rd party integration with Okta (OKTA), through SaaS, Internet, Cloud and Data Center.\n\nThere are many competitive point solution in each of the last 4 areas cited above. Many of them really cover less than all of cyber-security issues in just one area. Zscaler, unlike Palo Alto, is not trying to offer what the CEO of this company called a \u201cGod Security Platform.\u201d Zscaler is consolidating products from legacy firewall providers, VPN\u2019s and other cybersecurity vendors. Not terribly surprisingly, the result for users can be quite a bit cheaper overall, even though most of Zscaler\u2019s sales motion remains one of value selling.-The overall end-result of consolidating multiple products can be cheaper in terms of procurement, but cheaper still in terms of management and orchestration efforts.\n\nOne thing Zscaler has provided customers for some time is a means to justify its platform by an ROI analysis that highlights savings. This is not the same thing as the ELA bundles that Palo Alto announced a couple of months ago to great fanfare, and to some trepidation on the part of investors and analysts. The Zscaler consolidation approach-at least to me-is a far more focused and user friendly approach to consolidation than what Palo Alto has been trying to sell.\n\nOver time, Zscaler\u2019s growth in what I call adjacencies that are part of its platform is a principle reason I believe that the company can grow faster than the market for SASE. Zscaler has seen substantial growth in what they call the workload market. Another substantial emerging market for the company is that of protecting IoT networks. One of the company\u2019s latest acquisitions that of Airgap, was basically done to extend ZS\u2019s capability in that space.\n\nZscaler Data Protection is another significant adjacency. There are many competitors in the space, with some solutions available from larger companies such as Cloudflare (NET) and Fortinet (FTNT), but most coming from smaller vendors such as Forcepoint and Proofpoint. These are the vendors most vulnerable to displacement from Zscaler\u2019s Exchange Platform and many of the large deals called out by the CEO on related to that kind of activity which led to growth exceeding expectations.\n\nZscaler offers a kind of observability that it calls Digital Experience. It is a different way of doing observability and builds off Zscaler\u2019s platform. ZDX as it is called, proactively monitors every device, every user and every application. It is not intended to be a direct competitor of other observability vendors such as Dynatrace (DT) and Datadog (DDOG). It is not intended to solve the pain points that observability vendors try to ameliorate.\n\nBoth ZDX and Zscaler Data Protection have been projected by the company to move the needle in the coming fiscal year. The CEO called out Airgap as a potential significant growth driver, but that company had less than $2 million in revenues last year so it is unlikely to have a noticeable financial impact in the near future.\n\nThe company believes that in terms of dollar growth, its ZPA product, which has been a growth driver for years, will be the largest single growth driver in the next couple of years. The company, taking a page from the Crowdstrike's Falcon playbook, has initiated a service that is focused on establishing strong relationships with global system integrators. Many of these GSIs, at least according to several brokerage analysts, apparently are big fans of the company\u2019s new CRO, and there will be deals that come together because of partnerships with GSIs and their relationship with the new CRO. I think it is the combination of all of these factors that support my belief that Zscaler revenue growth can exceed current expectations.\n\nZscaler\u2019s competitive positioning and advantages\n\nThere are many competitors for Zscaler. That said, it has been a pioneer in the development of a purpose built platform designed to secure network data emanating from the cloud. I have linked here to a listing of Zscaler\u2019s competitors. One investor concern, often expressed, is that somehow Zscaler is losing its competitive edge because of the entrance of many competitors into the space. To a certain extent the exact opposite seems to be true. Zscaler is winning deals by displacing smaller competitors as users try to consolidate vendors and rely on platform vendors for their cybersecurity requirements. I have linked to Gartner\u2019s Peer Insights survey.\n\nWhile both Cisco (CSCO) and Microsoft (MSFT) are seen as competitors, they tend to mainly be deployed in situations where the user has either a predominately Cisco or Microsoft environment. I think the most salient Zscaler competitor these days is Palo Alto\u2019s Prisma. I am not going to try to disentangle the various claims and press releases about which one is better. Zscaler has sold its architecture, which was purpose built for the SASE security requirement, since it has been a company. It CEO, Jay Chaudhry, has been an evangelist for Zscaler\u2019s architectural differentiation for years.\n\nPrisma has been sold based on the fact that it is part of an overall Palo Alto solution. Many Palo Alto customers, looking to build a total Palo Alto security solution, have migrated to Prisma. In instances in which competition is not weighted by incumbency, Zscaler has had a high win rate. Recently, the Palo Alto sales engine has sputtered, to a degree. In response, the company has begun to offer users platform bundles. At some level, those bundles might be seen as price cuts. There are specific issues with the platform offers that have prevented their availability from having a significant impact on the ability of Zscaler to win deals. I have linked to one analysis of Prisma vs. Zscaler; there are many others but they really won\u2019t tell you who has a better solution, let alone who is winning the market share battle. Comparisons like this one simply have no ability to incorporate a review of architecture, in fact the principle Zscaler selling point and differentiating factor.\n\nAnother principle competitor of Zscaler has been Cloudflare (NET). Again, there are loads of claims and counterclaims. Cloudflare, of course, is cloud native and has a zero trust architecture. Historically, Zscaler has sold larger enterprises, while Cloudflare has been more focused on relatively smaller customers. That is still basically the case although obviously the management at Cloudflare vigorously asserts its equality with ZS solutions within large enterprises.\n\nThe real differentiation here is basically the breadth and functionality of ZS emerging products which account for about 1/3rd of bookings these days, but also help the company to better sell to large enterprises.\n\nMost recently, there seems to have been an upsurge in breaches affecting the customers of some of the many VPN vendors. Consolidating those vendors, most of whom are private and probably not known by many readers has been noted by analysts and by the CEO as fertile ground for consolidation. This one reason, I believe, why the company has called out its ZPA offering as contributing the most growth dollars currently and over the next year.\n\nEarlier this year, Zscaler introduced what it calls Zero Trust SD-WAN and I have linked that announcement here. This is supposed to be a big deal in the industry and a significant competitive differentiator. It extends the concept of zero trust to devices and server traffic at branches, warehouses and factories. This is a quote from the CEO on the latest conference call and expresses his thoughts about the importance of this launch for Zscaler.\n\nA big area of TAM expansion for us is actually Zero Trust per branch. We think this is where we are hit. We believe it's a matter of time in three, four years. Everyone will say, are you using traditional SD-WAN or are you using Zero Trust SD-WAN? We're the only vendor in the market that offers Zero Trust SD-WAN and Copycats will try to come and follow-up in the next three, four years, then we're going to move to the next level. We will talk about probably in coming quarters. But if you asked me to take a guess, Ashwin and I have been debating a little bit. We think we added somewhere in the $10 billion to $20 billion on top of $72 billion we have talked about before. (Ashwin is the head of Strategic Finance\n\nCloud security is a large and fast growing space. The TAM that Zscaler now addresses has reached greater than $90 billion based on some of the new product areas it has introduced, and based on some of its latest acquisitions. There is never going to be a single winner. I think investor and analyst concerns regarding competition are substantially overdone.\n\nZscaler and AI\n\nZscaler is using AI to power several of its products. That, in itself, is probably not adding a huge amount of growth to its revenue base, at least this year. AI provides ZS users greater functionality and automates the management of some security functions. Currently the company offers segmentation, phishing detection, command and control detection, data protection, sandboxing and maturity assessments based on the use of AI technology. The company recently bought Avalor which enhances security insights by the use of AI. Basically. Avalor has pre-built integrations that customers can use to proactively identify and predict vulnerabilities. ZI is enhancing this technology through the use of its massive data foundation which is part of its core business. The company was apparently bought for $300 million and had ARR of $3 million. The concept is that adding Avalor to its stack will enable the ZS to enhance the sales opportunities for its own data exchange.\n\nLast month the company announced some significant AI innovations to the company\u2019s data protection platform. It has also recently introduced a co-pilot solution for its experience monitoring solution. Of all the AI functionality the company has introduced, the one I think that will be a significant demand driver is what the company call GenAI apps.\n\nAI is an important tool in enhancing Zscaler\u2019s security offerings. But in terms of revenue, my guess is that the significant revenue tailwind will come as users actually deploy applications built on generative AI technology. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, and realistically it isn\u2019t likely to be a significant factor in revenue growth for ZS until 2025. The forecasts the company has provided for the current fiscal year really aren\u2019t based from that kind of contribution. Zscaler\u2019s AI Data Protection Platform whose description I have linked here will probably be the product area that sees much of tailwind as AI apps are actually deployed.\n\nRisks to the Zscaler Investment thesis\n\nThe biggest risk to the Zscaler investment thesis is probably that of sales execution. While all the signs of the sales leadership transition have been positive, and while last quarter saw a significant beat on revenues and bookings despite elevated sales force turnover, the advent of a new sales leader, even with the credentials of Mike Rich, the new CRO, is never without an element of risk as new roles are filled and there is some level of turnover. Guidance apparently was based on some extra conservatism to account for this risk.\n\nThe other major risk here is that of competition. Zscaler competes with a multitude of competitors. Some are basically trying to adapt their legacy platforms to deal with a world in which zero trust is a requirement. Others are point solutions which may or may not be best of breed. So far, as best as I can tell, Zscaler has continued to gain share and continued to innovate at a rate such that its differentiation is growing. I believe it has substantial market share opportunities as more enterprise users choose to switch more components of their cyber protection strategy to a zero trust paradigm.\n\nFinally, the dimensions of the inevitable tailwind from the deployment of generative AI applications is not really known at this point. Substantial-almost certainly-but how substantial and the exact cadence, not really knowable at this point. I really think that actual, quantifiable expectations for this tailwind are significant, but my thesis is that by next year protecting AI data will become a demand driver, and of course this is a risk as it hasn\u2019t yet happened.\n\nZscaler\u2019s business model and its guidance\n\nSometimes in looking at the steady selling seen in Zscaler shares subsequent to their spike in the wake of better than anticipated earnings and guidance, I have to scratch my head and wonder if the company raised its forecast. Of course, as mentioned the guidance increase was a bit skinny, at least for some. But I think this comment from the CFO ought to be more than a bit telling in that regard.\n\nRemo Canessa -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you for the question. Number one, we like being prudent. So, that's number one. Number two is Q3 was a very, very strong quarter for us. We beat the basically consensus on a top-line basis by 8%. And also, fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we called out that we had a large $20 million deal. So, it's a tough compare from a billing perspective going into -- tough compare for '24 versus '23, and you got the last point, the attrition did play into it also.\n\nI would suggest that large deals happen at various times in a given year. Deal sizes for this company have continued to rise because it has more to sell and shifting to an enterprise focus is going to play a significant role in that. So, I think basically that this was exceptionally prudent guidance designed to be beaten. I don\u2019t think that the 8% beat called out by the CFO above was typical at all, and there were few companies in this space or amongst all IT companies that were able to produce that kind of result.\n\nZscaler has been able to bring its non-GAAP operating margins to a level in the low-mid 20% range, and the company is forecasting modest but steady improvement over the next several quarters. Last quarter, the company was GAAP profitable, mainly because the expense of stock based compensation declined from 26% of revenue to 22% of revenue due to the departure of the company\u2019s former COO and other sales turnover he lost their RSU because of vesting provisions in those awards.\n\nDespite concerns about price competition, Zscaler has been able to raise non-GAAP gross margins to the range of 81%, about a 100 bps improvement from the prior year. Overall, operating margins last quarter reached 22%, compared to 15% in the year earlier period and compared to 20% in the prior sequential quarter. A significant reason for the substantial earnings beat was that operating expenses increased just 2% sequentially.\n\nThe company is projecting sequential revenue growth of about 2.5%. That is almost certainly more \u201cprudent\u201d than realistic. In the past, there has been some positive seasonality for this company in its fiscal Q4. The company is almost certainly going to see operating expense rise by quite a bit more than last quarter\u2019s 2% as it hires more sales capacity and continues to invest substantially in research and development which rose by 33% year on year last quarter.\n\nThe ZS CFO has been reasonably forthright about margins going forward. Sometimes, his specific comments on profitability may seem a bit cavalier, but at this point, margins have increased far faster than had been anticipated recently. Overall, the current projection outlined by the CFO is that operating margins should increase modestly in FY \u201925, which starts 8/1. Currently, published revenue growth expectations for FY\u201925 are at 23%. I wouldn\u2019t be recommending the shares if I believe that revenue growth would slow to that kind of cadence.\n\nWith revenue growth of 23% and a slight increase in operating margins forecast, the published consensus non-GAAP EPS forecast is $3.32. I would be surprised if that number wasn\u2019t exceeded by a significant percentage. It seems possible that with profitability continuing to advance the company will achieve GAAP profitability for the full year of fiscal \u201925.\n\nThe company has been generating free cash flow for some time at this point. In the first 9 months of the year, the company\u2019s operating cashflow rose by more than 75%. CapEx rose by 35% so the free cash flow margin for the first 9 months came to 30% compared to 22% in the year earlier period. In the interest of conservatism, my valuation model projects a free cash flow margin for ZS of 28%.\n\nAs noted, Zscaler does use SBC, although the SBC expense ratio fell noticeably last quarter. That said, I believe that dilution is a far better measure of SBC than reported SBC metrics. That said, because Zscaler has gone from a GAAP loss to a GAAP profit, and the accounting convention requires the recognition of additional option shares once GAAP profitability has been attained, the current dilution metric is not meaningful. As a result of forecasting GAAP profitability, the company\u2019s estimated fully diluted share count has risen to 165 million for the current quarter. I have used a projection of 169 million fully diluted outstanding shares for the next 12 months.\n\nZS shares are an attractive investment just based on their stand-alone metrics in terms of growth and profitability. But they really show up as an exceptional value in comparison with Crowdstrike-an investment alternative in the cybersecurity space. Just to reiterate, I continue to recommend investing ion Zscaler shares at this time and at this price ($179/share).\n\nCrowdstrike-It\u2019s got everything going for it and every one knows it does.\n\nFor many years Crowdstrike has been my largest single holding in the cyber security space. The last time I wrote about the shares for SA was after an unusual guide down nesar the end of 2022. The shares since then have more than tripled. The first time I wrote about it was in the wake of its IPO way back in 2019. Back then it was $58/share, and it was at that price that I made my first purchase. And now for the first time in 5 years, I have no holdings remaining in Crowdstrike shares.\n\nThe issue for me has been one of relative valuation. Crowdstrike shares have appreciated by 55% since the start of the year. There are reasons for that of course, but despite those reasons, the shares have reached a valuation that I find difficult to reconcile with the company\u2019s prospects for growth and profitability.\n\nI am not going to review Crowdstrike\u2019s business in anything like exhaustive detail. Essentially everything that can go right is going right-product strategy, sales execution, market potential, and profitability are all showing exceptional trends. To be specific, ARR, the metric that Crowdstrike uses to track its go-to-market performance rose by 33% last quarter, and the second order derivative of net new ARR grew by 22%. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin reached 35%. This was a quarter in which the company\u2019s competitive offering displacing Splunk continued to resonate with users. It trifled with its principle competitor, Microsoft, by announcing a product called Falcon for Defender which fills in the gaps of Microsoft\u2019s offerings.\n\nIn the wake of the earnings release and the company\u2019s updated guidance essentially all of the covering analysts increased their published forecasts for both revenues and EPS. And, as well, almost every analyst and investor with a stake in these shares is well aware that the guidance on which their estimates are based has a high probability of being exceeded-last quarter revenues were 2% greater than forecast, while non-GAAP EPS was 4% above the prior forecast. The full year revenue forecast has grown by 1%.\n\nCrowdstrike shares rose by 10% in the day after the earnings release and then rose another 10% when it was announced that the shares would be included in the S&P 500 index. What investors are paying for-and they are paying dearly- is consistency. The quarters that are reported are unambiguous and the guided metrics are consistently above expectations and guidance is consistently increased. And that 2nd order derivative metric of 22% growth in the level of net new ARR suggests that future quarters will continue that record as well as the comment about a comment in this most recent conference call about a record Q2 pipeline. .\n\nWhy has this company achieved the success it has and can it continue?\n\nIn a single word, and one I have used in the past trying to explain the success of this company and other IT vendors it is Platform. Crowdstrike started out as a company built to replace legacy end-point technologies such as those being offered at that time by Symantec and MacAfee. That was extremely successful; Crowdstrike simply offers better protection for endpoints than what had heretofore been available. But of course the endpoint space is rather finite and not growing fast. And so Crowdstrike expanded into adjacencies and then into \u201cnot so adjacencies.\u201d Crowdstrike these days offers 22 modules, and indeed the company calls out the penetration of multiple modules into its customer base as a significant indicia of its success. As of last quarter, 65% of Crowdstrike users were using 5 modules, while 28% were using 7 or more modules. The company has had a platformization strategy before Palo Alto made a virtue of necessity and started offering its own version of platformization. In the case of Crowdstrike, specifically, last quarter there was a 95% increase in deals in which users purchased 8 or more modules.\n\nProbably the most successful of the modules that have been factors in the company\u2019s growth are the offerings that collectively are described as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) a technology pioneered by Splunk, but which has now become a major growth driver as Crowdstrike is taking significant share in this area.\n\nAnother significant adjacency for Crowdstrike has been its offerings in the identity management space. Identity management can mean different things to different groups, and what Crowdstrike calls identity management is quite a bit different when compared to similarly named, but different solutions offered by Okta (OKTA) and CyberArk (CYBR). Crowdstrike and Okta are really complementary and are often sold together. Basically, in these cases, Crowdstrike technology is used to protect the endpoint, and Okta is used to protect the identity of the end-point user who has appropriate permissioning. Overall, Crowdstrike\u2019s deal count in which identity, SIEM and core end-point security are involved together doubled last quarter, and these are some of the largest deals that Crowdstrike has ever sold.\n\nCustomers consolidate their cyber-security vendors for many reasons. At the end of the day, these relate to cost and efficiency. It is simply far less expensive for users to deal with fewer vendors offering multiple products on a single platform. This is no different for Crowdstrike than it is for Zscaler. It is different when compared to the platformization strategy of Palo Alto in which that company is attempting to sell its users additional modules that are not part of an integrated solution and which they are unlikely use.\n\nIn the case of SIEM, the Crowdstrike technology simply is more effective in terms of what SIEM is supposed to do, i.e. ingesting data so it can be analyzed, classified with anomalies detected and notified. Crowdstrike does that better than Splunk and hence its market share gains in addition to the user desire for vendor consolidation.\n\nCrowdstrike has made the buying process more flexible for its users by eliminating introducing Falcon Flex. This is a shot across the bow of Palo Alto. The Flex model has been available for 3 quarters at this point, it has generated $500 million in deal value.\n\nAt this point, I am not going to try to discuss Charlotte AI, Crowdstrike\u2019s AI offering in any detail. Charlotte AI offers the benefits of conversational interactions to improve the productivity of employees doing threat hunting and remediating any issues that have been found. Again, this specific product is not likely to move the needle substantially in the next couple of quarters.\n\nSo what\u2019s the investment issue?\n\nIn a word, valuation. Crowdstrike has been beating its forecast consistently, and I expect it will continue to do so. But its latest beats were not huge, although certainly results were better than feared. The company is forecasting revenue growth this current quarter of 31%, and a non-GAAP operating margin of about 22%, the same as in the prior sequential quarter. The company has essentially maintained its operating margin target and its free cash flow margin target for the full year. The company is forecasting that full year operating margins will be about 23% and that the company\u2019s free cash flow margin will be 33%. The company had a free cash flow margin of 35% last quarter.\n\nI expect these numbers to be modestly exceeded; in reviewing valuation below, I have used a revenue growth rate of 33%, which yields a 12 month forward revenue estimate of about $4.4 billion and I have also used a free cash flow margin estimate of 36%, as well as a 3 year CAGR of 34%. That leaves CRWD shares with an EV/s of 21X. That is, by far, the highest EV/S ratio of any company I follow. The two next highest company\u2019s in terms of EV/S are Palantir (PLTR) and the Trade Desk (TTD), followed by MongoDB (MDB) and ServiceNow (NOW). Crowdstrike\u2019s EV/S is now more than twice that of Zscaler.\n\nMy core valuation framework includes the free cash flow margin, EV/S ratio and an estimate for a 3 year CAGR. On that basis, Crowdstrike\u2019s valuation is basically off the chart-literally because the chart simply wasn\u2019t set up to handle relative valuation of Crowdstrike's magnitude. Companies with relative valuation in the stratosphere, but not at the level of Crowdstrike included Samsara (IOT), Cloudflare (NET), as well as Trade Desk, MongoDB and Palantir. I try not to be myopic and mechanical in the valuation process. Crowdstrike\u2019s consistency, visibility and market leadership obviously are factors in valuation and those factors really can\u2019t be placed into a chart. At some level, at least currently, investors trust Crowdstrike to achieve consistent, high level results and have been willing to accord the shares exceptional valuation because of this confidence.\n\nStocks can be overvalued for an extended period. I have seen it many times and it isn\u2019t always easy to explain on some quantitative basis. And Crowdstrike, at least in my opinion, will grow into its valuation. But over the years, and with notable exceptions, I have found that recommending the highest relative valued equity does not produce significant positive alpha.\n\nRelative Valuation: Why I think Zscaler is a better pick in the cybersecurity space as an investment?\n\nIt is said that one picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think a chart depicts the relative investment merits of ZS and CRWD in an easy to see comparison. My recommendation is not based because I think that CRWD has a cloudy future; indeed I think the opposite is the case. It is solely based on relative valuation.\n\nCrowdstrike vs. Zscaler Relative Valuation\n\nCAGR Current Rev. 3 yr CAGR Ent. Value EV/S Free cash flow\n\nZscaler $2.86 bil. 31% $29.4 bil. 10.2X 28%\n\nCrowdstrike $4.40 bil 34% $93.5 bil. 21.3X 36%\n\nA couple of points to note here: The revenue estimates that I am using are based on the next 4 quarters, and not on the current fiscal year. And since that includes one quarter not forecast, I use a trend analysis to estimate the results for the last quarter. In both cases, I use a free cash flow estimate greater than currently provided by the company-that is mainly based on a fairly consistent track record of exceeding free cash flow estimates over many quarter.\n\nOf course, a key assumption is CAGR. The CAGR estimate I am using is for the next 3 years. I have given a modest advantage here to Crowdstrike. It has been most recently growing slightly faster than Zscaler. My guess is really that growth rates will converge, rather than diverge over time. The core market in which Zscaler is the leader, SASE, is far faster growing than end-point security, the core market of Crowdstrike. It is easier to grow faster when the tide is rising.\n\nThere are some readers who perhaps believe that Zscaler has more competitive threats than Crowdstrike. I personally don\u2019t believe that to be the case; I think both companies have been technology leaders and remain so, and both companies have architectural advantage and that, too, remains the case. I didn\u2019t go through all of the many, many point and platform alternatives to Crowdstrike but the cyber-security space has always had numerous alternative. While vendor consolidation is real, that still leaves room for \u201cankle biter\u201d and what I might term legacy companies such as Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t think it is realistic to try to suggest that one company or the other has a \u201cbetter\u201d set of AI tools. The tools themselves aren\u2019t going to produce a huge amount of revenue over the next couple of quarters; beyond that the AI revolution is going to create more endpoints, more identities, and more data and more cloud applications to protect-that is going to be the most salient of the many growth drivers that AI will mean to these companies.\n\nI believe that Zscaler has more attractive investment parameters at this point than Crowdstrike. And it has an outlook that is not really reflected in its current valuation. To reiterate: I recommend that growth oriented investors acquire or increase positions in Zscaler shares at this price and at this time.",
        "summary": "For those unfamiliar with this company Zscaler is the leader in supplying what are called zero trust edge solutions to enable cybersecurity in the cloud.\nAnd for some time going back several years, Zscaler shares had a lofty absolute and relative valuation.\nI think it is the combination of all of these factors that support my belief that Zscaler revenue growth can exceed current expectations.\nJust to reiterate, I continue to recommend investing ion Zscaler shares at this time and at this price ($179/share).\nAnd now for the first time in 5 years, I have no holdings remaining in Crowdstrike shares.",

        "title": "Amazon: From OPEX To CAPEX- Transform Your Business With Generative AI (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "body": "FinkAvenue\n\nTrends are changing\n\nWith the recent AI boom sparked by demand for NVIDIA (NVDA) chips, the expensing of many of the MAG 7 is about to have an about-face. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google (GOOGL)(GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) have historically taken immediate expensing on the income statement in the form of SG&A and R&D. The aforementioned usually results in lower GAAP income but higher cash flows, as SaaS companies tend to have lower CAPEX needs versus industrial companies that rely on manufacturing facilities to produce products or other heavy machinery.\n\nNow with the massive demand for AI development, expenses will begin to migrate from the income statement to the cash flow statement as at least some portion of OPEX will naturally flow to CAPEX when these companies build more data centers and buy more GPUs. These will not be immediate expenses as is the case with OPEX, they will rather be capitalized and depreciated to a greater extent.\n\nWith that in mind, these companies also have large cash balances and huge capacities to borrow, since they generate massive revenues and are widely under-leveraged. What proportion of CAPEX comes from cash reserves and borrowing versus a reconfiguration from OPEX to CAPEX will determine how much actual GAAP profit these companies start to show in future quarters as this story begins to materialize.\n\nMy thesis is Amazon is the prime candidate for this future GAAP earnings growth, which will begin to make it seem as if profits are appearing out of thin air. In reality, these hyper-scalers were taking advantage of immediate expensing all along to dominate their markets and ramp up a customer base. With Amazon being famous for avoiding taxes to grow the top line, they may have no choice but to show larger GAAP profits should the need for larger CAPEX expenses dominate their immediate future.\n\nThe hour glass\n\nData by YCharts\n\nDuring Covid, Amazon massively ramped up logistic centers and other \"hard cost\" CAPEX spending. This also coincided with ultra-low interest rates where it made all the sense in the world to borrow in order to finance this expansion, and borrow they did. The LT debt line traces the CAPEX trend line almost to a T.\n\nNow, the cost of capital isn't cheap. Not only is Amazon faced with maintenance CAPEX demands from their newly built empire of data centers and warehouses, but they also have more industry pressure to pursue the same AI development as the rest of the MAG7 cadre ex NVIDIA who is the drug dealer. In my mind, I imagine a great portion of this maintenance and growth CAPEX now coming from a reconfiguration of OPEX R&D and SG&A, migrating to the cash flow statement.\n\nThis should result in lower operating expenses, which were always hailed as Amazon's greatest weapon, their operating leverage. This will in turn increase GAAP earnings. As this process slowly begins to take place, investors will begin to realize that Amazon wasn't really as expensive as they had assumed. Using the hourglass analogy, Amazon has historically placed the grains of sand in the accounting hourglass representing CAPEX at the top of the pile, with a greater proportion of OPEX at the bottom.\n\nWhich grains hit the bottom of the glass first will determine if we see more free cash flow or more GAAP earnings. While as a percentage of revenue, CAPEX recently has been highly competitive with OPEX, but the chart above demonstrates that debt was largely the co-factor rather than gross profit resources.\n\nHistorical OPEX as a percentage of revenue\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nHistorical CAPEX\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nRunning these two side by side, we currently see the following on a TTM basis:\n\nOPEX as a percentage of revenue: 39.57%\n\nCAPEX as a percentage of revenue: 9%\n\nIn previous articles I have written on Amazon, I observed that the sore thumb of operating leverage and tax sheltering came in the form of Research and development. The stock is up 61.9% since said previous article.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nUsing similar assumptions then as I am now, I found Amazon undervalued and continue to hold that belief.\n\nNick Sleep and Bill Miller were popular in pointing this out and noting that when backing this number out even by a quarter to half of what it is on a per-annum basis, Amazon appears to be un-profitable by choice. There is some controversy in this notion, what proportion of their R&D is needed to maintain current operations and what portion is purely by choice.\n\nMRQ revenue and profit breakdown\n\nHere is the MRQ revenue comps year over year:\n\nAmazon Investor Relations\n\nAs a percentage of sales, AWS keeps climbing. AWS now represents 25.6% of all sales, growing nearly $10 Billion year over year. This is the number investors focus on to the greatest extent, being that it is the profit growth driver. As we'll see later in the article, Amazon's AWS offering language is now littered with AI verbiage. They fully intend to join the headline parade of companies trying to become the leader in AI solutions.\n\nR&D and operating leverage\n\nWikipedia\n\nWhile the above is from 2022, and R&D expensing from Amazon has only increased since then, this is a great visualization of where Amazon sits in the pecking order for Research and Development. They are #1 in this expenditure by a fairly large margin. The company does have AWS and is constantly updating their e-commerce algorithms, but do they really need about 2x the budget of Google, which is almost purely in the realm of soft cost expensing and data science?\n\nmy own excel data from Seeking Alpha\n\nA visualization of what a complete add back of the R&D expense line to operating income shows the following:\n\n$132.54 Billion adj. operating income backing out R&D on a TTM basis.\n\nbacking out R&D on a TTM basis. This results in $12.73 per share currently in adjusted operating income per share when backing out R&D taking into consideration 10.406 Billion shares outstanding.\n\ncurrently in adjusted operating income per share when backing out R&D taking into consideration 10.406 Billion shares outstanding. A trailing 5 year CAGR of 19.39% can be seen in this metric from 2018-2023\n\nUsing a modified PEG ratio valuation based on this model would result in a multiplier of 19.39 as the growth rate being used becomes the multiplier in a PEG ratio analysis.\n\nThus 19.39 X $12.73= $246.98/share fair value\n\nTo clarify, the PEG ratio equivalent of 1, or Peter Lynch\u2019s fair value indicator for GARP, is simply the PE divided by the growth rate. So if I were assuming Amazon had a growth rate of 19.39%, then a P/E of 19.39 would be equivalent to a PEG ratio of 1 or, in other words, fair value. This instance visualizes adjusted operating income, which was that $12.73/share number backing out R&D. Thus, 12.73 x 19.39 would be equivalent to a modified PEG 1 since 19.39/19.39=1.\n\nSince my last article, this valuation method of Amazon has made me even more optimistic because I believe increased CAPEX requirements will continue to force Amazon to peel back OPEX and start to reveal how much operating leverage they really had all along.\n\nNvidia has turned the market on it's head and may help compress the market multiple\n\nThe following quip is from Marcelo Lima of the Heller House Opportunity Fund from 2018:\n\nThere is another reason \u201ccheap\u201d is a poor proxy for value: the new business models I described above\u2014SaaS in particular\u2014are not well suited to traditional GAAP accounting.Here\u2019s why: if distribution costs are zero, the optimal strategy is to gain as many customers for your software product, as quickly as possible. In digital businesses, there are increasing advantages to scale, and many of these companies operate in winner-take-all or winner-take-most markets. The name of the game is thus to build, grow, then monetize. Frequently, this means spending a lot of money in sales and marketing, which depresses reported earnings.Thus, SaaS companies spend to acquire customers upfront , and recognize revenue from those customers over many years . This mismatch burdens the income statement. Some of the most successful\u2014and highest performing stocks\u2014in the SaaS world have spent many years growing despite producing no meaningful accounting profits.- Marcelo Lima\n\nThis was one of the better summations I have stumbled across, succinctly highlighting the front-running success of many software-as-a-service models. This was also highlighted in Gautam Baid's The Joys of Compounding.\n\nIn a nutshell, the AI movement is forcing the hand of many successful SaaS companies to begin showing GAAP profits as hard costs related to data centers, GPUs, server racks, semiconductors etc. are making for far more capitalized costs than immediately expensed operating costs. This is a paradigm shift.\n\nNVIDIA is one of the greatest growth stories we've ever witnessed, I was wrong in previous assessments regarding NVIDIA's value and could have never imagined this earnings growth to have materialized. I was basing NVIDIA's value on trailing growth rates, which is a mistake for a cyclical stock. NVIDIA is currently enjoying the up cycle to end all up cycles that could last for several years. Truly amazing.\n\nEvery software company has to be all in on AI to appease their investor bases. This should spurn more economic growth in construction, and energy production. This should also help compress the multiple of the S&P 500 simply by changing the accounting equations of where the expenses are going. Like magic.\n\nAmazon AI plans\n\nFrom a recent article at GeekWire:\n\nAmazon is developing its own consumer-focused AI chatbot that would compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and could be revealed later this year, according to a report from Business Insider. The chatbot service, code-named \u201cMetis,\u201d would be accessed via web browser and powered by a new foundational model, according to Business Insider, which cited sources and documents. The move would add Amazon to a growing list of tech giants and startups offering new AI assistants, including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon-backed Anthropic, among several others. Amazon declined to comment in response to an inquiry from GeekWire.\n\nI guess we would have been naive to assume that Amazon was sitting on the sidelines and not developing competing IPs to Microsoft's ChatGPT. This is on top of improvements to Alexa that may see the cash burner go on a paid subscription model soon, and improved tool sets for AWS users.\n\naws.amazon.com\n\nThe promotional headline on AWS is generative AI. CEO Andy Jassy is certainly jumping on the AI wave, with more to come. Their GEN AI tools include the following:\n\nAmazon Q: Gen AI assistants\n\nAmazon Bedrock: Build and scale with LLMs and GEN AI tools\n\nAmazon SageMaker:Build and deploy FM models\n\nAI infrastructure: Train and run inference\n\nData Foundation: Build data foundation on AWS\n\nA few goals and use cases:\n\nChatbots and virtual assistants\n\nConversational analytics\n\nEmployee assistants\n\nCode generation\n\nAnalyst estimates and GAAP earnings expectations\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nMy estimate comes in above the high end, but just barely. At $246, I am on the bullish end of Wall St. Estimates, but still in line with what they are seeing.\n\nGAAP estimates\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nBalance sheet\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSimilarly to Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, Amazon has a cash and short-term investment fortress. On a TTM basis, they are now joining the ranks of the select few companies now earning a net profit on cash versus interest expense to the tune of $328 million. Having a negative interest rate is a great spot to be in. Cash remains well above long-term debt. The only issue with Amazon is share dilution, which continues. Rather than a dividend, we Amazon shareholders should be hoping for a buyback program to reduce the float as the first priority.\n\nForward-looking assumptions\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLooking at the high-end camp of Wall St. estimates, we can already see an expectation year over year in Amazon earnings growth for FY 24 versus FY 25 to be at 24%. With 2023 full year EPS at $2.95/share, the growth between then and the high end of 2025 would be a greater than 2 X in GAAP EPS growth for that period.\n\nI am quoting the high end because for all the reasons I mentioned the accounting abnormalities that will occur when Amazon and the other hyper-scalers start reconfiguring expensed OPEX to capitalized CAPEX will uncover greater GAAP earnings numbers than anyone could have ever anticipated.\n\nI think this moment in time is also exactly what Andy Jassy was put here for. He was the founder of AWS and is now going to be instrumental in transforming data centers into AI powerhouses. There may not be a more qualified CEO to chase down this TAM outside of Jensen Huang himself.\n\nI will continue to monitor this thesis and watch the percentage of OPEX to revenue vs CAPEX to revenue. The greater the change, the more bullish I would become.\n\nRisks\n\nWith all of the MAG 7 ex NVIDIA, the AI arms race is the biggest risk. A product being released not yet ready to be considered post-beta can cause a lot of negative headline risk. Additionally, blindly spending on data centers and GPUs to get ahead could result in a lot of waste, this goes for the entire group. Whoever thinks this through with the most clarity, will come out the back end in the best shape. Others may be stuck with a lot of worthless, depreciating assets that now need maintenance CAPEX on an ongoing basis.\n\nSummary\n\nAmazon and Google remain my two favorite, most fairly valued AI MAG 7 plays. They are also candidates to eventually be chip producers as they vie to control their own costs when it comes to data centers and cloud computing. I continue to buy, but not at the rate of 2022. I firmly believe the forward accounting changes are going to make several companies look cheaper than many realized. Buy.",

        "title": "Ahold Delhaize Offers A 4% Dividend Yield With A 45% Payout Ratio (OTCMKTS:ADRNY)",
        "body": "Pixelbizz/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nKoninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. ADR (OTCQX:ADRNY) (OTCQX:AHODF) is a Dutch grocery chain operator which generates the majority of its revenue in the US where it's active under the Food Lion and Hannaford brands. Just over 60% of the revenue is generated in the US.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nI would strongly recommend trading in Ahold's shares on Euronext Amsterdam where the stock is trading with AD as its ticker symbol with an average daily volume of approximately 2.2 million shares.\n\nYahoo Finance\n\nThe current share price is 27.82 EUR and multiplied by the share count of 938M shares outstanding. This results in a market cap of 26.1B EUR. In a previous article, I was looking forward to seeing the company execute on its 2025 guidance and I was pleased to see Ahold already reached its implied 2025 EPS in 2023, and it looks like 2024 will be another very decent year.\n\nAn OK first quarter, but full-year guidance is reiterated\n\nWhile the first quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily say much about the full-year expectations, it always provides an interesting starting point, not in the least because the financial results of a grocery chain provide a \"finger on the pulse\" when it comes to consumer behavior.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Ahold Delhaize reported revenue of 21.7B EUR, which is almost 0.5% higher than in Q1 2023. Unfortunately, the COGS increased by almost 1% as well, resulting in a 24M EUR decrease in the gross profit, which represents just under 0.5% compared to the 5.85B EUR in gross profit reported by Ahold Delhaize in Q1 2023.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nThe company was able to keep the other operating expenses pretty much in line with Q1 2023 (which definitely is a positive achievement) and that\u2019s why the operating income decreased by just 19M EUR, a better result than the 24M EUR gross profit decrease.\n\nUnfortunately, the net financial expenses increased by 24M EUR. This reduced the pre-tax and net income, and the latter came in at 513M EUR. This represents 0.54 EUR per share while the underlying EPS was approximately 0.59 EUR.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nThe cash flow result is at least as important as the income statement.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s operating cash flow before taking working capital elements into account was 1.72B EUR while the company paid just 43M EUR in taxes although the Q1 income statement indicated 150M EUR was due.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nWe should also deduct the 33M EUR in interest payments and the 462M EUR in lease payments. This results in an adjusted operating cash flow (including using the normalized tax bill of 150M EUR) of 1.08B EUR and 1.15B EUR including the interest income and lease income.\n\nThe total capex was 558M EUR, which resulted in an underlying free cash flow of around 590M EUR. Divided over the 938M shares outstanding, this represents a free cash flow result of 0.63 EUR.\n\nAhold Delhaize also reiterated its full-year outlook. Despite seeing an operating margin of just 3.7% in the first quarter of this year, the company still expects its full-year operating margin to come in at least 4%, which is in line with its historical performance.\n\nThe net income per share won\u2019t change dramatically as Ahold Delhaize is guiding for a flat EPS compared to FY 2023. That\u2019s perhaps somewhat disappointing given the company\u2019s rather aggressive stands on share buybacks, but what really matters is the anticipated free cash flow result of 2.3B EUR.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nBased on an anticipated share count of 915M shares (the current share count is 938M but I'm anticipating a net decrease of 23M shares as Ahold Delhaize is in the middle of a 1B EUR share buyback program), the 2.3B EUR free cash flow guidance represents an FCFPS of 2.51 EUR per share.\n\nI hope this will allow the company to hike its dividend once again. As you can see below, Ahold Delhaize has done pretty well in the past few years as its dividend has increased by in excess of 30% in the past four years.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nUsing the 1.10 EUR dividend paid over FY 2023, the dividend yield is approximately 4%, so Ahold Delhaize also is a reasonable income pick. The dividend payout ratio is just around 45%, so it should be very sustainable with plenty of opportunity to increase the dividend.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nThe current multiples make Ahold Delhaize pretty attractive. As per the company\u2019s full-year guidance (and confirmed by the Q1 results), the company is on track to generate roughly 2.5 EUR per share in free cash flow while the reported net income should be pretty close to that result as well. This means the grocery chain is trading at a 9% free cash flow yield, which makes it pretty attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget there may be a lot of hidden value in the owned real estate. The current value of the property, plant and equipment is just over 11B EUR. But as per the most recent detailed results (disclosed in the 2023 annual report), the buildings and land already include about 6.25B EUR in accumulated depreciation.\n\nAhold Investor Relations\n\nAt the end of Q1, the total book value per share was approximately 16.2 EUR, but approximately 85% of that amount was backed by intangible assets, resulting in a tangible book value of just a few euros per share. Assuming the buildings and land are worth at least the acquisition or construction cost, the underlying book value per share is higher than the reported book value per share. Including the intangible assets, Ahold Delhaize is trading at just around 1.2 times the book value, and that\u2019s not unreasonable for a grocery chain with a strong brand name and reputation.\n\nI am warming up to Ahold Delhaize again. I\u2019m a bit cash-strapped, but I may write some put options on Ahold Delhaize in the near future.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "body": "loveguli\n\nBy Tony DeSpirito\n\nKey takeaways\n\nMacro worries meet AI wonderwall. Stocks have managed to climb a wall of macro worries, thanks to largely solid earnings that we believe can expand beyond AI beneficiaries and continue to support prices. As Q3 begins, we look for:\n\nGreater dispersion as earnings growth broadens\n\nAlpha capacity in stocks chosen \u2015 and avoided\n\nFresh reason for an active bent in U.S. large caps\n\nU.S. stocks held onto gains in the second quarter, even as concerns over stubborn inflation, strong economic data and reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts sprinkled cold water on the Q1 hot streak. Markets found support in relatively strong Q1 earnings, led primarily by a small group of high-flying mega-cap stocks. We see the earnings-growth gap between these leaders and the rest closing later this year, as shown below. This presents a compelling opportunity for stock selection, as earnings feed valuations.\n\nWhile the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-caps were priced at roughly 34x earnings as of late May, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (SP500, SPX) traded at a much less demanding 17x. Yet a still-strong earnings profile means many of the top stocks aren't necessarily expensive relative to their growth prospects. In all cases, individual analysis is key to ensuring share prices are well aligned to company fundamentals.\n\nA narrowing gap and widening opportunity set\n\nConsensus analyst expectations for year-over-year earnings growth, 2023-2024\n\nSource: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from FactSet as of May 30, 2024.

Past performance is not indicative of current or future results. Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Click to enlarge\n\nParsing a 'stock picker's paradise'\n\nMacro factors (inflation, interest rates, etc.) still hold sway over daily moves at the broad index level, but we see company earnings growth as the catalyst for increased stock-level dispersion that could create mean reversion between the market's leaders and laggards.\n\nNotably, while we see the broad S&P 500 catching up to the Mag 7 toward the fourth quarter of this year, earnings growth looks particularly interesting for value stocks once you remove the index's AI-supercharged top stock, which has heavily skewed the averages. Under this analysis, earnings growth for the Russell 1000 Value Index takes the lead by the third quarter.\n\nThis is not to suggest an outright preference for value stocks, though the valuation gap between value and growth is quite wide today. It does, however, indicate there is some stored upside in value stocks that investors can look to exploit.\n\nDoing so may require looking to a style-pure value manager given that the indexes today are growth dominated. As shown below, the broad market is comprised of only 21% value names. The Russell 1000 Value Index belies its label at 57% core and growth, having experienced a 36% decline in value exposure over the past 25 years.\n\nTrue value is hard to find\n\nU.S. stock market style exposures, 2024\n\nSource: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data Morningstar as of April 30, 2024.

Click to enlarge\n\n\"A market in which earnings growth broadens beyond the prevailing leaders \u2015 creating dispersion in the process \u2015 is a stock picker's paradise.\"\n\nAlpha potential in opting out \u2026\n\nWe often note the merits of skilled stock selection in the pursuit of alpha. And avoiding underperformers can be as important as choosing outperformers in this pursuit of benchmark-beating returns.\n\nWhat are we avoiding today? Despite an overall preference for healthcare, we are skirting the big U.S. drug makers. Large-cap pharmaceutical companies face an inherent dilemma \u2015 in other industries, products are evergreen once deployed, but pharmaceuticals have the life of a patent cycle. When those patents expire and cheaper generics come to market, revenues inevitably decline.\n\nWe see several major U.S. pharma companies losing patent protection on up to 70% of their revenue by 2030. Estimates suggest the industry could face a $100 billion drop in revenue as a result. Profits are also at risk of disproportionate decline, as it's typically the oldest and highest-margin products that are losing patent protection.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. pharma is confronted with price pressure related to the Inflation Reduction Act ('IRA'), which gives Medicare the authority to begin negotiating prices on select drugs. That process is underway, with results (and potential price reductions) due in September.\n\nThe notable exception to our U.S. pharma aversion is the manufacturers of the newer GLP-1 \"diabesity\" drugs, which we believe are just beginning their success journey.\n\nSeveral of our teams within BlackRock Fundamental Equities are also trimming positions in financials, as interest rate cuts tend to affect bank margins, and parts of the consumer sectors, where the end of pandemic-era excess savings and high inflation are beginning to show up in greater spending discipline. Credit card data reveals an uptick in delinquency rates at lower income levels, increasing loss rates for financials. In technology, we see reductions in software and services offset by buying in semiconductors, where generative AI needs are crowding out other technology spending.\n\n\u2026 and leaning in\n\nBeyond the buying in semiconductors, we see a platform-level bullishness around AI that is manifesting in new ways to tap into the megatrend. Our investors are finding opportunities outside of the accepted AI winners. Examples include companies that own data and those that provide memory for storing it; power companies and industrials that supply into AI infrastructure needs, including those that equip data center cooling systems; and, more recently, opportunities in AI-ready PCs that are set to be introduced this year.\n\nSeveral of our active stock pickers are adding to positions in healthcare, with a preference for healthcare equipment and services. We have also been adding to communication services, including media and entertainment. Others are eyeing value in defensive areas of the market that were left behind in the cyclical rally since 2023. Utilities is one of these sectors. It is priced at a discount to the broad market and, we believe, poised for re-rating. The transition to renewable forms of energy will compel upgrades to existing power grids and push up private market electricity rates in the process, while the power required by a growing field of AI data centers is set to fuel a meaningful spike in energy demand.\n\nThe case for active U.S. large cap at the core\n\nInvestors have more choices than ever for building their investment portfolio, both in asset types and the vehicles for holding them. Conventional wisdom is that exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks is best achieved via passive index-tracking products, as the market is so efficient and transparent that there is little alpha to be captured via active stock selection. We disagree.\n\nAmple alpha potential\n\nMany prefer to apply active strategies in more niche and less transparent markets, such as emerging markets or U.S. small caps. We see wisdom in this but believe the alpha opportunity is much broader. The top stock by market cap in the S&P 500 is larger than the entire small-cap universe, suggesting to us that avoiding active in U.S. large caps means sacrificing tremendous alpha potential.\n\nThe analysis below shows that large-cap U.S. stocks historically have provided a meaningful alpha opportunity on the global stage. This is a function of the excess returns of the top quartile of managers alongside large U.S. representation in global markets. While top-quartile managers in less-efficient markets may generate a higher percentage of alpha (see EMEA and EM below), their impact on a whole portfolio could be less than a top- quartile U.S. large-cap manager given their smaller global representation, as summed in the far-right column.\n\nThe significance of the opportunity has swelled as the U.S. has grown to comprise a larger share of global indexes. U.S. representation in the MSCI ACWI is at 63% today, a steady climb from 37% in 1995. This record U.S. share comes at a time when the potential for active stock selection to generate above-market return is the greatest we have seen since before the period of moderation (in valuation, volatility and dispersion) that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nAs shown below, top-quartile managers in the U.S. have been able to achieve average excess returns of 3.2% over the past 20 years.* This means U.S. large caps' 543% cumulative return over the 20 years ended Dec. 31, 2023, could have amounted to more than 1,000% over that time period when applying the top-quartile manager alpha.\u2020\n\nAlpha analysis by region\n\nSource: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from FactSet, MSCI and eVestment, April 2024. Regions represented by the following eVestment categories: U.S. Large Cap Equity, All Emerging Markets and All Europe. MSCI ACWI weights are as of March 31, 2024, and top quartile excess returns are averages over the 20-year period from 2004-2023. Total alpha opportunity represents the current weight times the top quartile excess return. Figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Index returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. *Top quartile managers in the eVestment U.S. Large Cap Equity category delivered average excess returns of 3.2% annually from 2004-2023 compared to their primary prospectus benchmark. \u2020 U.S. large caps represented by the MSCI USA Index, which returned 9.75% annualized and 543% cumulative from 2004-2023. Top-quartile U.S. large-cap managers delivered average 3.2% annualized alpha in excess of primary prospectus benchmark during this period. 9.75% + 3.2% = 12.95%, equating to 1,042% cumulative return from 2004-2023. Analysis is hypothetical. Results do not reflect the deduction of management/advisory fees and other expenses, which would reduce returns. Click to enlarge\n\nAn emphasis on skill\n\nSkill does matter. The alpha generated by median managers has been negative in 67% of rolling one-year periods over the past 10 years. Yet the top quartile of alpha generators remained positive and posted returns as much as 16% higher than bottom-quartile managers since 1995, as shown in the chart below.\n\nTop managers have delivered across time\n\nAlpha differential, top vs. bottom managers, 1995-2023\n\nSource: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from eVestment as of Dec. 31, 2023. Chart shows the percent of excess alpha offered by the top quartile of managers over the bottom quartile in the eVestment U.S. Large Cap Equity category. Alpha is calculated as one-year excess returns, gross of fees, compared to primary prospectus benchmark. Figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Index returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Click to enlarge\n\nEven as median managers may continue to underperform, we see growing opportunity for skilled managers to add alpha given our outlook for greater earnings and valuation dispersion. Other research lends support:\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute ('BII') found that alpha from top-quartile large-cap U.S. equity managers increased in the post-COVID era (2020-2023) relative to the three years prior. Dispersion in alpha also edged higher, suggesting manager selection has become more important.\n\nResearch from BlackRock Risk and Quantitative Analysis has found dispersion to be higher in the U.S. compared to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, amplifying the opportunity to differentiate across U.S. equities.\n\nBank of America's Mutual Fund Performance Monitor reported in April that 64% of active managers had outperformed their benchmarks in Q1 2024, the best quarter since 2007.\n\nWe acknowledge that active investing is subject to periods of outperformance and periods of underperformance.\n\nWe believe the goal should be a steadier experience across time that results in alpha gains over a 5- to 10- year horizon. This requires sourcing a manager with a sufficiently strong investment process and fundamental research capabilities to offer long-run consistency, alongside a track record of providing an investment experience aligned to its stated objective.\n\nBottom line: The impact of alpha in the U.S. on the whole portfolio is significant and potentially misunderstood. Even lower U.S. alpha is meaningful in a whole-portfolio context given the increasingly outsized U.S. representation in global indexes. For investors seeking to increase their portfolios' alpha potential, we find large-cap U.S. equities to be an underappreciated place to target that exposure.\n\nThis material is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon as a forecast, research or investment advice, and is not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\n\nI would now like to turn the conference over to John Beisler, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Beisler\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the Crown Crafts' fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 conference call. Joining me on the call today are Crown Crafts' President and CEO, Olivia Elliott, and the company's CFO, Craig Demarest.\n\nEarlier this morning, Crown Crafts filed its 10-K and issued a press release regarding the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 financial results. A copy of this release is available on the company's website, crowncrafts.com.\n\nDuring today's call, the company will make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond Crown Crafts control, and the company is under no obligation to update these statements.\n\nFor more information about the company's risk factors and other uncertainties, please refer to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, I would like to remind you today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available through the company's Investor Relations page.\n\nNow I would like to turn the call over to the President and CEO, Olivia Elliott.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2024 was a transitional year for the company.\n\nWe started the year on the heels of acquiring and integrating Manhattan Toy as well as exploring the cross-selling opportunities made possible by the acquisition. We remain enthusiastic about the addition of Manhattan Toy as our offerings across the toy category continue to grow.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to leverage our long-standing relationships with major retailers and specialty stores to gain shelf space and position our brands for future growth. We also continued to proactively manage the impact of the economic headwinds facing our operations and our customers.\n\nInflationary pressures continue to linger, raising cost for materials and labor and reducing the discretionary income of consumers, which has a more meaningful impact on lower-income households.\n\nWe will continue to strategically manage our cost structure and sales process. We remain well-positioned with our balance sheet and expect to see some of the macro pressure lessen throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nDespite these current challenges, we were able to minimize the impact on gross margin by proactively managing costs across the business. As a result, we reported another year of profitability and we reduced our debt by $4.6 million from the end of fiscal 2023.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to Craig to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nCraig Demarest\n\nThank you, Olivia, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $22.6 million compared to $21.6 million in the prior year quarter. The increase reflects a full quarter's contribution from Manhattan Toy this year compared to two weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23.\n\nThis more than offset reduced orders from our customers, including a prior year feature from a major customer that was not repeated in the current year and the impact of consumers' response to the current macroeconomic conditions and adjusted inventory levels.\n\nGross profit for the quarter was 23.2% compared to 21.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The margin increase is primarily related to the effect of reserves recorded in the prior year associated with the customer who declared bankruptcy.\n\nMarketing and administrative expenses were $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, relatively unchanged to the prior year quarter despite the addition of Manhattan Toys marketing and administrative costs for a full quarter.\n\nWe worked throughout fiscal '24 to reduce the historical cost of both Manhattan Toy and our Legacy businesses. Net income for the quarter was $1 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to net income of $828,000 or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\nTurning now to our results for the full year. Net sales for fiscal '24 were $87.6 million compared to $75.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Manhattan Toy, which generated $18.5 million of net sales during fiscal '24 partially offset by a decline in our bedding blankets and accessories business.\n\nGross profit for the year was 26.2% compared to 26.4% in fiscal '23, reflecting the rent increase at our California warehouse last February, partially offset by the impact of product mix.\n\nMarketing and administrative expenses were $16.1 million versus $12.7 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Manhattan Toy at the end of fiscal '23. Net income for the year was $4.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.7 million or $0.56 per diluted share in fiscal '23.\n\nTurning now to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal '24 totaled $830,000 compared to $1.7 million at the end of the prior year. Inventories at the end of fiscal '24 were $29.7 million compared to $34.2 million at the end of fiscal '23. Our long-term debt at the end of fiscal '24 was $8.1 million compared to $12.7 million at the end of 2023.\n\nAnd finally, we paid $0.32 per share in cash dividends to shareholders in fiscal 2024, with a yield of 6.4% based on yesterday's close, we continue to believe our dividend is a key component towards offering long-term returns to our shareholders.\n\nNow I will turn the call back over to Olivia for additional comments.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThank you, Craig. We recently passed the one year mark since our acquisition of Manhattan Toy. In that time, we have successfully completed the brand's integration into Sassy, and the IT conversion is nearly finished.\n\nOn the operations side, we adjusted the brand's advertising spending and worked through the excess inventory to substantially improve the profitability of the brand compared to pre-acquisition periods. We are very encouraged by the strides Manhattan Toy has made on the product development front.\n\nCustomers have given positive feedback on the items viewed at recent events and they look forward to having these products on their shelves. As stated earlier, these new designs expand our offerings across the toy category, which now represents the largest portion of sales across our portfolio.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, we will continue to manage the macroeconomic challenges facing our business and consumers and expand the product offering across our brands. We believe we are well positioned for when the economy improves and our strong balance sheet will allow us to consider favorable acquisition opportunities that can strengthen our existing categories.\n\nWe would like to thank our team for their efforts over the past year and our customers and licensors for their continuing support. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year, and thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support.\n\nWith that, I'd like to open up the line for questions. Betsy?\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Doug Ruth with Lenox Financial Services. Please go ahead.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOlivia and Craig, congratulations. It was a very solid report. It checks all the boxes, revenue growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow, debt reduction and, of course, the dividend. So thank you for what you did for the shareholders.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThank you very much. We appreciate your support.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. Could you tell us a little bit more about -- so we know you had sales of $18.5 million of the Manhattan Toy. Would there be a -- are you able to make a projection what the goal might be for Manhattan Toy for fiscal 2025?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nWe really don't give projections. We kind of stay away from forecasting. I think the best thing to do is probably go back to what we said when we acquired Manhattan Toy and that's the goal in the long-term. It won't happen in fiscal '25. I think we said it was going to be $24 million. It's going to take three or four years to get there, but the projections are that we will grow steadily over those few years.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. Is it -- do you -- is it possible to get maybe get some placement for Manhattan Toy like in Walmart, maybe in fiscal 2025? Or would it take to be a longer time period than that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nNo, we had some placement in Walmart already, and that will be shipping sometime between the first and second quarter of fiscal '25. Just a handful of items, and it's in a limited number of stores, but it's a start.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nVery good. Congratulations. And then you also had talked about possibly combining the two warehouses, the Compton warehouse and then the Manhattan Toy warehouse. Is there any progress on that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nWe're still exploring that opportunity. We have engaged a third-party to help us kind of figure out where the best place to place those warehouses are that minimize the impact to our customers as well as to anybody that's working in those warehouses.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nWould you expect maybe something to happen in fiscal 2025? Or would we be looking beyond that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nI think you'll be looking beyond that. I think we -- by the end of fiscal 2025, I think we will have a plan, but I think any changes will happen in fiscal '26.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. And what about the sales and product development office in Minneapolis, you had previously stated that possibly we're hoping to do something with the lease. Is there any progress on that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThat one is going to be a more long-term process. I think that lease ends in the beginning of 2027. And unfortunately, Downtown Minneapolis has way too much open office space to be able to sublease it. So that's going to be a longer term issue.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. And what about the direct-to-consumer? How -- do you feel like you're making any progress with that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nWe have not gotten anybody except for Manhattan Toy up and running on the direct-to-consumer for our own website, but we have NoJo's website is now complete and able to sell direct-to-consumer. And we are working through right now getting Sassy's website up and running. And so I do believe by the end of fiscal 2025, we will have all of these subsidiaries selling direct-to-consumer.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. And what about -- how are things going for the company with Buy Buy Baby, you had previously told us that Buy Buy Baby had opened up, reopened some stores. Is there any progress with that initiative at all?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThey did reopen, I believe, 11 stores and we are shipping to all 11 of those stores, but I believe any expansion by them is slower, I think, than we had hoped it would be and they haven't opened up any new stores since the initial grand openings.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. And then I guess a couple more. There was recently an article about expansion of Legoland. And I know that was one of the things that came with the Manhattan Toy acquisition. How is that business going for the company?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThat business is actually going very well. And we are -- we believe there will be three new parks, two of which will be in China, and those will be opened in, I believe, this summer of 2025. And so we're continuing to grow that business, and we look forward to them opening the new parks. One of the ones in China will be the largest one in the world.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nWow. So that would potentially really expand the international sales?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nCorrect.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nAnd then the last question as I have was you did just did a tremendous job reducing the inventory. Are you happy with the inventory level where it's at? Or is there an objective for that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nI always think we have too much inventory. I do think we made great strides. We still have a little bit more, I'm going to say, close out inventory to work through, but I don't think it's -- it's not a huge number, but we always have something that we need to get rid of.\n\nDouglas Ruth\n\nOkay. Thank you for answering my questions. Congratulations to the team there. You've just done a really good job integrating the Manhattan Toy business into your core operation?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from John Deysher with Pinnacle. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nGood morning. Manhattan Toy, you said, I think it was $18.5 million in this fiscal year. I think you indicated last fiscal year, it was about 25.8% on a pro forma basis. If that's the case, that seems like a pretty significant drop, and I know you're going to let some accounts go. But how should we think about that decline in Manhattan Toy year-over-year?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nSome of the decline was planned. There was a there were some sales in the Legacy business to the original Buy Buy Baby that bankrupt. So that was a little bit of the decline. We had some customers that we stopped shipping to because they didn't have good credit. So that was planned as well. Once we got into it a little bit, it was a bigger drop, I guess, than we had planned initially because we realized that, for example, the direct-to-consumer business. They were spending as much on advertising as the top line sales. So obviously, when you're looking at something like that, the sales were at a 30% loss. So we sacrificed some top line sales to improve the bottom line. But we are -- we've been working throughout the year to get better costings to move our products to new factories where we can get better prices out of China. And I think that as time goes by, you'll see those sales pick back up.\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nOkay. So do you think the $18.5 million this fiscal year was the trough?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nI do think that.\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nOkay. All right. So that should go up. And on the flip side, if we back out Manhattan Toy from the Legacy business, it looks like the Legacy year sales were about $69 million versus $49 million obviously a big jump. So what do you attribute that?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThat was last year versus this year? Are you looking further back?\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nNo, I'm just looking if we subtract the $18.5 million from the $87.6 million that's about $69 million. And if we subtract the $25.8, I'm sorry, I'm making apples -- yeah, I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. Sorry. Delete that last question. That was my error.\n\nCraig Demarest\n\nThere'd be a slight decline, yes.\n\nJohn Deysher\n\nYes, slight decline. Legacy, okay. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Dennis Scannell with Rutabaga Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis Scannell\n\nYes. Good morning, Olivia and Craig. Just a couple of quick things for me. A quick question on gross margins in the fourth quarter. So gross margins were down, I'm sorry, gross margins were up year-over-year nicely, but down sequentially kind of what we were doing in the first three quarters, it looks like we're kind of around 27%. Is that just a seasonal issue or mix? Or just any commentary on the decline relative to the previous three quarters.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThat's more of a timing issue. You see a little bit of a pullback when I hate to talk about burden variances, et cetera. But I mean, you see a little bit of a negative burden variance when you get into Q4 because of Chinese New Year, so we're bringing less inventory in during that time of year. So it's more of a seasonal or a timing thing.\n\nDennis Scannell\n\nGot it. Okay. Great. Thank you. So and then looking at for the full year around, sorry, where my notes went, around 26%. In past years, certainly before inflation really took off when we saw the softness on the consumer side, we had seen kind of gross margins 29%, maybe even 30%, it looks like fiscal '21 is recognizing that the mix of business has changed somewhat, particularly with the acquisition of Manhattan Toys. Is 29%, 30% gross margins a potential for the business going forward? Or is that not realistic?\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nI mean I think it's a potential in the longer term future. The biggest thing that's impacting us right now is the increase in the rent at the warehouse in California. So that's had a big impact on us. And until we get that long-term solution, there's -- it's not going to be at 30%, I don't think.\n\nDennis Scannell\n\nYes, okay. Okay. And when you say just out of curiosity on the -- so in -- for the rents in California. It's not that you're looking to exit that? Or are you looking for another maybe a lower cost facility. Is there a solution to that rent, I guess, is my question.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nWe are working on that solution. And so we're -- we've engaged a third-party to help us with that move because if you're going to move a warehouse that you've been in for 25, 30 years, we need to have the plan to be there for 10 to 20 years at least on the forward-looking side. So we want to make sure that we do it right. So it is something that's going to take us 18 months to two years to get the long-term solution.\n\nDennis Scannell\n\nGot it. Interesting. Okay. And so an opportunity there. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Olivia Elliott for any closing remarks.\n\nOlivia Elliott\n\nWe'd just like to thank you for your support over the years and we look forward to updating you on our Q1 earnings, which will be in mid-August. Thank you very much.\n\nCraig Demarest\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that there was a buildup of inventory in the Company's distribution channels; (2) that the Company and its distributors were reasonably likely to offer aggressive discounts to reduce the high channel inventories; (3) that the Company's revenue would decline sequentially until the excess channel inventory was sold through; (4) that Cambium was likely to incur significant charges to writedown excess and obsolete inventory; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings would be adversely affected; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\nOn August 1, 2023, after the market closed, Cambium reported that second quarter 2023 revenue fell 23% sequentially due to higher channel inventories that resulted in lower demand for Enterprise products. As a result, the Company reduced its fiscal 2023 guidance, now expecting revenue to decline 7% to 11% year-over-year. The Company also announced that the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Atul Bhatnagar, would step down immediately.\n\nOn this news, the price of Cambium shares declined by $4.89 per share, or 30.07%, to close at $11.37 per share on August 2, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThen, on October 4, 2023, after the market closed, Cambium announced preliminary third quarter 2023 revenue between $40.0-$45.0 million compared to the previous outlook of $62.0-$70.0 million[.] The Company attributed the shortfall to, in part, a decrease in orders and an increase in stock rotations from distributors in the Enterprise business and pressure from channel inventories.\n\nOn this news, the price of Cambium shares declined by $2.87 per share, or 36.2%, to close at $5.05 per share on October 5, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThen, on January 18, 2024, after the market closed, Cambium revealed that preliminary fourth quarter 2023 revenue was expected to be approximately $40.0 million compared to the previous outlook of $45.0-$50.0[.] The Company attributed the revenue shortfall to offering aggressive Enterprise product discounts to clear excess channel inventories. The Company further revealed gross margin will also be below the low end of the range due to increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves. Moreover, the Company's Chief Financial Officer would depart Cambium on February 2, 2024.\n\nOn this news, the price of Cambium shares declined by $0.60 per share, or 12.40%, to close at $4.24 per share on January 19, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

        "title": "US Supreme Court curbs federal agency powers, overturning 1984 precedent By Reuters",
        "body": "By John Kruzel\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a major blow to federal regulatory power on Friday by overturning a 1984 precedent that had given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, handing a defeat to President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe justices ruled 6-3 in favor of fishing companies that challenged a government-run program partly funded by industry that monitored overfishing of herring off New England's coast. It marked the latest decision in recent years powered by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that hemmed in the authority of federal agencies.\n\nThe precedent that the court overturned arose from a ruling involving oil company Chevron (NYSE: ) that had called for judges to defer to reasonable federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous. This doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests, was called \"Chevron deference.\"\n\nThe decreasing productivity of Congress - thanks to its gaping partisan divide - has led to a growing reliance, especially by Democratic presidents, on rules issued by U.S. agencies to realize regulatory goals.\n\nThe 1984 precedent, set in a ruling involving oil company Chevron, has called for judges to defer to federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws that are deemed to be ambiguous. This doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests, is called \"Chevron deference.\"\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden's administration had defended the National Marine Fisheries Service regulation at issue and the Chevron deference doctrine. The fish conservation program was started in 2020 under Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe regulation called for certain commercial fishermen to carry aboard their vessels U.S. government contractors and pay for their at-sea services while they monitored the catch.\n\nThe companies - led by New Jersey-based Loper Bright Enterprises and Rhode Island-based Relentless Inc - in 2020 sued the fisheries service, claiming the monitoring program exceeded the Commerce Department agency's authority.\n\nThe bid by the fishermen was supported by various conservative and corporate interest groups including billionaire Charles Koch's network. The litigation is part of what has been termed the \"war on the administrative state,\" an effort to weaken the federal agency bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements executive action.\n\nThe Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has signaled skepticism toward expansive regulatory power, issuing rulings in recent years to rein in what its conservative justices have viewed as overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.\n\nThe fish conservation program aimed to monitor 50 percent of declared herring fishing trips in the regulated area, with program costs split between the federal government and the fishing industry. The cost to commercial fishermen of paying for the monitoring was an estimated $710 per day for 19 days a year, which could reduce a vessel's income by up to 20 percent, according to government figures.\n\nThe Biden administration said the program was authorized under a 1976 federal law called the Magnuson-Stevens Act to protect against overfishing in U.S. coastal waters. It said in court papers the program was suspended for the fishing year starting in April 2023 due to insufficient federal funding.\n\nThe Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled in favor of the government.\n\nThe Biden administration said Chevron deference among other things \"gives due weight to the expertise that agencies bring to bear\" and promotes national uniformity in the administration of federal law.\n\nAn attorney for the commercial fishermen said Chevron deference \"incentivizes a dynamic where Congress does far less than the Framers (of the U.S. Constitution) anticipated, and the executive branch is left to do far more by deciding controversial issues via regulatory fiat.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has issued other rulings this term involving the scope of agency powers, including two rulings on Thursday. It rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission's in-house enforcement of laws protecting investors against securities fraud. It also blocked an Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone emissions that may worsen air pollution in neighboring states.\n\nThe justices on May 16 upheld the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan industry.",

        "body": "Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Scotts To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options\n\n\n\nIf you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Scotts between November 3, 2021, and August 1, 2023 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). You may also click here for additional information: www.faruqilaw.com/SMG.\n\nNEW YORK, June 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE: ) (Scotts or the Company) (NYSE: SMG) and reminds investors of the August 5, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: the Company's inventory levels, debt covenant compliance, and financial performance. Specifically, Defendants repeatedly assured investors that the Company's inventory levels were appropriate, while attributing strong sales to selling through high-cost inventory, which resulted in peak selling and record shipments. Defendants also repeatedly assuaged investors' concerns about the Company's debt, stating that they were optimistic we will remain within the bounds of our bank covenants and [did] not see leverage compliance issues going forward. As a result of these misrepresentations, Scotts common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.\n\nThe truth began to emerge on June 8, 2022, when Scotts admitted that replenishment orders from its U.S. retailers were more than $300 million below target in the month of May alone. The Company told investors that 2022 full-year earnings would be roughly half of its prior guidance. The Company also announced plans to take on additional debt to cover restructuring charges as it attempted to cut costs.\n\nIn response to these disclosures, the price of Scotts common stock declined by $9.05 per share, or nearly 9%, from a closing price of $102.18 per share on June 7, 2022, to a closing price of $93.13 per share on June 8, 2022.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, Scotts revealed that quarterly sales for its fiscal third quarter had declined by 6%, and that gross margins fell by 420 basis points. The Company also slashed fiscal year EBITDA guidance by a staggering 25% and announced a $20 million write down of pandemic driven excess inventories. The Company also disclosed that it had to modify its debt covenants to 7.00 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio, from the former ratio of 6.25 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\n\nThese disclosures caused the price of Scotts common stock to decline by $13.58 per share, or 19%, from a closing price of $71.44 per share on August 1, 2023, to a closing price of $57.86 per share on August 2, 2023.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Scotts' conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Scotts Miracle-Gro class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/SMG or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook (NASDAQ: ).\n\nAttorney Advertising.

        "title": "Dealmakers optimistic on global M&A prospects despite sluggish growth By Reuters",
        "body": "By Anirban Sen and Anousha Sakoui\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity grew at a sluggish pace in the second quarter, yet many dealmakers are upbeat, forecasting transactions will pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nStubbornly high interest rates, a hostile regulatory environment and a frothy stock market that has made valuations pricey weighed on dealmaking in the last three months.\n\nThe number of deals signed globally in the second quarter fell 21% to 7,949, according to data from Dealogic. Deal volumes grew 3.7% to $769.1 billion. The number worth $10 billion or more fell to six during the quarter, from eight in the year-ago period.\n\nTop investment bankers and deal lawyers brushed off concerns about the health of the M&A market, saying their pipelines were in robust shape going into the latter half of the year.\n\n\"It just feels like a regular old M&A year, and I think we'll just keep cruising along,\" said Damien Zoubek, co-head of U.S. corporate and M&A at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. \"CEO confidence is very high and while there's a lot of geopolitical risk going on, people feel pretty good about the economic outlook.\"\n\nSome advisers noted the rate of dealmaking has returned to levels seen in the pre-pandemic years of 2018 and 2019, when deal volumes averaged about $4 trillion a year.\n\nThe pace of buyout activity led by private equity firms surged 41% to $286 billion during the first half, helped mainly by a higher number of take-private deals, giving dealmakers hopes of a return of large leveraged buyouts in the near term.\n\n\"The driver for the second half of the year could potentially be a real revitalization in private equity activity,\" said Jay Hofmann, co-head of M&A for North America at JPMorgan. \"We've had this kind of arm-wrestling match between valuations on the one hand, and the desire to deliver the overall returns that private equity has done over the last 10-12 years. And on the other hand, there is the DPI (distributed to paid-in capital) demand from limited partners, and it seems pretty clear that DPI is going to win.\"\n\nU.S. M&A volumes were down 3% during the quarter to $324.4 billion. However, deal activity in Europe rebounded and jumped 27%, driven largely by the value of some large transactions. Asia-Pacific deal volumes fell 18%.\n\n\"We have seen Europe bounce back this quarter \u2013 and that is because Europe continues to offer attractive valuations, the rate environment is moderating and the macro backdrop is improving, although the recent increase in political uncertainty needs to be navigated,\" said Cathal Deasy, global co-head of investment banking at Barclays.\n\nDriving the recovery of private equity dealmaking has been the increased availability of capital due to the burgeoning business of private credit, which is increasingly grabbing market share away from traditional bank loans.\n\n\"Private credit funds are going to continue to play a material and probably growing role in the financing markets - but the banks will also continue to play a role,\" said Dan Mendelow, co-head of U.S. investment banking at Evercore. \"Banks have begun to either partner with private credit funds or they are raising their own funds so that they can have that same product capability.\"\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE: )' $22.5 billion takeover of Marathon Oil (NYSE: ), Silver Lake's $13 billion take-private of Endeavor Group Holdings and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: )'s $13 billion acquisition of Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ: ) ranked as the largest deals of the quarter.\n\n\"The growth rates in the U.S. continue to be more attractive than most other places in the Western world, and the U.S. capital markets are deeper than anywhere else. So if you're a U.S. corporate, the bar to investing outside the U.S. has gotten higher,\" said Jim Langston, an M&A partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\nWhile large deal activity remained at healthy levels, bankers pointed out the number of so-called \"megadeals\", or those worth more than $25 billion, has slowed down compared to previous M&A cycles due to heightened antitrust scrutiny.\n\nGAP NARROWING\n\nTop M&A rainmakers said they are starting to see early signs of a narrowing in the gap in valuation expectations between buyers and sellers.\n\n\"We are getting closer to a more normalized M&A market as agreement on price gets easier in an environment with an expected downward trajectory on interest rates, a solid economic outlook and low volatility,\" said Eamon Brabazon, co-head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Bank of America.\n\nThe world's biggest corporations, armed with big balance sheets, are still pushing ahead with their pursuit of sizable targets, deal advisers said, adding upcoming elections in the U.S. and other parts of the world so far had no impact on talks between buyers and sellers.\n\nIn Europe, miner BHP's failed $49 billion bid for Anglo American (JO: ) was a sign of a resurgent acquisition drive.\n\n\"People are more comfortable with where the world is right now,\" said Andre Kelleners, head of EMEA M&A at Goldman Sachs. \"There's a huge move into risk assets more broadly in the markets, but you can also feel that corporate psychology is one that looks at the world as more resilient, more predictable, less volatile, less uncertain than it was 12 to 18 months ago.\"\n\nWhile overall activity levels were sluggish during the quarter, so-called corporate clarity deals - or structured M&A deals that include spin-offs and carve-outs - proved to be a bright spot for dealmakers.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen a growing number of companies that are considering and pursuing carve-out type transactions for a spin off or sale - there's a lot of appeal to separating non-core or low-growth businesses,\" said Allison Schneirov, a global head of Skadden's transactions practice. \"In that way, companies can retain flexibility during the transaction process and entertain third party bids.\"",

        "body": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nokia (HE: )'s bid to buy U.S. optical networking gear maker Infinera (NASDAQ: ) in a $2.3 billion deal puts the Finnish company on track to gain from the billions of dollars in investment pouring into data centres to cater to the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe deal would help Nokia to leapfrog Ciena (NYSE: ) and become the second largest vendor in the optical networking market with a 20% share, behind Huawei, which is benefiting from the minimal presence of Western companies in China.\n\nTelecom gear makers, struggling with lower sales of 5G equipment, have been looking for ways to diversify their markets and get into growing areas such as AI.\n\nNokia's move will allow the company to sell more equipment to big tech companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as they invest billions of dollars in building new data centres to service the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"This is pretty optimal timing for a deal of this nature when you are timing it just before the market is expected to start to recover,\" Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark said in an interview with Reuters.\n\n\"AI is driving significant investments in data centres ... one of the key attractions of this acquisition is that it significantly increases our exposure to data centres,\" he said.\n\nData centres use optical transport networks - cables made of glass that transmit digital signals - to allow electronic devices to talk to each other.\n\nInfinera is especially strong in intra data centre communications, which refers to server-to-server communications inside data centers. This will be one of the fastest growing segments in the overall communications technology market, Lundmark said.\n\nNokia shares rose 4% in morning trade, signaling that the shareholders are bullish about the deal. The share price of buyers would typically ease due to dilution in a cash-and-stock deal.\n\nNokia, which will pay 70% of the purchase price in cash and the rest in stock, expects to save 200 million euros ($213.88 million) in costs following the deal's closure next year.\n\nWhile the purchase multiple may be somewhat steep as Infinera had a lumpy growth trajectory, if Nokia could extract the 200 million euros in synergies, then the purchase price would be justified, said Mads Rosendal, analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research.\n\nInfinera gets about 60% of its business from the United States, while Nokia had a bigger share in Europe and Asia, making it a complementary transaction, said Lundmark.\n\n\"The two businesses together have combined cost of sales of over 2 billion euros and operating expenses of over a billion euros ... so against that target, 200 million (euros) is not a particular stretch,\" Lundmark said, adding that it was too early to comment on potential layoffs.\n\n($1 = 0.9351 euros)",

        "title": "Amazon is doubling value of credits for some startups to build on AWS as Microsoft cloud gains ground",
        "body": "Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.\n\nAmazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.\n\nStarting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.\n\nTwo people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.\n\nMatt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.\n\nAn AWS spokesperson confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley. The spokesperson added that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years.\n\nAmazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.\n\nBut Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.\n\nAmazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.\n\nLast month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft \"ran laps around\" AWS in generative AI.\n\nStartups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIn November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.\n\nStartups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.\n\nIn addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. \"Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,\" Adept said in a blog post.\n\nWATCH: AWS will boost investments in Singapore's cloud infrastructure by $9 billion",

He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Biden has said that he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it. His argument rests largely on the fact that he beat Mr. Trump in 2020,\" it said. \"That is no longer a sufficient rationale for why Mr. Biden should be the Democratic nominee this year.\"\n\nThe stunning editorial came a day after Biden gave a blundering performance in his first debate against Trump in the 2024 White House race.\n\n''It should be remembered that Mr. Biden challenged Mr. Trump to this verbal duel,'' the editorial said. \"He set the rules, and he insisted on a date months earlier than any previous general election debate. He understood that he needed to address longstanding public concerns about his mental acuity and that he needed to do so as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"The truth Mr. Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test.\"\n\nThe editorial comes as a number of Democrats and fundraisers consider pushing for Biden to step aside in the contest.\n\nThe Times editorial board for decades has been the leading liberal newspaper editorial voice in the United States.\n\nBut in recent years, the paper's news section has been criticized by some liberals for its coverage of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and Biden.",

        "title": "How to survive Paris during the 2024 Olympics",
        "body": "The most anticipated sporting event is only a month away\u2014and it happens to be in the most visited city in the world: Paris.\n\nAside from the picturesque streets, fragrant cafes, and stray cyclists, the French capital will also be swarming with spectators\u2014over 15 million are just arriving for the Paris Games.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to locals and other French residents traveling to the capital from different parts of the country.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Paris can be a lot. Recently, the city has grappled with a bed bug outbreak, dengue scares, petty crime, public transport workers\u2019 strikes, and more.\n\nGiven the twin popularity of the Olympics and Paris, surviving (and thriving) in the city can feel like hard work. Although Paris got a feel for managing big crowds that flocked to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concerts earlier this year, the Olympics and Paralympics will have the city buzzing with activity over an extended period.\n\nBut fret not\u2014Fortune spoke to tourism, insurance, banking, and culture experts for their tips on navigating the city and having a great experience.\n\nGetting around\n\nPassengers at a metro station in Paris. Jan Woitas\u2014picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nLike its other big city peers, Paris has an infamous traffic problem. In the lead-up to the Olympics, several hotspots in the city will be cordoned off, restricting taxi access.\n\n\u201cThe biggest pitfall is going to be the traffic. It will be very hard to find your way around it, which is why being centrally located at a perfect hotel is the key,\u201d said Jonathan Alder, founder of travel management company Jonathan\u2019s Travels.\n\n\u201cThis level of crowds is going to be a challenge for Paris, specifically when it comes to traffic and crowding. For guests willing to pay for the top hospitality packages, they have created a workaround with a special traffic lane that will only be available to specific vehicles,\u201d Alder told Fortune.\n\nIf you plan to visit other parts of France before getting to Paris, he cautions against connecting via a major Paris airport\u2014whether Charles de Gaulle Airport or Paris-Orly.\n\nWhile cabs (identifiable with a \u201ctaxi\u201d sign on their hoods) are very much an option, public transport is still the best way to get around the city. Road and station closures could hamper some routes, so the RATP and Public Transport Paris 2024 apps will be your friends for real-time updates on what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Also, keep your eyes and ears open in case of any protests in the areas you\u2019re heading to. Don\u2019t forget to leave enough buffer time for delays.\n\nOther safe alternatives include carpooling, renting cycles (a V\u00e9lib pass could be helpful), and exploring areas by foot.\n\nUber is offering free ferries across the Seine River from July 12 to August 3 in addition to taxis.\n\nBeware of your Euros\n\nIt\u2019s good to keep some (but not too many) Euros in hand. Andrzej Rostek\u2014Getty Images\n\nWhen in Paris, beware of how and where you access your money. Tourists habitually convert local currencies to their home currency to find the best deals in shopping and buying food. The implication? Exchange rates change daily, even if only by a small percentage, and it costs to use your home currency if you aren\u2019t careful.\n\nAlways have some (but not a lot) euros handy and make sure to transact only in euros even when credit card machines prompt you otherwise, London-based fintech firm Wise said in a report about preparing for the Paris Olympics. It also warns against resorting to airport or hotel exchanges, which deliberately charge you more.\n\n\u201cAirports and hotels cater to a captive audience. Their exchange services will reflect this in\n\ntheir higher fees and poorer rates,\u201d the report said.\n\nOther suggested tips include having backup payment options in case your primary card fails and checking if your home bank has any affiliates in France that\u2019ll absorb some of the transaction fees.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing people need to be aware of when exploring the streets of Paris\u2014the pickpockets.\n\n\u201cWith more tourists in the city, there may be an increase in petty crime and scams targeting visitors,\u201d said Johannes Thomas, the CEO of German-based travel platform Trivago, citing the example of \u201cthe friendship bracelet scam\u201d at attractions like Sacre-Coeur.\n\n\u201cAvoid flashing any valuables or cash that may draw negative attention. Additionally, avoid street performers or street games, especially [ones] involving money, as this can often be a planned distraction to set up a pickpocket.\u201d\n\nBetter safe than sorry\n\nBeware of the pick pockets. Peter Dazeley\u2014Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s no easy way out with the crowds, no matter where in Paris you go. So, it\u2019s probably best to embrace it, Thomas said.\n\n\u201cExpect overcrowding, long lines and overwhelmed services at popular tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and other major sites. Anticipate increased prices. Accommodation, food and transportation costs tend to spike during major events. Visitors may face significantly higher prices, especially for hotels and short-term rentals in central Paris,\u201d he added.\n\nPlanning trips during peak travel season often brings uncertainties\u2014delays, last-minute cancellations, lost bags, and more. It\u2019s tricky to prepare for each of these scenarios, but travel insurance can be the key to feeling more in control of your trip.\n\nPeople could face three types of risks when traveling: financial, medical and travel, Rajeev Shrivastava, founder and CEO of VisitorsCoverage, a travel and health insurance marketplace, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cPeople [who] are making these trips have made some heavy investments, including their tickets and the stay,\u201d Shrivastava said.\n\nThe risks of impromptu cancellations, peak summer heat, and rampant petty crime could become unnecessary stressors in a long-anticipated trip. That\u2019s where travel insurance can help\u2014it lifts the burden off visitors, protecting them in case of unforeseen losses.\n\n\u201cMany insurance policies have coverage for many of these events,\u201d Shrivastava said, adding that insurance is a tool that people consider with varying degrees of seriousness, depending on how much they\u2019ve traveled.\n\nShrivastava says another way to ensure safety is to have emergency contacts who travelers can contact.\n\n\u201cLet your family remain informed [or] whoever you believe and trust about where you are, where you\u2019re traveling to, and what of transportation you are taking,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen in France\u2026 try being French?\n\nTime to brush up on your French skills. Westend61\u2014Getty Images\n\nCruising your way through Paris isn\u2019t just about getting on the right bus or staying in the right neighborhood. It\u2019s also about taking in some of the culture and blending into the city where you can. Noel Wolf, a language teacher and cultural expert at language learning platform Babbel, thinks learning some basic phrases can be a game-changer.\n\n\u201cNot only does being able to communicate in the local language facilitate cultural connection, but it is crucial for keeping travelers safe in high-stress, large-scale events such as the Olympics,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nBrushing up on your French will also come in handy when asking for directions or seeking help, making you feel more safe. People tend to regret not knowing the local language, adding to the stress of travel, Babbel found in a survey.\n\n\u201cTravelers will also need to familiarize themselves with the geography and public transportation in Paris, so in the event of an emergency or getting separated from their travel partners, attendees can have a general idea of where they are within the city and navigate their way back home,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nOther etiquette tips, such as saying \u201cBonjour\u201d and keeping a low voice at restaurants, are also helpful to remember.\n\nAnd with that, you should be all set for a Parisian summer. Safe travels, or as the French would say, bon voyage!",

        "body": "Do you spend more time in bed with your laptop, answering Slack messages, than you do with your partner? Then it may be time for a reality check.\n\nWhen our romantic relationships carry too much of the burden of our professional life, it can lead to resentment, jealousy, and, ultimately, a breakup\u2014especially when we expect our partners to carry an unfair share of our work stress.\n\n\u201cWe bring a set of expectations that our intimate partners are a source of emotional support, and that we can be our most authentic versions of ourselves,\u201d Alexandra Solomon, a Chicago-based psychologist and host of the podcast Reimagining Love, tells Fortune. And while it\u2019s a \u201cblessing\u201d when find that, she adds, \u201cIt comes back to bite us when we\u2019re not mindful of the impact that our burnout has on how we\u2019re showing up for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a widespread problem: In Deloitte\u2019s Workplace Burnout Survey, for example, 83% of respondents said burnout from work can negatively impact their personal relationships. Similarly, in Headspace\u2019s 2024 Workforce State of Mind report, 71% of employees shared that work stress has caused a personal relationship to end.\n\nA big part of the problem, Solomon says, is that the boundary between work and home life, especially with remote and hybrid work structures, can be difficult to draw. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to set time and energy aside for each facet of our lives, including time to connect with our partners\u2013\u2013outside of discussing work projects.\n\nHere are five tips for ensuring work burnout doesn\u2019t squash the romance in your life.\n\n1. Resist the urge to compare\n\nOften, when both partners are having a difficult time at work, Solomon says there is a tendency to become competitive\u2014with a workplace-stress Olympics, if you will.\n\n\u201cThe conversation can begin like, \u2018I want to share my day with you because you are a really important sounding board and safe place,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut the conversation can have a sneaky way of morphing into a comparison of who has it worse.\u201d\n\nSolomon suggests resisting the urge to compare your experience with your partner\u2019s, and to remember that all stress\u2014including the kind that comes about in this type of competition\u2014is unwanted and can have a negative impact on our health.\n\n2. Set \u2018micro rituals\u2018\n\nCreating ways to symbolize the transition from working time to home time\u2014even, if not especially, if you work from home\u2014can be pivotal for the strength of your relationship.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s their commute home, or when you\u2019re changing clothes from your workday, almost ritualizing, \u2018I\u2019m taking off the day, I have done my job, I showed up, I did what I was supposed to do. It will be waiting for me tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever kind of ways you can set a micro ritual to transition from the workday to time with your partner,\u201d she says, it will be worth it.\n\n3. Performance reviews aren\u2019t just for the office\n\nPerformance metrics, desired raises, and a basic need to stay employed are all reliable motivators when it comes to doing a great job at work. But what about staying motivated at home?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think, \u2018A year from now I want to feel more connected to my partner,\u2019 \u2018I want us to have accomplished this goal in our life,\u201d Jenna Glover, licensed psychologist and Chief Clinical Officer at Headspace, tells Fortune. But, she stresses, maybe we should.\n\n\u201cPart of that is intentionality and really bringing it to that [home] space,\u201d Glover explains. \u201cAnd when people do, they\u2019re able to be successful in both work and relationships.\u201d\n\nGlover suggests relationship performance reviews as one way to ensure we don\u2019t lose ourselves in work or miss out on important time with our partner.\n\n\u201cTake time to say, \u2018There is not a template built for what it means to be successful in my relationship like a work performance review, but I\u2019m going to take the time to identify what that would actually look like,\u2019\u201d she suggests.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about it being too formal. Instead, Glover says the point is to focus while sitting down with your partner and sharing goals and expectations for your family, your career, and your one-on-one connection.\n\n4. Salvage \u2018romance\u2019 by defining it expansively\n\nIt\u2019s true that stress impacts libido. According to the Cleveland Clinic, stress can reduce your sex drive by taking your mind off sexual desire, and chronic stress can interfere with hormone levels, which also results in a lower libido.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s desire increases because of pressure,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nBut romance and connection with your partner do not have to start and end with sex, she says.\n\n\u201cThe definition of \u2018romantic\u2019 is the stuff we do that helps us feel connected,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there are lots of ways to feel connected besides sex.\u201d\n\nShe suggests making small but meaningful nods toward intimacy and toward counteracting your work burnout\u2014playing a game with your partner, dancing in the kitchen together, or lighting candles while you eat dinner, for example.\n\n\u201cPart of it is pushing back,\u201d Solomon says, \u201cand saying, \u2018No, my job does not get to take both my time and my sexual energy.\u2019\u201d\n\n5. Try to avoid putting your partner on the defensive\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re missing out on time with your partner due either one of your jobs (or both), a gentle way to start trying to counteract that is to ease into a conversation about it: How about an evening with no screens? What about scheduling a fun outing? Your partner cannot always read your mind or body language for clues as to what you want, Solomon says.\n\nBut pointing fingers and laying blame, she adds, can lead to them feeling attacked and guilty, putting them on the defense. Instead, take a beat to calmly tell your partner you miss their undivided attention.\n\nPlus, she stresses, work burnout is often, if not always, about the company culture rather than the employee. So while it can be easy to put the blame on your partner for answering messages about work after hours, it\u2019s also up to their employer to adhere to off-the-clock boundaries.\n\n\u201c[Your partner] didn\u2019t create the corporate culture that demands that people are available at all hours, or refuses to hire the right number of people to do the work, or whatever the dynamics are in the organization,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think that part of it, too, is making sure to put responsibility where responsibility goes.\u201d\n\nIn fact, nearly 70% of professionals, according to Deloitte, feel their employers are not doing enough to prevent or alleviate burnout within their organization, and 21% say their company does not offer any programs or initiatives to prevent or alleviate it.\n\n\u201cPeople need to work. So it\u2019s really important for employees to think about, \u2018What is my work experience like?\u2019 and hopefully work is there to support the quality of your life and not to degrade it,\u201d says Glover.\n\nShe adds that we all have limited resources\u2014limited time, limited energy\u2014and that putting \u201ctoo much\u201d toward a job will ensure you won\u2019t have a good work-life balance.\n\nAnd parsing that out is something that gets more and more difficult, Solomon says, as \u201cwork-life balance\u201d terminology itself can be deceiving.\n\n\u201cIn our minds, we have this belief that these are two separate spheres,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the boundary between home and work is actually quite permeable.\u201d\n\nMore on marriage and relationships:",

        "body": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.\n\nRecent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.\n\nAndresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.\n\n\u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An earnings limit means you do not qualify for carer\u2019s allowance if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week. Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy\n\nWith just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.\n\nCarer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.\n\nCarers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.\n\nThose who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nCarers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen A recent survey found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with the cost of living.

Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d\n\nStephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d\n\nAmong proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.\n\nWalker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d",

This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.\n\n\u201cFor example, if a student\u2019s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThis only applies to final-year students; students don\u2019t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.\u201d\n\nManchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.\n\nA spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: \u201cIt\u2019s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.\u201d\n\nCouncil tax bills are based on a property\u2019s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.\n\nAccording to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between \u00a368,001 and \u00a388,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be \u00a32,171 a year. This is about \u00a3181 a month \u2013 a lot when a third of students live off less than \u00a350.\n\nStudents who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.\n\nThere can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.\n\nStudents who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council\u2019s discretion.\n\nHowever, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.\n\nIt is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.",

The unemployment report has risen from a low of 3.2% post-pandemic to 4% as of last month.\n\nWhile the nonfarm payroll number is the business survey and thus more closely followed by investors, the unemployment rate matters greatly to politicians since that one single number can sum up the political environment in one single digit.\n\nThe Fed has gotten inflation down as low as it can, without labor market weakness dropping it further. The constant talk about rate cuts by the Fed will likely be just that \u2013 talk \u2013 until labor market weakness surfaces. Hard to say when that happens.\n\nThe fact is the economy remains in very good shape. The Core PCE data for May, reported this morning, fell to +2.6%, versus +2.8% last month. The Fed\u2019s almost there.\n\nS&P 500 data:\n\nThe forward 4-quarter estimate slipped a little this week to $252.85 from last week's $253.84.\n\nThe P/E ratio on the forward estimate is now 21.6x versus 21.55x last week.\n\nThe S&P 500 earnings yield slipped to 4.63% from last week's 4.64% even though the S&P 500 fell slightly on the week.\n\nWith this being the last week of reporting for Q1 \u201924, the S&P 500 EPS rose +8.2% (after bottoming at 5% on April 5th) while S&P 500 revenue rose +3.95%, after bottoming at 3% on April 5th, \u201924.\n\nExpect Q2 \u201924 revisions to be negative next week, but the strength in expected Q2 \u201924 EPS and revenue growth has been unusually solid at +10.6% expected EPS growth and +4.2% revenue growth.\n\nSummary/conclusion: The holiday shortened week will likely mean lean trading desks the morning of the nonfarm payroll report on July 5th, \u201924.\n\nHave a wonderful holiday weekend.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the dot.com bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the dot.com boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!\n\nMAV",

        "body": "The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night\u2019s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J.

        "body": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas on Friday temporarily blocked a Biden administration rule from taking effect that would extend mandatory overtime pay to 4 million salaried U.S. workers.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sean Jordan in Sherman, Texas, said the U.S. Department of Labor rule that is set to go into effect on Monday improperly bases eligibility for overtime pay on workers' wages rather than their job duties.\n\nJordan, an appointee of Republican former President Donald Trump, blocked the Labor Department from applying the rule to state workers in Texas pending the outcome of a legal challenge by the Republican-led state.\n\nThe Labor Department and the office of Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe department can seek review of the ruling in the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is widely regarded as the most conservative federal appeals court.\n\nThe rule adopted in April would require employers to pay overtime premiums to salaried workers who earn less than $1,128 per week, or about $58,600 per year, when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The current threshold of about $35,500 was set in 2019.\n\nFederal law exempts workers with \"executive, administrative, and professional\" (EAP) duties from receiving overtime pay, and the Labor Department has for decades used salary as one factor in deciding when that applies.\n\nIn adopting the rule, the department said that lower-paid salaried workers often do the same jobs as their hourly counterparts, but work more hours for no additional pay.\n\nThe rule also establishes automatic increases in the salary threshold every three years to reflect wage growth.\n\nTexas in its lawsuit said the rule violates federal law by conditioning overtime exemptions primarily on workers' pay rather than their duties, and is seeking to strike it down nationwide.\n\nTexas says that subjecting states to the overtime expansion violates their right under the U.S. Constitution to structure the pay of state employees and, in turn, decide how to allocate large portions of their budgets.\n\nJordan on Friday agreed that the Labor Department had overstepped its authority by effectively rewriting federal law.\n\n\"Since the ordinary meaning of the EAP Exemption focuses solely on duties, any rule implementing the EAP Exemption - including the 2024 Rule \u2014 must likewise center on duties,\" the judge wrote.\n\nJordan is also presiding over a challenge to the rule by business groups, and a small marketing firm is suing over the regulation in a different federal court in Texas.",

The motion was part of a class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs' lawyers opposed to the plan.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp on Friday said he could not grant the motion because any harm to the victims was \"strictly hypothetical.\" He said he had no jurisdiction to resolve a dispute over \"events that have not, and may never, occur.\"\n\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.\n\nJ&J hopes to garner support from 75% of claimants as part of the prepackaged bankruptcy plan. It has set a July 26 voting deadline.\n\nThe healthcare conglomerate faces lawsuits from more than 61,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc caused ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, a deadly cancer linked to asbestos exposure.\n\nJ&J maintains its talc is safe, asbestos-free and does not cause cancer. The company contends a bankruptcy settlement pays claimants fairly and equitably, as opposed to the civil justice system in which most plaintiffs receive nothing while some win outsized awards.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys opposing the plan say it is a fraudulent attempt to put billions of dollars of the company's assets out of plaintiffs' reach, preventing them from getting the compensation they deserve.\n\nJ&J has failed twice to execute a bankruptcy maneuver aimed at ending current and future talc lawsuits.\n\nThe strategy, known as a Texas two-step, involves creating a subsidiary to absorb J&J's talc liability, which then declares bankruptcy to resolve cases. Two courts previously found J&J's subsidiary lacked the \"financial distress\" necessary to legitimize a bankruptcy filing.\n\nJ&J's plan focuses on resolving claims in bankruptcy from women with ovarian and other gynecological cancers allegedly linked to talc. It has settled most mesothelioma cases outside of bankruptcy, and this month finalized a separate $700 million agreement to resolve claims from state attorneys general.",

Adept didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt Amazon, Luan and a number of others will report to Rohit Prasad, who oversees artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Others will join the team developing devices and other services, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters.\n\nPrasad, the former head of Alexa, who now reports directly to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, brought in researchers working on Alexa AI and the Amazon science team to work on training models, uniting AI efforts across the company with dedicated resources.\n\nPrasad said in the memo that the hires \"will significantly help us on our quest to achieving AGI.\"\n\nAdept also held discussions with other tech companies including Meta (NASDAQ: ), which decided not to pursue a tie-up or partnership, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Due to the recent drop, trading volumes have increased, suggesting that buyers are still very interested in the product at these reduced prices. Heightened activity typically signals an impending price reversal because it is an accumulation by investors anticipating gains in the future. Moving averages offer an additional level of understanding.\n\nThough these levels frequently serve as dynamic support and resistance zones, the chart indicates that Bitcoin is currently trading below the 100-day and 50-day exponential moving averages. A break above these moving averages on Bitcoin suggest a possible trend reversal and a move in the direction of bullish momentum.\n\nFor now, there is no distinctive fuel for the asset, and it is unlikely to appear in the foreseeable future, unless the ETF pushes the market forward as a whole.\n\ngets ready\n\nXRP is in the process of making another reversal attempt to break the descending trend that came after the prolonged sideways trend. We are aiming for the breakthrough of the 26 EMA and substantial stabilization and reversal. However, momentum is what is really needed right now.\n\nThe chart indicates that XRP has had difficulty keeping up its upward momentum and has continued failing to breach significant resistance levels. To suggest a possible trend reversal, XRP must cross above the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level has served as a barrier, and a successful breach might herald the start of a bullish phase.\n\nThe volume analysis reveals that traders have differing opinions, though. Trading volume has occasionally spiked but not consistently enough to allow for a long-term upward trend. Significantly higher buying volume is necessary for XRP to maintain its reversal attempt. This would give the market the momentum it needs to break through resistance levels and keep prices higher.\n\nXRP is presently in the neutral zone, according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI). There is potential for upward movement because this shows neither overbought nor oversold conditions.\n\naims higher\n\nDogecoin is going to test the $0.13 price threshold in the next few days, suggesting the current market composition. We are most likely going to see a test of the 200 EMA threshold and a subsequent breakthrough, if there is enough momentum.\n\nThe 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is represented by the $0.13 mark on the chart, which indicates that Dogecoin has been finding it difficult to break above significant resistance levels.\n\nA successful break above this level, which has historically been a major resistance point, might signal a bullish reversal. There may be cause for concern as volume analysis indicates that trading activity has been relatively muted. Dogecoin requires a sizable rise in purchasing volume to continue its upward trend.\n\nThe momentum needed to convincingly break through the 200 EMA may be hampered by a lack of consistently high trading volumes. The relative positions of the 100-day and 50-day EMAs are also noteworthy. At the moment, Dogecoin is trading below both of these moving averages, which typically denotes a downward trend.\n\nBut DOGE would be a very bullish indicator if it could muster enough buying pressure to break through these levels. Some additional information is offered by the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nThe fact that Dogecoin's RSI is currently circling the neutral zone indicates that there is still potential for upward movement without an overbuying situation. A move above the RSI's 50-point threshold would boost confidence in a possible bullish breakout.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today",

        "body": "By Parisa Hafezi\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) -A low-key moderate and a protege of Iran's supreme leader are neck-and-neck in the vote count in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and social restrictions.\n\nMore than 14 million votes have been counted so far from Friday's vote, of which the sole moderate candidate Massoud Pezeshkian had won over 5.9 million votes and his hardline challenger former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili over 5.5 million, provisional results by the interior ministry showed.\n\nSome insiders said the turnout was around 40%, lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers, while witnesses told Reuters that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities were not crowded.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was \"very likely\" to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nThe election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWhile the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic Republic's policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.\n\nThe clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nPezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nLIMITED CHOICES\n\nThe election was a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low-profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the U.S. ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nDIVIDED VOTERS\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.",

They should free them now for what they have gone through\" Trump said, as the crowd cheered.\n\n\"They've been waiting for this decision for a long time,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to throw out a lower court's decision that had allowed a charge of corruptly obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of Biden's 2020 victory over Trump that the rioters sought to prevent - against defendant Joseph Fischer, a former police officer. The justices directed the lower court to reconsider the matter.\n\nThe ruling was a potential boost for Trump, who was hit with two obstruction-related charges as part of a four-count criminal indictment in a case brought last year by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\n\"That is a great thing for people that have been so horribly treated,\" Trump said of the ruling.\n\nTrump has often valorized his supporters convicted for their roles in the attack on the Capitol, calling them \"patriots\" and \"warriors.\" Among other crimes, some of them were prosecuted for violence against police officers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday is expected to issue its ruling in Trump's claim of presidential immunity from prosecution in the election subversion case brought by the special counsel.

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\" \"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \"disastrous\" prospect.\" \"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\" said Bose. \"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\" she added.\n\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\" Bose said. \"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \"event of death, resignation or disability\" that leaves the role vacant.\n\nwatch now",

Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

Navarro will soon complete serving his sentence.\n\nAn attorney for Bannon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the Supreme Court's order.\n\nBannon was convicted in July 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress after a trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. His jail sentence was stayed in October 2022 pending an appeal of his conviction.\n\nLast month, a three-judge federal appeals court panel upheld his conviction, rejecting an argument that Bannon did not break the law because his attorney had advised him not to comply with the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena because of the chance his testimony could be blocked by a claim of executive privilege.\n\nBannon is expected to ask the full appeals court in Washington, D.C., to rehear the appeal of his conviction. But the district judge in his case, Carl Nichols, on June 6 ordered him to report to jail to begin his sentence.\n\nLast week, Bannon asked the Supreme Court to suspend his surrender date pending his appeal. Friday's order by the high court rejected that bid, making it all but certain that Bannon will serve his sentence before his appeals are exhausted.\n\nThe bipartisan House panel was formed to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection, when a violent mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and forced Congress to delay certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nThe committee set its sights on Bannon in light of reporting that on Jan. 5, 2021, he had predicted that \"all hell is going to break loose\" the following day, and that he was involved in talks about how to overturn the election results.",

        "body": "Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.\n\nTractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.\n\nThe retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.\n\nTractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.\n\nTractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.\n\n\"Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,\" Tractor Supply said in the news release. \"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.\"\n\nTractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.\n\nThe retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion.

        "body": "An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.\n\nFord Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\nFarley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford \"skunkworks\" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .\n\nFarley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are \"never going to make money.\"\n\n\"You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,\" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. \"That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. \u2026 The batteries will never be affordable.\"\n\nA Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.\n\nFord earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed \"T3,\" from late 2025 to 2026.\n\nFarley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.\n\nHe also said Americans need to \"get back in love\" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.\n\n\"We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,\" Farley said Friday. \"We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.\"\n\nFord's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.\n\nFarley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.\n\n\"If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,\" he said. \"And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.\"",

        "body": "Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch \u2014 an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets: Wall Street is ending the final day of the second quarter on a muted note, even after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed a further cooling off in May . The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were flat in afternoon trading. The indexes, which are trying for a fourth consecutive day of gains, began the day higher. After minor advances Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, weighed down, in part, by Nike 's ugly earnings report. The sneaker company's shares fell 20%. Quarter end : The Dow is on track for a losing second quarter, down nearly 2% over the three-month timeframe. The 30-stock Dow had advanced in back-to-back quarters. Meanwhile, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are up about 4% and 9%, respectively, in the April-to-June period. That will be the third straight positive quarter for the indexes and the fifth over the past six. Investor optimism around artificial intelligence stocks once again took center stage in the second quarter. It fueled huge gains for the likes of Club names Nvidia , Apple and Broadcom , even when factoring in the recent for volatility for some AI winners. Disney on radar: Shares of Club name Disney dropped 3% on Friday, breaching the $100 level that Jim Cramer has in recent weeks identified as a favorable price to buy more stock. \"I am contemplating buying back some of the Disney we sold much higher when we are [not restricted] sometime next week,\" Jim said Friday. Jim's comments come as Wall Street is surveying the implications of Thursday night's presidential debate , which was widely seen as strengthening former President Donald Trump's chances of recapturing the White House in November. \"I know people might think that Disney is too 'woke' under a Trump regime, but I care more about how there could be a lot of M & A in media and Disney could benefit,\" he said. Future of the Fed: Cramer has been a vocal supporter of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the job he's been doing. However, he said Friday: \"Before you get too excited, remember, Powell is one of the first people to go. Trump has disliked him intensely even know he's his guy.\" Powell became Fed chairman in 2018 during the Trump presidency. But Trump almost immediately turned on Powell, lashing out at him in the fall of 2018 when the U.S. central bank started raising interest rates. His criticism continued during the final two years of his presidency . With much of the stock market discussion centered around what the Fed may or may not do, a change in Fed chair under Trump would likely shape rate policy in a different light. Solar praise: Analysts at Susquehanna offered upbeat commentary Friday on our newest stock: Nextracker , which joined the portfolio a day earlier . The firm initiated coverage of the maker of solar-tracking systems with a $59 price target and a buy-equivalent rating. While analysts were also positive on Nextracker competitor Array , they told clients they view the Club holding as a \"safer pick due to its leading market share, greater exposure to Tier 1 suppliers, geographic diversity, and cash generation.\" Nextracker shares traded around $47 each Friday, down more than 4% as the broader solar cohort came under pressure. The debate Thursday may be one driver of the selling. Trump is considered more favorable to the oil-and-gas industry, while President Joe Biden has championed clean-energy policies. Jim on Friday downplayed concerns that Nextracker would struggle in a hypothetical second Trump term. \"That's quite wrong,\" he said. \"Nextracker is industrial solar. Now, who wants industrial solar? The big mega caps \u2014 Microsoft and Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 because they are levered to commitments that they gave, not anything having to do with the president, for being carbon free, or at least reducing their [carbon] footprint.\" Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon also are Club holdings. As usual, we started with a small stake in Nextracker, at just a 0.5% weighting, which gives us room to add more shares over time. Our price target is $55 a share. Up next: On Friday evening, our two bank stocks, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley , may provide updated capital return programs after passing the Fed's annual stress tests earlier this week.

        "title": "How some venture capitalists are trying to lift the profile of LGBTQ+ founders",
        "body": "Raising capital remains an enduring obstacle for LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. Some venture capitalists are trying to change the equation and are backing minority founders to help them scale their companies and create jobs within their communities.\n\nAccording to LGBTQ+ entrepreneurship nonprofit StartOut, only 0.5% of the $2.1 trillion in startup funding between 2020 and 2022 was raised by LGBTQ+ founders, yet 7.2% of the U.S. population identifies as a member of the community, according to a 2022 Gallup survey.\n\nStartOut's State of LGBTQ+ Entrepreneurship Report, which aggregates data from internal research and sources like Crunchbase and Pitchbook, also found that 85% of funding is accumulated in only five metro areas: San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Denver and Austin, Texas. The largest cities that lack any LGBTQ+ founders are Orlando, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nStartOut CEO Brian Richardson told CNBC that jurisdictions with comprehensive nondiscrimination policies protecting LGBTQ+ people are the cities that have stronger benches of queer entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What we've been able to do through the limited datasets that we have is to start looking at and measuring how much cities and even states are losing out monetarily and employment-wise because they have anti-LGBTQ+ policies in place,\" Richardson said.\n\nResearchers at StartOut have examined the varying geographic impacts, weighing the economic effects that public policies have on entrepreneurial outcomes by comparing states that did and didn't pass the LGBTQ+-affirming policies between 2010 through 2020. They found that implementing state employee benefits coverage for transition-related care in Texas could create more than 121,000 jobs. Additionally, implementing hate crime laws for gender identity in North Carolina could attract as many as 17,000 founders, while a repeal of so-called \"Don't Say Gay or Trans\" laws in Alabama could add $10 billion in funding, they said.\n\n\"These numbers are really just the very first step of a much longer process to identify the challenges and to find the very best, most comprehensive, most effective solutions,\" Richardson said.\n\nOne organization trying such solutions is Chasing Rainbows, a venture capital fund that works with LGBTQ+ founders to connect them with capital. The fund currently invests in around 15 early-stage companies.\n\n\"We usually write [the] first checks for a lot of the companies, particularly from an institutional perspective,\" Ben Stokes, founding partner of Chasing Rainbows, told CNBC. \"We are very open to having conversations if someone doesn't have revenue; it's really just understanding the pathway that they have to get to that.\"\n\nChasing Rainbows takes a sector agnostic approach but focuses on four opportunity zones when considering a startup: sustainability, health care, education, and financial equity and inclusion. Stokes said the LGBTQ+ community historically has experienced some form of discrimination when trying to access these types of services.\n\n\"When a founder has experienced a problem themselves, they often know how to fix it,\" Stokes said. \"And they have creative solutions that are often done in a very financially savvy way.\"\n\nStartOut's report also found that despite operating on 16% less funding compared to the industry average, LGBTQ+ founders created 36% more jobs, 114% more patents and 44% more exits between 2000 to 2022.\n\n\"We work together to ensure that we are investing in new companies, that we believe that not only venture backers will [invest in] but will offer and deliver outsized returns for our investors,\" Stokes said.\n\nStokes said Chasing Rainbows advocates for resource allocations to consider founder diversity when selecting investments. State-level initiatives are already underway in Massachusetts and New York that would require VCs to include sexual orientation when considering capital allocation.\n\nIn California, Senate Bill No. 54 will require venture firms to report diversity statistics within their portfolios. That includes race, ethnicity, gender identity, veteran status, disability status and whether any member of the founding team identifies as LGBTQ+. The bill is scheduled to go into effect on March 1, 2025.\n\n\"This is going to be an amazing wake-up call for the industry,\" Stokes said, \"and particularly for limited partners, who are going in on the premise of the lead investors investing in diverse teams. Is it actually true?\"\n\nAn angel investor himself, Stokes founded Chasing Rainbows in 2021 after recognizing that underrepresented founders are seen as riskier investments. He credited his law professor at the University of California at Berkeley for giving him advice that led to his fund's approach.\n\n\"He said, 'Don't just be another underrepresented funder investing in underrepresented founders; be unique and be special in the industry because that's the only thing that's going to make you successful,'\" Stokes said.\n\nOn top of the limited amount of funding being funneled to LGBTQ+ innovators, Stokes said 75% of founders go back \"into the closet\" while fundraising on concern that being part of the community would taint their brand.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this has been evidenced by the fact that general partners and other funds who do have different religious or political views have openly discriminated against someone based on their sexuality,\" he said. \"What that means for them is that they're often code switching,\" referring to the practice of LGBTQ+ people deviating to more heteronormative language and behaviors.\n\n\"They will be scrubbing their LinkedIn, scrubbing all of their social media profiles,\" Stokes said, \"essentially going back into the closet and not being their authentic selves.\"\n\nBoth Stokes and Richardson were invited to the White House this past week to participate in a roundtable discussion on the hurdles that entrepreneurs face.\n\n\"Some of the challenges are obvious \u2014 access to capital is the biggest one,\" Stokes said. \"But we're looking at ways to partner with the government, in particular around grants and non-dilutive capital.\"\n\nRichardson hopes the attention will lead to broader support for organizations like Chasing Rainbows, and that additional funding for data and research will lead to greater representation and expanded economic opportunities for underrepresented innovators.\n\n\"We know that queer people and queer entrepreneurs continue to face barriers,\" Richardson said. \"But we also know that those barriers are especially steep for specific members of our community. We want to figure out and identify just how steep the barriers are and what individual members in our community continue to face.\"",

Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nOfficials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico \u2014 testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.\n\n\"We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,\" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.\n\nBefore launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.\n\nDespite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,\" Stich said.\n\nThe Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.

Jason Armond | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nConsumers aren't sacrificing dining out, even with prices on the rise \u2014 but they are getting more savvy about managing those bills. The majority of Americans surveyed, 81%, say they are dining out once a month or more and 31% say they dine out once a week or more, according to new research from e-commerce provider Lightspeed Commerce Inc . Even though inflation has slowed significantly from its pandemic-era peak, consumers still feeling the financial squeeze are opting for takeout, value meals and happy hour deals, the report found. The consumer price index, which gauges how fast prices are changing in the U.S. economy, shows food prices at restaurants have been growing faster than grocery store items \u2014 but finance experts have tips for stretching your dollar.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"While Americans are still dining out, they are also looking for ways to keep dining fun and affordable amidst changing economic conditions. It's all about value for diners \u2014 they're looking to enjoy eating out, but at a good price,\" Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva said. Lightspeed surveyed 1,500 Americans in May as part of an international survey that included 7,500 overall responses.\n\nHigher meal prices and 'shrinkflation'\n\nU.S. diners are noticing rising prices when the server drops off their bill, with 69% in the Lightspeed survey reporting pricier meals. Some said they're seeing \"shrinkflation\" in action, with 39% noticing their favorite dishes shrinking in size even as the prices remain the same or increase. Even with a jump in prices, about half of respondents said they will continue to dine out at the same rate or increase their frequency of restaurant visits. Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and CEO of oXYGen Financial Inc. in Atlanta, said consumer dining trends could be a lingering effect from the aftermath of the pandemic. More from Personal Finance:\n\nHere's why your July 4th barbecue may be pricier this year\n\nBiden's new student loan relief plan is on pause. What to know\n\nHomeowners typically spend nearly $55,000 to sell a home \"It started with revenge travel, and then it was followed by revenge shopping. And now I think it's just a way that people are living their life with this mentality of 'I'm going to just enjoy my life today, because I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring me,'\" said Jenkin, who is a member of the CNBC Advisor Council. \"And I think there's been some permanency to that.\" Nearly half of U.S. diners, 45%, are being more frugal by asking for to-go boxes to enjoy leftovers later, according to Lightspeed. Meanwhile, 43% are hunting for deals with coupons, 39% are choosing value meals and 36% are taking advantage of happy hour specials.\n\nPast the 'tipping point of tipping'\n\nOne way consumers say inflation is impacting their dining habits is through tipping. Of those surveyed, 44% of consumers said inflation has affected their ability to tip. The majority of diners surveyed, 73%, say they're not happy when the cashier flips around a tablet screen to reveal auto-tipping options. \"I think when times were better, you definitely saw more people being more comfortable at the iPad paying tip,\" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Irvine, California-based Sun Group Wealth Partners. She is also a member of the CNBC Advisor Council. \"Nowadays, consumers are fed up with having to tip at places that they don't normally tip at,\" she added.\n\nWhen looking at scenarios outside of sit-down restaurants, consumers are more likely to tip delivery drivers (61%), than baristas at coffee shops (28%) or an employee working behind a counter (19%). \"People have passed the tipping point of tipping. I think people are willing to tip when they go out to a real service-based restaurant,\" Jenkin said. \"The days of going in and having to pay for a $7 coffee and leaving a $2 tip are, I think, are getting smaller and smaller as consumers are feeling the bite at their wallet.\"\n\nWays to spend wisely while dining out",

        "body": "A seller is arranging onions at a vegetable market in Nagaon district, in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on February 1, 2024.\n\nThis report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nA curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.\n\nSo, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.\n\nAnd it has been for the past year.\n\nThe price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.\n\nPoor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.\n\nTemperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.\n\nFood prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.\n\n\"The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,\" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. \"Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,\" he added.\n\nKeeping rates elevated, though, appears to be \"an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,\" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.\n\nThe anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.\n\n\"Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,\" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.\n\nThe government also has the option to remove import taxes \u2014 currently set at 40% on wheat \u2014 to hold prices down.\n\nYet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.\n\nLowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.\n\nFor now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.\n\nThere are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.\n\nBut, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.\n\n\"You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,\" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. \"[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.\"\n\n\"That's just the norm,\" he added.",

Some economists have warned that if either were to form a majority and quickly push through the majority of their proposals, it could tip over into a debt crisis.\n\nBoth parties are seen outperforming the centrist coalition containing President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party in Sunday's first-round vote. However, the path from there looks deeply uncertain.\n\nA benign outcome from a market perspective could involve the centrists finding some path to victory, or a hung parliament in which no party can progress with their agenda.\n\nCiti performed a scenario analysis of different outcomes and what they could mean for Paris's CAC 40 stock market index \u2014 also based on potential movements in the spread between French and German bond yields, which hit a 12-year high Friday.\n\n\"The outcome is still quite unclear, we only have polling for the first round of the election. So we'll know much more on Sunday evening,\" Manthey said.\n\n\"Let's put the announcement of the election in the context of the positioning of the investors. Europe has been a very popular market, has been outperforming, international investors have been shifting away from the U.S. to Europe, positioning has been stretched or net long, extended long, especially on the European banks. And that has all unwound now to neutral, but it's not negative,\" she said.\n\nEuropean stocks are trading close to a 40% discount to the U.S., a \"huge\" gap compared with a historical average of around 15% to 20%, she said.\n\n\"But valuations need a trigger. The increased political risks are not a trigger, that's what I worry about. ... Our model suggests right now, it's fairly priced for what the analysts expect on the fundamentals front,\" she continued.\n\n\"Let's put it this way, we've downgraded Europe, upgraded the U.S., on the back of increased political risks. European, within developed markets, equities tend to be the most vulnerable to these changes,\" she added.\n\nIf the French election outcome \"is very market unfriendly ... markets in Europe are quite correlated.

        "body": "Learning how to harness our attention is the \"skill of the century,\" says behavioral design expert Nir Eyal. D3sign | Moment | Getty Images\n\nInformation overload. From music and games to social media and endless hours of entertainment, easy access to technology has meant that humans are perpetually distracted. \"The cost of living in a world with so much abundance, the price of progress, is that we have to learn how to deal with all this information,\" according to Nir Eyal, best-selling author of \"Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life.\" \"The skill of the century is being able to harness your attention,\" Eyal, an expert in behavioral design, told CNBC Make It. \"It doesn't matter that you have the world's information at your fingertips ... if you can't sit down and focus on it long enough to actually turn that information to wisdom, then it might as well be garbage.\" Technology can be useful to humanity, but it can also be a distraction and lead to procrastination. In a world where technology is advancing at a breakneck pace, here are 4 principles to follow in order to become \"indistractable,\" according to Eyal.\n\nMaster your internal triggers\n\nWhen people feel bored, they check Instagram. When they're uncertain, they check Google. The action of being distracted is often preceded by a feeling of discomfort, or an \"internal trigger,\" says Eyal. To stay focused, people should first identify the feeling that precedes the distraction and create a plan of action for the next time that feeling comes knocking. People tend to blame their devices for distracting them from the task at hand, but studies show that humans are checking their phones due to a \"ping, ding or ring\" for only 10% of the time, said Eyal. The other 90% of the time, they are checking their devices due to an internal feeling \u2014 or to avoid pain or discomfort. Ultimately, devices are tools that carry no moral distinction. They are neither good, nor bad, but they can be used in productive or counterproductive ways. It is therefore important to learn how to harness the power of technology to serve us, instead of blaming it for distracting us from work and life.\n\nMake time for tasks\n\nIt is crucial to make time to perform the tasks at hand. \"If you don't have time for exercise, time with your family, time with your friends, time for focused work, it's not going to get done,\" Eyal told CNBC Make It. \"I used to believe [in] this to-do list myth,\" said Eyal, but this is \"one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity.\" While these lists provide the opportunity to unscramble thoughts and put goals on paper, it doesn't create the constraint that's necessary for prolonged productivity and focus. This method of planning is \"harmful,\" said Eyal, because without intentionally designating the time to perform the task, it can often end up taking longer than expected \u2014 or worse, set people up for failure. Instead, he suggests using a \"timebox calendar.\" It's a technique where instead of working on a task until it is complete, you set a fixed amount of time in your calendar for a particular task, according to Spica International, a workforce management software solution company. For example, a timebox calendar can look like this: 7-9 a.m. \u2014 Focused working time\n\n9-10 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast and get ready for the day\n\n10 a.m.-12 p.m. \u2014 Reply to emails and miscellaneous work\n\n12 -1 p.m. \u2014 Lunch\n\n1-3 p.m. \u2014 Work meetings\n\n3-5 p.m. \u2014 Focused work time\n\n5-6 p.m. \u2014 Reply to emails and plan for tomorrow\n\n6-7 p.m. \u2014 Exercise\n\n7-9 p.m. \u2014 Dinner and family time With a timebox calendar, \"the goal is not to finish anything, the goal is to work on a task without distraction,\" said Eyal. Not only does this help prevent procrastination, it can also prevent burnout by creating the dedicated time for other activities. It can help people prioritize their relationships, maintain their health, and overall, lead a more balanced life.\n\n'Hack back' the external triggers\n\nWhile people have become very reliant on devices, \"being dependent is not the same thing as being addicted,\" wrote Eyal in his book. Eyal suggested \"hacking back\" the external triggers on our devices, which is very quick and easy to do. They include purging apps that don't serve you, disabling notifications, as well as wearing a watch instead of looking at your phone to check the time. \"What's much more important that people don't talk about, are the meetings that didn't need to be called [and] the emails that didn't need to be sent,\" he added. Becoming pickier and more thoughtful with how we work can help prevent unnecessary time wasted.\n\nMake a pact",

        "title": "Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness",
        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.\n\n\"While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,\" Barr said. \"The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.\"\n\nThe Fed also performed what it called an \"exploratory analysis\" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.\n\nIn this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.\n\n\"The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,\" the Fed said.\n\nBanks are expected to begin announcing their latest share repurchase plans on Friday.",

While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\" McMillan told CNBC. \"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\"\n\nConsent required\n\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\n\n\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \"grand experiment in productivity,\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\" with clients, said McMillan. \"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\"\n\nThe broader vision",

        "title": "Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more",
        "body": "How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.\n\nVanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.\n\nThe good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.\n\nThe bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.\n\nThe takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.\n\nHigher returns, participation rates, savings rates\n\nWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.\n\nFirst, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.\n\nBut to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.\n\nOn those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"\n\nPlan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.\n\nThe result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.\n\nParticipant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.\n\nA few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:\n\nThey prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.\n\nThey don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. \"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.\n\nDespite gains in the market, account balances are still low\n\nIn 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.\n\nWhy such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.\n\nDistribution of account balances\n\nLess than $20,000 40%\n\n$20,000-$99,999 30%\n\n$100,000-$249,900 15%\n\n$250,000 + 15%\n\nSource: Vanguard\n\nMedian balances for those near retirement are still low\n\nA different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.\n\nInvestors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.\n\nA median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.\n\nOf course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.\n\nRegardless, the math does not look great\n\nSo let's do some retirement math.\n\nA typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.\n\nNext, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.\n\nFinally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.\n\nAccording to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).\n\nHere's our yearly retirement budget:\n\nPersonal savings $3,539\n\nPension $9,262\n\nSocial Security $20,264\n\nTotal: $33,065\n\nIt's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.\n\nEven then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.\n\nAnd these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.\n\nAnd that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.\n\nIn 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTo have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.\n\nOne issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.\n\nHowever, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.\n\nRegardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.",

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\n\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"",

        "body": "A bank employee count China\u2019s renminbi (RMB) or yuan notes next to U.S. dollar notes at a Kasikornbank in Bangkok, Thailand, January 26, 2023. Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters\n\nDALIAN, China \u2014 For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more \"applications\" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan \u2014 also known as the \"renminbi\" or \"RMB\" \u2014 in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's \"Summer Davos\" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. \"We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,\" she said. \"You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc.\" \"One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,\" Chan said, \"so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the HKEX announced a \"Dual-Counter\" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, \"we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,\" Hu said. \"Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.\"\n\nA maturing financial market\n\nDeveloping more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term \"patient investing.\" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. \"Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,\" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.\n\nWaiting for more Chinese IPOs",

        "body": "Shapecharge | E+ | Getty Images\n\nWhy life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen\n\nMany Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has \"steadily\" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. \"It's a complex transaction,\" he said.\n\nThere are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, \"I do think there's a need for it,\" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.\n\nWhen to buy life insurance\n\nSupersizer | E+ | Getty Images\n\nConsumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. \"Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?\" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.\n\nWhat type of life insurance to buy\n\nThere are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.\n\nIt's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG\n\nIf a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires \u2014 perhaps at age 65 \u2014 the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.\n\nHow much life insurance to get\n\nLuca Sage | Digitalvision | Getty Images",

She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.\n\nThe pool began leaking air after just a few uses.\n\nFor Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool \u2014 and the disappointment that came with it \u2014 helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.\n\nAs Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.\n\nSam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.\n\n\"The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,\" he said in an interview. \"Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.\"\n\nThe success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.\n\nOvertaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"Never say never,\" he said. \"Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.\"\n\nBut he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.\n\nThe popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals.

The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\n\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \"high teens.\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \"R2\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware.

That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\"'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\" but \"that is not the case,\" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \"the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\"\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\" Wentworth said. \"What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.\"\n\nHere's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\n63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nChinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.\n\nAlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. \"China is the industry's new disruptor \u2013 capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,\" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .\n\nModels presenting the Chinese automaker's electric car, the BYD Song MAX, at the 45th Bangkok International Motor Show 2024 in Nonthaburi Province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, on March 30, 2024.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters\n\nNASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called \"U.S. Deorbit Vehicle.\" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. \"It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,\" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to \"ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.\"\n\nSpaceX's Dragon crew capsule \"Endeavour\" seen from the International Space Station on May 2, 2024. NASA\n\nNASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. \u2013 along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan \u2013 has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.\n\nAging ISS\n\nBut the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. \"The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,\" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.",

        "body": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .\n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.\n\nLevi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\n\n16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.\n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.\n\n\"People are generally cautious,\" Singh told CNBC in an interview. \"It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\"\n\nWhile Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.\n\nLevi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.\n\n\"In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\" the company said.\n\nThe change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\"Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \"conservative\" view of the channel's growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.\n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.\n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.\n\nFor a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.\n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \"corrected\" that.\n\nRead the full earnings release here.",

        "title": "YouTube dominates streaming, forcing media companies to decide whether it's friend or foe",
        "body": "In this article GOOGL\n\nNFLX\n\nWBD\n\nDIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May \u2014 the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly \"The Gauge\" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. \"We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,\" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. \"Every [media] executive has to be paying attention.\" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV \u2014 an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others \u2014 even at times the same executives \u2014 view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube \"every day\" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. \"I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,\" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. \"When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,\" she said.\n\nYouTube's growing dominance\n\nGoogle's Tara Walpert Levy, now YouTube's vice president of Americas, speaks during a 2016 Advertising Week New York event, Sept. 28, 2016. John Lamparski | Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company \u2014 more than Disney and Comcast combined. \"YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,\" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.\n\nDisney's YouTube focus\n\nDisney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's \"The Gauge\" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.\n\nYou're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\" Brittany Broski YouTube creator\n\n\"I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,\" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as \"Bluey,\" \"Spidey and his Amazing Friends\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\"\n\nCartoon characters from the children's show \"Bluey\" are displayed during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 4, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\n\"At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,\" said Mayer. \"We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have.\" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series \"Disney Junior's Ariel,\" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of \"Winnie the Pooh\" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on \"Winnie the Pooh\" based on the short-form video data, the person said.\n\nNetflix's muted response\n\nNetflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. \"We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,\" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. \"Cocomelon,\" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. \"Cocomelon\" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and \"many more if you add in all languages,\" Mayer said. At the same time, \"Cocomelon\" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.\n\nPosters showing \"Blippi\" and \"Cocomelon\" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images\n\nThe more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.\n\nOther strategies\n\nComcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, scenes from \"The Office\" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a \"YouTube 1.0 strategy\" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. \"I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,\" said Nathanson. \"The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0.\" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack \u2014 pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, \"Beast Games,\" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a \"fast-paced and high-production format,\" as Amazon has promised.\n\nMrBeast accepts the Favorite Male Creator award onstage during the 2023 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, March 4, 2023. Monica Schipper | Getty Images\n\nMrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.\n\nYouTube's community\n\nThe popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. \"I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,\" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. \"You're betraying your audience,\" said Broski. \"You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\"\n\nBrittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nThe business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. \"Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?\" Broski said. \"You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?\" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. \"In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,\" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. \"With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.\"\n\nMichelle Khare at The 2023 Streamy Awards in Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2023.

        "body": "In this article MANU Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Boeing 767 passenger aircraft of Delta Air Lines arrives from Dublin at JFK International Airport in New York as the Manhattan skyline looms in the background on Feb. 7, 2024. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty Images\n\nDelta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines \u2014 second to Delta in net profit margins \u2014 is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. \"Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,\" Bastian told CNBC.\n\nEd Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2022. Bastian said that he sees 'strong demand' for flights carrying into 2023. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDelta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. \"The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,\" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. \"We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. \"If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for.\" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead \u2014 if not drive \u2014 shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is \"part art\" and \"part science,\" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. \"Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,\" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards FactSet\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. \"They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,\" he said. \"And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nWhen the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. \"It was about building the operation brick by brick,\" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. \"It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand.\" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. \"One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,\" said Anderson. \"If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home.\" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. \"They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,\" he said. \"They have time to serve rather than to apologize.\" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.\n\nTime to remodel\n\nAfter Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. \"You had the liberty to start investing in premium,\" he said. \"You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers.\" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. \"I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,\" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. \"I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things.\" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.\n\nwatch now\n\nDelta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (\"It's proprietary,\" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, \"I must be in some third-world country.\" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a \"juniority benefit.\" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.\n\nLuxury air travel? In the U.S.?\n\nLuxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years \u2014 and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. \"Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,\" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year \u2014 which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate \u2014 after an uproar from customers.\n\n'We're constantly pushing each other\"\n\nBoth Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. \"Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.\n\nwatch now",

Vehicle inventory levels are growing, incentives are increasing and there's growing uncertainty surrounding the economy, interest rates and U.S. presidential election, according to Cox Automotive. The auto data and research firm expects sales growth to slow in the next six months to 15.7 million units, roughly a 1.3% increase from 2023. And, unlike in recent years, growth is coming from commercial sales rather than more profitable consumer sales. \"Overall, we're expecting some weakness in the coming few months,\" said Cox chief economist Jonathan Smoke during a midyear review briefing Tuesday. \"We basically are making some assumptions that we can't quite hold the pace that we've been seeing. But we're not expecting a collapse either.\"\n\nGood for consumers\n\nSuch circumstances are largely good for consumers, some of whom have been waiting years to purchase a new vehicle amid unprecedented supplies of new vehicles and record prices during the coronavirus pandemic. But those circumstances are a headwind for automakers, many of which posted record profits due to the high demand and low availability of new vehicles during the global health crisis.

        "body": "Home prices set another record in April, even as mortgage rates rose and the supply of homes for sale increased. Usually, under those circumstances, prices would weaken, but today's housing market is unlike any other in recent history.\n\nPrices in April rose 6.3% compared with the year-earlier month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. It marks the second straight month that the national index jumped at least 1% over its previous all-time high.\n\nAlthough this is a three-month moving average, it's important to note that those price gains come even as the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped sharply in April, from 6.9% to 7.5%, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\n\"2024 is closely tracking the strong start observed last year, where March and April posted the largest rise seen prior to a slowdown in the summer and fall,\" said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a news release. \"Heading into summer, the market is at an all-time high, once again testing its resilience against the historically more active time of the year.\"\n\nThe only potential sign of relief is that the annual and monthly gains on the price index are slowing a little bit. March's annual gain was 6.5%.\n\nStill, it feeds into what is now one of the least affordable housing markets in U.S. history for both homeownership and renting. The housing cost burden has hit a record, according to a new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nHome prices are now 47% higher than they were in early 2020, with the median sale price now five times the median household income, according to the study.\n\nFor renters, even though rent growth is slowing due to a big increase in new apartment units this year, prices are still 26% higher than they were in 2020 and rising in three out of every five markets.\n\nHalf of all renter households \u2014 more than 22 million \u2014 spent more than 30% of their income on housing, which is considered \"cost burdened\" by HJCH. Twelve million of those households spend more than half their income on rent.\n\nFor homeowners, 20 million are considered cost burdened by their monthly payments.\n\nAll of those cost-burdened levels represent records.\n\nHomeowners are also facing a sharp increase in insurance premiums, up an average 21% between 2022 and 2023, according to the HJCH report, and property taxes are also rising.\n\nPrices continue to be supported by an imbalance in supply and demand. Housing supply was already low before the Covid pandemic hit, because homebuilders had yet to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Then there was a pandemic-induced run on housing, causing supply to drop to record lows for several years. Homebuilders couldn't keep up.\n\nSupply is now rising, with an 11% increase in new listings in April from March, according to Zillow, and a 16% increase from April 2023. That pushed total for-sale inventory up 18% year over year. While that might sound like a lot, supply is still quite lean, especially compared with the strong demand.\n\n\"The rapid and sudden increase in mortgage rates in April pushed housing affordability further out of reach for many potential buyers while some who could still afford held back,\" said Zillow's senior economist Orphe Divounguy in a release. \"As a result, the share of listings with a price cut shot up to 22.4% in April, the highest rate for April in the past six years, and a significant step up from 17.2% a year earlier.\"\n\nBut he added that despite the relative slowdown in April sales, homes that were priced well sold in just 13 days, only three days slower than in April 2023.\n\nIn May, inventory rose to a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.",
        "summary": "Home prices set another record in April, even as mortgage rates rose and the supply of homes for sale increased.\nUsually, under those circumstances, prices would weaken, but today's housing market is unlike any other in recent history.\nThe housing cost burden has hit a record, according to a new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\nHousing supply was already low before the Covid pandemic hit, because homebuilders had yet to recover from the 2008 financial crisis.\nThen there was a pandemic-induced run on housing, causing supply to drop to record lows for several years.",

He then worked at Amazon as vice president of entertainment devices and services before his most recent role as chief product and technology officer for software development company Unity's Create.\n\nHis appointment comes at a crucial time for Cruise, which is testing and relaunching its autonomous vehicles on public roadways. It ceased operations weeks after an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi.\n\nFollowing the incident, several key leaders, including Cruise CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, departed the company.\n\n\"Marc is a proven technology and business leader with extensive experience in scaling products and building ecosystems around them,\" GM CEO and Chair Mary Barra, who also leads the Cruise board of directors, said in a release. \"He has sparked innovation and driven growth in complex, fast-paced environments throughout his career, and I believe that will prove crucial to Cruise's vision of creating technology that provides real, tangible benefits to society.\"\n\nA third-party probe into the October incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that led to the accident.

Leslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nDelta Air Lines' most exclusive airport lounge opened this week to travelers flying on the right ticket. The Delta One lounge at the carrier's hub at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is available to customers departing or arriving in the Delta One cabin, the airline's highest tier of service. It's the latest effort by a U.S. airline to win over top-paying customers. CNBC got a peek inside before opening day. The more than 39,000-square-foot space features a high-end, sit-down restaurant, as well as a quick-bite bakery and walk-up food counter. It also features a full bar and a terrace overlooking the airfield.\n\nLeslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nThe lounge, Delta's largest, is a step up from its more accessible Sky Club lounges, with new areas to relax. Travelers are offered complimentary spa treatments for the eyes, hands and arms and what it calls \"recovery remedy,\" a 10-minute shoulder, scalp and temple massage. There are eight shower suites complete with robes and slippers, and travelers can leave their clothes out to be steamed by staff within minutes, Delta says.\n\nAmenities in bathroom and shower stall at Delta One lounge at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Leslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nFor travelers who want to continue to work, the space includes eight soundproof booths. In total, the lounge seats 515 people.\n\nLeslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nDelta is taking a page from the playbooks of American Airlines and United Airlines , which already offer dedicated lounges for travelers in their long-haul business or first-class cabins, but the carrier hopes the new amenities will attract more flyers to its Delta One cabin.\n\nDelta One lounge's dining area at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport Leslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nDelta last year said the average age of its SkyMiles members has dropped from 44 in 2017 to 39 in 2022, and the carrier wants to capture travelers' loyalty early. \"It's important to note that not every new member starts out as a Million Miler,\" Dwight James, Delta's senior vice president of customer engagement and loyalty, said in an interview. \"This notion of premium that we talk about is also aspirational.\" James declined to say how much Delta is investing in the lounge.\n\nBar at Delta One lounge at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Leslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nDelta has struggled with overcrowding at some of its other Sky Clubs, even long lines to get in to some of them. Last year, it unveiled more restrictive entry requirements, only to walk some of them back weeks later after a customer uproar. \"I feel really confident that the line issue will be addressed once this lounge opens,\" James said. In addition to travelers on Delta One tickets, the lounge will also be open to travelers with the secretive, invite-only \"360\" status Delta hands out to a select few. Travelers on Delta's partner airlines' equivalent cabins will also have access.\n\nA walk-up food counter at the new Delta One lounge at JFK Airport. Leslie Josephs | CNBC",

        "body": "Shein, the fast fashion giant with links to China, has confidentially filed for a public listing in London as it faces backlash in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.\n\nThe person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.\n\nThe company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.\n\nElected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.\n\nShein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.\n\nShein declined to comment to CNBC.\n\nReuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.\n\nShein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a \"global\" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company \u2014 and could exert control over its operations and data.\n\nShein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.\n\nAs Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.\n\nIt's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.\n\nShein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.\n\nIn May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public \u2014 a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.\n\nEven so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.\n\n\"Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,\" Donald Tang told the Journal. \"We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.\"\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.\n\n\"Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,\" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. \"However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.\"\n\nThose comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.\n\nRecent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only \"modest further progress.\"\n\nBowman noted that there are \"a number of upside risks\" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.\n\n\"I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\" she said. \"Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nWhile that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% \"for some time.\"\n\nMoreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said \"it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.\"\n\nIn other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.\n\n\"With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,\" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nWhile Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.\n\nBoth officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.\n\n\"I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. \"We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.\"\n\nAlso, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees \"more months\" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.\n\nAs governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's\n\n\"dot plot\" grid of rate expectations as well as the Summary of Economic Projections.",

        "body": "Microsoft Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Artificial Intelligence Kevin Scott speaks at the Microsoft Briefing event at the Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\n\nThe debate over when the Federal Reserve will start to lower interest rates, and the persistence of the artificial intelligence frenzy, are the two key factors that have been influencing the U.S. stock market. Meanwhile, concerns about the course of the economy continue to affect investor sentiment.\n\nAgainst that uncertain backdrop, Wall Street analysts are focused on identifying stocks with solid fundamentals and strong long-term growth prospects. Investors can look at the recommendations of top analysts to gain useful insights before making any investment decision.\n\nIn that climate, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nWe start with Delta Air Lines (DAL), America's second-largest carrier. DAL reaches more than 290 destinations across six continents via 4,000 daily flights. Following the company's presentation at the Toronto Corporate Access Day recently held by TD Cowen, analyst Helane Becker reiterated a buy rating on DAL with a price target of $55.\n\nDelta is TD Cowen's 2024 Best Idea, Becker said, adding, \"Delta has a differentiated product in which they continue to invest, but what stands out is their strategic plan.\"\n\nBecker believes that management's focus on DAL's strategic plan for the past 15 years is delivering the desired results, making the stock attractive. Delta's stable management team is a key differentiator from its rivals, she said.\n\nBecker highlighted several strengths, including Delta's extensive network, strategic partnerships with other airlines and operational reliability, reflected in its improved net promoter scores over the past 10 years.\n\nThe analyst also noted Delta's commentary about continued strength in demand among premium customers (annual income of more than $100,000). Further, the carrier is seeing a solid rebound in corporate travel, with volumes rising by more than double digits on a year-over-year basis. Delta is also strengthening its financial position by continuing to reduce debt.\n\nBecker ranks No. 276 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. (See Delta Air Lines Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nMicrosoft\n\nOur next pick is software giant Microsoft (MSFT). The company, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of the generative AI (artificial intelligence) wave.\n\nRecently, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock and raised his price target to $550 from $475. The analyst believes that Microsoft is \"increasingly positioned to lead the AI revolution through the ongoing integration of generative AI functionality throughout its software stack and product portfolio.\"\n\nFeinseth noted that Microsoft's revenue growth of 17% in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31 was driven by the accelerated adoption of the company's AI-enabled offerings and AI cloud integration. The company's cloud business delivered robust performance, thanks to the demand for the Azure platform.\n\nFeinseth also highlighted Micrsoft's growing strength in gaming and efforts to expand into the Metaverse. Notably, MSFT's gaming business is expected to benefit from the $75 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition and the rollout of the new Xbox gaming console.\n\nFinally, Feinseth mentioned Microsoft's strong financial position, which supports enhanced shareholder returns and enables investments in the company's AI ambitions.\n\nFeinseth ranks No. 242 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.2%. (See Microsoft Technical Analysis on TipRanks)\n\nZscaler\n\nThis week's third stock is Zscaler (ZS), one of the leading cloud-based cybersecurity players. The company's Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform securely connects users, devices and applications by protecting them from cyberattacks and data loss.\n\nFollowing the Zenith Live 2024 event, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari reaffirmed a buy rating on Zscaler stock with a price target of $260. Discussing the key takeaways from the event, the analyst said that Zscaler is trying to capture additional market opportunities by expanding its platform.\n\nIn particular, Kothari noted the introduction of the Zscaler Identity Protection feature that capitalizes on advanced machine learning to strengthen identity security across cloud environments. He also mentioned the Cloud Browser Isolation offering that safeguards user devices and the DLP 2.0 solution, which has AI-driven capabilities to ensure the safety of sensitive data.\n\nThese new capabilities on Zscaler's platform have boosted its total addressable market by more than $24 billion to $96 billion. Kothari also emphasized the shift in the company's go-to-market strategy from a transactional focus to account-centric selling. Under the new sales approach, Zscaler is focusing on adding more customers with an ARR (annual recurring revenue) above $10 million.\n\n\"Impressive customer-success stories, particularly in the financial/healthcare/manufacturing sectors, underscore Zscaler's security-at-scale,\" said Kothari.\n\nKothari ranks No. 381 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.6%. (See Zscaler Financial Statements on TipRanks)",

        "title": "Starboard loses initial legal fight against Autodesk, but the battle may just be beginning",
        "body": "Business: Autodesk engages in three-dimensional (3D) design, engineering and entertainment technology solutions. Its product offerings are focused on the following categories: Architecture, Engineering and Construction, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, Manufacturing, and Media and Entertainment. Its products include AutoCAD Civil 3D, Building Connected, Autodesk Build, Revit, Computer-Aided Manufacturing Solutions, Fusion 360, ShotGrid and 3ds Max. Autodesk's product development and manufacturing software provides manufacturers in automotive, transportation, industrial machinery, consumer products and building product industries with comprehensive digital design, engineering, manufacturing and production solutions. It also offers Wonder Studio, which is a cloud-based 3D animation and VFX solution.\n\nActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. The firm has taken a total of 150 activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 24.83% versus 12.99% for the Russell 2000 over the same period. Starboard has had an even better track record in the information technology sector. In 53 prior engagements, it has a return of 36.43% versus 18.82% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.\n\nOn June 17 , Starboard sent a letter to Autodesk's shareholders announcing that it is filing a lawsuit to compel the company to delay its 2024 annual meeting, scheduled for July 16, and to reopen the director nomination window. This follows Autodesk's delayed disclosure of an internal investigation into reporting irregularities that Starboard says may have misled and possibly disenfranchised shareholders. The Delaware Chancery Court ruled against Starboard on June 20, but the activist still thinks that Autodesk requires board enhancement, as well as improved growth and profitability through operational performance, capital allocation policies and investor communications.\n\nAutodesk is a global leader in design, engineering and entertainment software solutions. About 75% of revenue is generated from Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) solutions. These are application areas in which Autodesk is the No. 1 or No. 2 player \u2014 where it generates significant recurring revenue and maintains pricing power. Its remaining revenue comes from its growing manufacturing applications (20%) and legacy applications in entertainment like movies and TV (5%).\n\nWith 90%+ gross margins and 35% operating margins, Autodesk is a leader in AEC software. The company's gross margins are best in class, a reflection of its value add and pricing power. Further, its operating margins are not much worse than those of its peers at first blush. However, Starboard correctly does not judge the company's operating margins on the mean of its peer set, but by the potential embodied in its gross margins and market position. Autodesk currently spends approximately 28% of its revenue on sales and marketing versus 23% for peers, and 9% on general and administrative expenses compared to 5% to 7% for peers. In other words, operating expenses as a percent of revenue is roughly 1,000 basis points higher than peers. Moreover, the company's FY2023 operating margins of 36% missed its own target of 38%, which was adjusted downward from an original target of 40% despite front-loading revenue through multiyear contracts. This engagement had great potential to be an excellent amicable and constructive activist campaign for Starboard. The firm has had great experience working with companies just like Autodesk from a board level to improve margins and create tremendous shareholder value. That would have been a great plan here and would have likely meant adding only two or three directors to the board.\n\nBut the cooperative, constructive scenario was seemingly dashed on April 1, when Autodesk publicly notified shareholders that its annual report would be submitted late following information being delivered to the audit committee, which resulted in the launch of an investigation regarding the company's free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices. Ultimately, the committee found that despite signaling to investors that it would be shifting its enterprise customers toward annual billing, Autodesk had recently pursued multi-year upfront contracts at levels that even exceeded their historical use, helping the company meet its FY23 free cash flow goal.\n\nTo make matters worse, the company informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of these issues by early March, but it withheld the information from investors until after the closure of its nomination window, preventing a potential activist director nomination this year. Despite this, Starboard said it reached out privately to offer to work with Autodesk to improve the board, but the company declined. So, Starboard requested that Autodesk reopen the nomination window so that shareholders could make a fully informed decision following the recent disclosures, given the fact pattern. The company rejected that offer. Starboard filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to compel Autodesk to delay its 2024 annual meeting set for July 16 and to reopen its nomination window, which closed on March 23. The court rejected Starboard's claim on June 20.\n\nWhile the findings of the investigation alone are worrisome, there are two things in our mind that could elevate it from an acute accounting issue to a much more serious governance issue. First, while Autodesk reports free cash flow as a key operational metric, it was also a factor in executive compensation. Second, how the board and management responded to this investigation might be an even bigger problem. Here, the board seemed to determine that Deborah Clifford could no longer remain as CFO. What happened next did not exactly inspire a strong feeling of board oversight and accountability: Instead of firing her, Autodesk appointed Clifford to the role of chief strategy officer. While the first issue reflects on management and its lack of alignment with shareholders, the second issue goes directly to the board's ability to oversee management and hold them accountable.\n\nIt is incontrovertible that these developments at Autodesk will require governance changes. The level of change that is necessary will not depend on the company's acts, but rather the level of involvement. Starboard does not know yet whether this situation can be rectified with a few board seats or a total board and management overhaul, but that will become clearer as more facts as to accountability come out. From our perspective, the company's response with respect to penalizing management and notifying and working with shareholders does not bode well for the \"minor change\" scenario. The governance issue is paramount here and must be addressed before Starboard can make any real economic changes directly enhancing shareholder value.\n\nOnce that is resolved, a reconstituted board and management team to the extent necessary can focus on improving operating margins and trading multiples. Improving margins by 1,000 basis points by itself could greatly increase shareholder value, but applying a bigger multiple to that will have an exponential effect. Presently, Autodesk trades at an EV/CY2025E earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiple of 19.4x versus some peers above 30x and a peer average of 23.5x. A good argument can be made that a market leader like Autodesk should trade at a higher-than-average multiple, but just getting to the peer average would be very meaningful for shareholders. This happens when shareholders have more confidence in the governance of the company \u2013 when the board offers more transparency, oversight and accountability \u2013 and when management hits its targets as opposed to missing and lowering them.\n\nWhether that happens will depend on several things. Starboard's loss in the Delaware Court takes the quick scenario off of the table. While there is a proposal on the proxy this year that would allow 25% of shareholders to call a special meeting, even if that is approved, the company can drag its feet on implementation so it would not really be useful prior to the next annual meeting. This might come down to how hard the board wants to dig in and how convincing Starboard and other shareholders can be. Otherwise, it will have to wait until 2025. The good news is that Starboard is an activist with the patience and conviction to wait until 2025. If it comes to that, the company's chances of winning would go down dramatically.\n\nOne final note: This is not the first time Autodesk has been engaged by an activist. Sachem Head had an activist campaign here between November 2015 and June 2017, and ultimately settled for three board seats and the appointment of a new CEO, Andrew Anagnost, who is currently at Autodesk's helm. It should be noted that one of the director designees pursuant to Sachem Head's agreement was Rick Hill, who has a very interesting relationship with Starboard. He was the chairman of Tessera when Starboard waged a proxy fight there. At the time, he fought the firm tooth and nail and was its most vocal opponent. Starboard ultimately replaced a majority of the board with Hill staying on and eventually becoming the firm's biggest supporter. Since then, he has served as its director designee at both Marvell Technology and Symantec. He no longer serves on the board of Autodesk, but he could certainly be an informal advisor to Starboard \u2013 or a cautionary tale for Autodesk.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",
        "summary": "Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement.\nWith 90%+ gross margins and 35% operating margins, Autodesk is a leader in AEC software.\nFurther, its operating margins are not much worse than those of its peers at first blush.\nHowever, Starboard correctly does not judge the company's operating margins on the mean of its peer set, but by the potential embodied in its gross margins and market position.\nHe no longer serves on the board of Autodesk, but he could certainly be an informal advisor to Starboard \u2013 or a cautionary tale for Autodesk.",

The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It\u2019s OK to have penises in the women\u2019s swimming pool, in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m old; it\u2019s that your ideas are stupid.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\nMaher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to those people, you\u2019re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time \u2014 and they are \u2014 and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should keep the dialogue open,\u201d the HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host added.\n\nMaher recently appeared on the ABC talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.\n\n\u201cIf I had any doubt that I was right about the change that\u2019s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas \u2014 that straightened me out pretty quick,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to me that they can\u2019t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities.

Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.\n\nChange is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.\n\nIt's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.\n\nThe raw emotion of the protests \u2014 including images of women publicly burning their hijabs \u2014 has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.\n\nExplosive Yearning\n\nThe protests, known as the \"Women, Life, Freedom Movement\", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.\n\nAnd the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.\n\nThe protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its \"morality police\" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.\n\nThis movement continues to gather momentum.\n\nIncreasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nThe change is not only social. It's religious, too.\n\nChristians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith \u2014 and those are just ones we know about.\n\nBut most Iranians don't see Christians as \"the enemy\" anymore.\n\nA generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.\n\nYet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.\n\nIllegal house churches \u2014 believers secretly meeting in homes \u2014 are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.\n\nA New Revolution\n\nBut new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's \"isolated\" believers.\n\nThey're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as T\u00fcrkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.\n\nThere's more to this new media revolution.\n\nSAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.\n\nSocial media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.\n\nA boy named Kaamran told us: \"The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.\"\n\nChange is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.\n\nIn fact, it's already here.\n\n--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and \"digital church\" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.",

        "body": "An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.\n\nThe official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.\n\nThe decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, \"This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.\"\n\nWATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban\n\nWhat the Case Is Really About\n\nThe Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.\n\nIdaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's \"health\" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.\n\nAnd the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent \"a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.\"\n\nDuring the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.\n\n\"One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,\" he said, \"is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'\"\n\nAlito pointed out, \"So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAbortion Leaks at the Supreme Court\n\nTwo years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\nThe Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.\n\n\n\nPro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, \"With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.\"",

        "body": "Human rights groups say 36,000 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the last two decades, including Mrs. Son, a former official of the North Korean military. During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.\n\n\n\nShe told CBN News, \"My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.\"\n\n\n\nIn order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.\n\n\n\n\"We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,\" Mrs. Son said.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.\n\n\"My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.\n\n\n\n\"Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.\"\n\n\n\nAfter yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.\n\n\n\n\"The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released\u2026 malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,\" Mrs. Son recounted.\n\n\n\nOnce in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.\n\nThe name of the church, \"Seopyoung\" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.\n\n\n\nRev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, \"It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.\"\n\n\"During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,\" he reports. \"Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.\"\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.\n\n\n\n\"I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,\" Mrs. Son said.",

        "title": "'Only God': Couple Finds Jesus After Previously Getting Married as Gay, Transgender",
        "body": "\u201cOnly God can do that.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband \u2014 who used to identify as homosexual \u2014 came to faith in Jesus.\n\nNic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple \u2014 husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire\u2019s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.\n\nKnowles, a Catholic, described the couple\u2019s testimony as \u201cone of the wildest stories I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nIn addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,\u201d said Nic of their experience together. \u201cBut nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe world can tell you so much about who you\u2019re \u2018supposed to be\u2019 based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might \u2026 make you feel included for a time.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the \u201clie\u201d of the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe whole world in the queer community was saying, \u2018Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'\u201d she recalled hearing. \u201c[But] that argument doesn\u2019t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, \u2018God made me this way,\u2019 then that means that I should have been a woman.\u201d\n\nLex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging \u2014 something she had not previously found in her family or faith.\n\nShe grew up in an abusive household \u2014 one that claimed to be \u201cChristian\u201d \u2014 with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, \u201cIf I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,\u201d a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.\n\nEvery time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would \u201creject me.\u201d Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.\n\n\u201cI ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to walk with you through this journey.\u2019 But all I faced was rejection.\u201d\n\nNic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, \u201cnever tried to change me,\u201d even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God\u2019s design for males and females.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.\u201d\n\nInitially, as a transgender male \u2014 meaning biologically female \u2014 and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.\n\nThey currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.\n\nThe couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn\u2019t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.\n\n\u201cThey chose to love us,\u201d Lex said of the church they attended. \u201cAnd that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.\u201d\n\nIn March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,\u201d Lex wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cHe is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, \u2018I do,\u2019 after Pastor Ivan said, \u2018Do you take her to be your bride.\u2019 Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic\u2019s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.\n\n\"Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,\" The Times reports.\n\nThe administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.\n\nMore than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.\n\nLATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children\n\nCritics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.\n\nBut as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that \"children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.\"\n\nMORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'\n\nWhen we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, \"The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nMeanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed \"weak evidence\" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.\n\n\"This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,\" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. \"In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.\"\n\nThere is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender.

        "title": "Will Netanyahu Support a Palestinian State in Address to Congress?",
        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 There are media reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be about to abandon his opposition to a Palestinian state next to Israel. That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.\n\nAides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.\n\nYet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu \"opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.\"\n\nThe prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.\n\nItamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.\n\n\"There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,\" Marcus stated. \"There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th \u2013 and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres \u2013 and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.\"\n\nPreparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays\n\nOn another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.\n\nIn Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.\n\nGallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. \"The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,\" the defense minister said.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. \"We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,\" Fetterman declared.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war.

        "body": "Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Better Medicine than Pills and Surgery, Doctor Says\n\nAmericans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.\n\nAfter watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.\n\n\"She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,\" Dr. Means told CBN News.\n\nDitching Mainstream Medicine\n\nAfter becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.\n\n\"What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.\n\n\"This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nShe explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.\n\nDiet Matters Most\n\nDr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take \"an ultra-aggressive stance on diet\" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.\n\n\"The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,\" Dr. Means said. \"Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.\"\n\nAfter nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nAvoid Processed Foods\n\nDr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,\" she said. \"Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.\"\n\nShe advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The true story of Jose Hernandez is out-of-this-world.\n\nAs a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.\n\nNow, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called \"A Million Miles Away.\"\n\nHernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.\n\n\"The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,\" he said.\n\n\"When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,\" he continued.\n\nHernandez described his personal path to perseverance.\n\n\"I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,\" he told CBN News.\n\nFaith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,\" he told CBN News.\n\nMany are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.\n\n\"It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,\" he said.\n\nAs a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.\n\n\"My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,\" he continued.\n\nAs Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.\n\n\"A Million Miles Away\" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.\n\n",

        "body": "Reports of stunning mass baptisms are coming out of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where one Christian leader revealed that more than 300,000 people have been baptized this year into the Christian faith.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.\n\nThe outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.\n\nThe effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.\n\nWilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.\n\n\u201cThe latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in \u2018PNG for Christ\u2019 with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.\u201d\n\nHe followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.\n\nWilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the \u201cHoly Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nJust days before Wilson\u2019s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.\n\nWith so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people \u2014 an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers\u2019 desire to express their faith.\n\nThe impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of \u201cdrug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.\u201d\n\nPNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.\n\n\u201cIt is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,\u201d he told the Adventist Record. \u201cI would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nBe sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.\n\nCBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.\n\n\n\nScars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.\n\n\n\n\"When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you \u2013 but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,\" said Pastor Bailey.\n\n\n\nThe first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.\n\n\n\nAfter 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.\n\nPastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.\n\n\n\n\"I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'\" Pastor Bailey recounted. \"And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.\"\n\n\n\nVolunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.\n\n\"They came in with resources that blew our minds,\" said Bailey. \"They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.\"\n\nStephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.\n\n\"I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,\" said Robinson. \"But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.\"\n\nDespite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.\n\n\"And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,\" said Robinson.\n\nPastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.\n\n\"But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,\" said Pastor Bailey. \"I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.\n\nThe Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.\n\n\"We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,\" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.\n\nScala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.\n\n\"For academics, we look at it based purely on data,\" Scala explained. \"So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.\n\n\"We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,\" Scala said.\n\nIn the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.\n\n\"We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,\" Scala said.\n\nThis is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Franklin Graham\u2019s suggestion he avoid using course language during his speeches, essentially because it makes his addresses less interesting.\n\nIn a clip shared on X, Trump praised Graham as a \u201cman I like\u201d and described him as someone he admires before recalling a letter the evangelist \u2014 the son of the late Billy Graham \u2014 wrote, in which he asked the brash politician to stop using \u201cfoul language\u201d on his campaign stops.\n\nAt a rally in Philadelphia, Trump tells crowd that Franklin Graham wrote him a letter telling him his speeches would be better if he didn\u2019t use \u201cfoul language.\u201d Trump says Graham is \u201cwrong!\u201d @Franklin_Graham #trump pic.twitter.com/1zfMKpL9a3 \u2014 Jesse Jackson (@JesseTJackson) June 23, 2024\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn\u2019t use foul language,'\u201d Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump claimed he has been working \u201cso hard\u201d to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues \u2014 which often run between one and two hours \u2014 make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.\n\nHe requested Graham allow him \u201cone or two\u201d curse words, because \u201cif you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t get the emphasis.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nTo show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump said, \u201cI was really good. I didn\u2019t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.\u201d\n\nThe likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: \u201cWhen I see people start to walk out, then we\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to use the word bull****,\u201d Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad a word.\u201d\n\nAs for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.\n\nIn 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver \u2014 a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\u201cThese ten, from [Trump\u2019s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,\u201d Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cIt makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.\u201d\n\nNews of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThere are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,\u201d he said in a statement shared with CBN News. \u201cWe know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out \u2014 whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.\n\n\"Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,\" Austin said Tuesday. \"And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.\"\n\nStill, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,\" Austin stated.\n\nYoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.\n\n\"The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,\" Gallant insisted.\n\nIn Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.\n\nFormer Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. \"And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,\" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. \"The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy \u2013 and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,\" Lipman said.\n\nAnd in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive \u201cSquad\u201d lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman\u2019s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "He is the first former member of China's secret police to speak publicly about Beijing's active campaign to silence Chinese pro-democracy voices overseas.\n\nCalling himself 'Eric,' he was an agent for China's Ministry of Public Security or 'First Bureau,' from 2008 until last year, when he defected to Australia.\n\nHe told CBN News, \"My job was to collect intelligence about the country I was in and the anti-communist groups there. I was supposed to infiltrate these groups, make friends, and trap targets for return to China.\"\n\nEric was coerced into becoming an agent in 2008 after his arrest for supporting a pro-democracy party and given a choice: help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) catch dissidents abroad or go to jail. He chose the former, taking on fake identities, such as a property executive and an anti-communist freedom fighter, to lure dissidents to countries where they could be abducted and returned to China.\n\nBut because he secretly protected targets and says no one was arrested because of his work, his handlers became suspicious, and he decided to defect.\n\n\"I did not want to be responsible for any targets being returned to China and tried to make sure that did not happen, and this made my bosses suspicious of me,\" Eric said.\n\nEric's testimony confirms our reporting and the reports of others that a Chinese government spy network is threatening, entrapping, and even kidnapping critics of the Chinese communist government.\n\nCBN News Coverage: China Is Operating Illicit Police Stations Inside the US - Why Are They Still Allowed to Be Here?\n\n\"These are kind of the methods being used by the CCP. This is not an allegation we're making. This is what their official documents state,\" says Laura Harth, who tracks Chinese transnational repression for the human rights group Safeguard Defenders.\n\nCCP Agents like Eric are known to operate in the U.S., but Harth says these agents are only one part of a larger campaign by the Chinese government, called \"The United Front.\"\n\n\n\n\"The United Front is something that's being defined by the Chinese Communist Party as one of its 'secret' or 'magic' weapons. And essentially its task is two things: On the one hand, expand the circle of friends of the Chinese Communist Party. So, co-opting or influencing, politicians, media, academia, and entrepreneurs. But on the other hand, its task is also to crack down on critics, to silence them, to divide them.\"\n\nREAD China's Big Brother 'Social Credit System' Now Tracks People in North America Too with Video Surveillance\n\n\n\nAn Amnesty International survey of Chinese students in 24 universities in Europe and North America found that many live in fear of surveillance, harassment, or intimidation by Chinese agents.\n\nDissidents sent us photos of Chinese police paying visits to their relatives and warning them they face trouble and even jail if their family member doesn't stop criticizing the Chinese government.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear how many of the so-called Chinese police stations used to control dissidents are still operating in the U.S. On paper, it might be less than five. The one we reported about above a noodle shop in New York City was finally shut down by authorities.\n\nHarth says, \"It's important to recognize that police stations or so-called police stations is really the tip of the iceberg. It's much more widespread than one, two or three single stations. We need to take a broad view and understand what the wider picture looks like and the amount of proxies and networks that the Chinese Party-state is operating.\"\n\n\n\nBob Fu, founder and president of the Texas-based ministry China Aid helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student. He still faces harassment by Chinese agents, 35 years later.\n\n\n\nFu told CBN News, \"In recent months, even I have been harassed and receiving threats, text messages and also CCP agents booked hotels under my name and then called the police, from New York to Los Angeles, from Washington, D.C. to Houston, basically for bomb threats, and said 'Bob Fu was about to set off bombs.'\"\n\nMUST SEE 'The Perfect Police State': China's Digital Dictatorship Goes Global\n\n\n\nPro-democracy activist Lijian Jie in Los Angeles, who Chinese agents have tried to kill three times, told us Chinese-Americans are \"still surrounded by constant threats of danger.\"\n\n\n\nIn a special message to his former colleagues still trying to harass and trap Chinese dissidents, Eric encouraged them to \"recognize the nature of the communist party,\" that \"it is a fascist totalitarian party,\" and that \"carrying out these illegal and secret activities in various countries is not good for you.\" He challenges them to instead \"do something good for human civilization.\"\n\n\n\nBeijing's continued repression of overseas Chinese begs the question, if those Chinese who have fled communism for freedom still live in fear of the Chinese Communist Party, are they really free?\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Amber Love comes from a long, tragic line of trafficking survivors.\n\n\"My birth mother was trafficked by her mother, and my grandmother was also trafficked as well,\" Love said during an appearance on CBN's The PrayerLink.\n\nShe shared details of childhood sexual abuse, abandonment, and how at 18 she was being groomed for sex.\n\n\"I remember the first encounter that I had being exploited was with a 38-year-old man who was giving me, providing me shelter and a place to stay,\" Love explained. \"But it required that I wait for him in his bed. And because I had nowhere to go or no idea what to do or how to survive, I did those things for a while. And what I found out was that when I decided I don't want to do this anymore, there's got to be another way, I found myself homeless again.\"\n\nIt was a journey that led to 15 years of being trafficked for sex.\n\nBrittnay Dunn helps lead the Safe House Project, a non-profit aiming to eradicate human trafficking while offering holistic support to those who want out. So far, the group has helped more than 500 victims nationwide.\n\n\"Every day we're out there working to elevate people's understanding of the issue so that more people feel like they can identify and receive the support services,\" Dunn told CBN News.\n\n\"Our survivor support team is out there every single day fielding calls from across the country of survivors or advocates or law enforcement who have identified somebody saying, 'I'm ready to get out. I'm ready to have 10 seconds of insane courage where I believe that I can trust in you enough, and that there is a hope and a freedom and a future that is free of victimization,'\" explained Dunn.\n\nIt is a freedom that Love has come to know and share as a member of the Safe House Project staff.\n\n\"Oftentimes human trafficking becomes your identity,\" said Love. \"But that's not who we are. We are children of God. We were bought for a price (by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ). Our redemption has been paid for.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n\"We belong to the Lord. And in spite of all that pain and suffering, letting go of that trusting, hoping that God would put a new identity in my hands, and that's what I hope for them,\" said Love.",

        "title": "UK general election 2024: everything you need to know",
        "body": "Print this page\n\nThe UK general election is days away and, as the nation prepares to vote, pollsters are predicting a landslide victory for Labour. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose campaign has been plagued by mishaps, has urged voters to support the Conservatives to avoid a sweeping Labour majority, while Reform UK, Green and Liberal Democrat leaders are seeking to win over voters disillusioned by the two main parties.\n\nHere is a guide to the people and pledges that will shape the vote on July 4.\n\nLabour party\n\nSince becoming Labour leader in 2020, Sir Keir Starmer has worked to convince business leaders and voters that his party can be trusted with the nation\u2019s purse-strings. It has pledged to boost economic growth and ruled out increasing the rate of several taxes, but a lack of concrete revenue-raising proposals has led to accusations that the Labour manifesto is based on \u201cvibes.\u201d\n\nStarmer has stated that wealth creation is Labour\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. However, fiscal experts have warned that any party that wins the election will need to raise taxes or cut spending significantly as the UK grapples with poor public finances.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 206 Seats in Parliament before dissolution 326 Total seats needed to form a majority What\u2019s at stake: If Labour wins the July 4 general election, as poll predict, the challenge for the party will be to deliver on its promise of economic stability and improved public services.\n\nLabour\u2019s key policies\n\nConservatives\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 14 years in power have been marked by turmoil and a series of stark contrasts. Rising employment levels and the pensions \u201ctriple-lock\u201d sit alongside a decline in real wages, a deterioration of public services, and the costs and complications of Brexit. Since the 2016 referendum, the party has struggled to contain infighting, producing five prime ministers in nine years. Sunak\u2019s promise to cut inflation has been kept, but pledges to reduce NHS waiting lists and \u201cstop the boats\u201d that bring in illegal migrants have failed.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 345 Seats in Parliament before dissolution 65 MPs not standing for re-election What\u2019s at stake: The Conservatives\u2019 biggest challenge this election is regaining the trust of ordinary voters to avoid an electoral wipeout. Several Tory \u201csafe seats\u201d are predicted to turn red or yellow as the nation grapples with a cost of living crisis, the longest National Health Service waiting list in memory, and an economy described as the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d.\n\nKey policies\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nTraditionally the UK\u2019s third major party, the Lib Dems have not been in power for more than a century, except as a coalition partner with the Tories from 2010-15. Leader Sir Ed Davey\u2019s manifesto pledge to secure a favourable trade deal with the EU has set them apart in a political landscape largely devoid of any debate on Brexit. Earlier this year, Davey told the FT that the party expects to win votes from \u201cTheresa May Conservative[s]\u201d in Tory strongholds.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 15 Seats in Parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: Ahead of the election, the Lib Dems \u201chave a simple task \u2014 tell voters that they exist, persuade those voters that the Lib Dems should win, that the Conservatives can be beaten, and equally importantly that Labour cannot beat them\u201d.\n\nReform UK\n\nFounded by Nigel Farage as the Brexit party, the since-rebranded Reform UK aims to tap into discontent with the major parties over issues including immigration. The party chose not to stand against the Conservatives in 2019, but is now fielding candidates in almost every seat. Described by its leadership as an \u201centrepreneurial political start-up\u201d, Reform has been a growing force in the election, overtaking the Tories in some polls.\n\nThough not expected to win many constituencies, Reform is likely to take support from the Tories that may cost the incumbent party a significant number of seats.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in Parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: A strong Reform turnout is likely to be detrimental to Conservative seats, but the party's future beyond being a rightwing protest vote remains unclear.\n\nSNP\n\nThe current largest party in Scotland, the SNP dominates areas that were traditionally held by Labour. However, the party has struggled to raise campaign funds following a police investigation into alleged embezzlement of party coffers and the forced resignation of two leaders in as many years.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 43 Seats in Parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: The SNP faces the challenge of repelling Labour in its traditional heartlands. The party is forecast to win 21 seats in Scotland, down from 48 in 2019. Independence, rejected by the Scottish people in a 2014 referendum, remains a long-term goal.\n\nGreen party\n\nThe Green party has moved beyond its traditional environmental focus to position itself as the pre-eminent leftwing Labour alternative, in the hopes of stealing voters disillusioned by Starmer\u2019s policies on Gaza, taxation and public investment.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in Parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: The Green party\u2019s primary goal in the July 4 election is to increase its representation in parliament and influence policy on environmental issues as public concern over climate change grows.\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s campaign has focused on advocating for the interests of Wales in Westminster. The party has emphasised the need for greater investment in the Welsh economy and healthcare system and has pledged \u00a34bn in funds from HS2 to improve the country\u2019s public transport.",

        "title": "Democrats close ranks around Joe Biden after disastrous debate",
        "body": "President Joe Biden worked forcefully Friday to quell Democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing in his debate with former President Donald Trump, as elected members of his party closed ranks around him in an effort to shut down talk of replacing him atop the ticket.\n\nBiden\u2019s halting delivery and meandering comments, particularly early in the debate, fueled concerns from even members of his own party that at age 81 he\u2019s not up for the task of leading the country for another four years. It created a crisis moment for Biden\u2019s campaign and his presidency, as members of his party flirted with potential replacements, and donors and supporters couldn\u2019t contain their concern about his showing against Trump.\n\nBiden appeared to acknowledge the criticism during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying \u201dI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to.\u201d But he added, \u201cI know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.\u201d Speaking for 18 minutes, Biden appeared far more animated than he had the night before as he excoriated Trump for his \u201clies\u201d and for waging a campaign aimed at \u201crevenge and retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice in this election is simple,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.\u201d\n\nHe added, alluding to his candidacy, \u201cWhen you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d\n\nEven before the debate, Biden\u2019s age had been a liability with voters, and Thursday night\u2019s faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will garner in the four months until Election Day.\n\nPrivately, his campaign worked to tamp down concerns and keep donors and surrogates on board. Democratic lawmakers on Friday acknowledged Biden\u2019s poor showing, but tried to stop talk of replacing him as their standard-bearer, and instead shift the focus to Trump\u2019s attacks and falsehoods.\n\n\u201cWell, the president didn\u2019t have a good night, but neither did Donald Trump with lie after lie and his dark vision for America,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told The Associated Press on Friday, hours before he introduced the president in Raleigh. \u201cWe cannot send Donald Trump back to the White House. He\u2019s an existential threat to our nation.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama backed up his former vice president, posting on X that \u201cBad debate nights happen.\u201d Alluding to his own poor showing in the first debate of his reelection campaign in 2012, Obama continued, \u201cTrust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLast night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries answered with a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked Friday if Biden should step aside.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., allowed he \u201chad to take a few more antidepressants than usual\u201d after Biden\u2019s debate showing.\n\nBut he added that \u201ca Donald Trump presidency would cause me far greater discomfort than a Joe Biden debate performance.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign billed the Raleigh event as the largest-yet rally of his reelection bid in the state Trump carried by the narrowest margin in 2020. He then traveled to New York for a weekend of big-dollar fundraisers that his campaign now needs more than ever.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign announced that it raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, while Trump\u2019s campaign said it raised more than $8 million from the start of the debate through the end of the night.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, whom the Biden campaign sent out to defend his performance, tried to reassure Biden supporters at a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, saying, \u201cThis race will not be decided by one night in June.\n\n\u201cThis race will be decided by you. By us,\u201d she said. \u201cWho sits in the White House next year will be determined by what we together do in these next 130 days.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said there had been no internal conversations \u201cwhatsoever\u201d about Biden stepping aside, though he, too, acknowledged that the president had a \u201cbad night\u201d on stage.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said he could hardly sleep because of the number of telephone calls he got after Biden performed \u201chorribly\u201d in the debate.\n\n\u201cPeople were just concerned. And I told everybody being concerned is healthy, overreacting is dangerous,\u201d Cleaver said.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat whose support in that state helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination four years ago, said he would likely speak to Biden later Friday and his message would be simple: \u201cStay the course.\u201d\n\nBiden and his team have long wagered that voters would look past their concerns about his age and unpopularity when confronted at the ballot box with a choice between the president and Trump. Despite their concerns about Biden\u2019s performance, they took solace in Trump doing little to expand his own appeal to voters on Thursday.\n\nPolls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men\u2019s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s conviction.\n\nDemocrats seized on Trump\u2019s equivocations on whether he would accept the will of voters this time around, his refusal to condemn the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, and his embrace of the conservative-leaning Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade that had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nBut Biden fumbled on abortion rights, one of the most important issues for Democrats in this year\u2019s election. He was unable to explain Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A conservative Supreme Court with three justices nominated by Trump overturned Roe two years ago.\n\nAs elected Democrats united behind Biden publicly, donors and party operatives shared panicked text messages and phone calls Thursday night and into Friday expressing their concern that Biden\u2019s performance was so bad that he may be unelectable this fall.\n\nAmong the few public Democratic voices calling on Biden to step aside was congressional candidate Nancy Boyda in Kansas, who broke with most in her party and called on Biden to suspend his campaign and retire at the end of his current term.\n\nBut there were no immediate signs of organized efforts among donors, his campaign leadership or the Democratic National Committee to convince the president to step aside, according to interviews with several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat frequently mentioned as a 2028 contender and speculated about as a potential replacement for Biden, released a statement backing him on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe difference between Joe Biden\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November,\u201d she said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom also dismissed questions on whether he would consider stepping in for Biden, telling reporters, \u201cI will never turn my back on him.\u201d\n\nUnder current Democratic Party rules, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace Biden as the party\u2019s nominee without his cooperation or without party officials being willing to rewrite the rules at the August national convention.\n\nTrump was set to hold a rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward Democrats in recent years but that his aides believe can flip toward the Republican in November.",

        "body": "More than 90% of Americans are planning to travel domestically this summer, and 37% plan to go abroad, according to a recent study from the financial services company Empower.\n\nBut to meet their vacation plans, consumers must continue to grapple with inflation and high prices, and nearly half of survey respondents said they planned to spend more on travel in 2024 than last year. So to bankroll their restlessness, Americans are putting other major life plans on hold.\n\nOne in five millennials\u2014and 17% of Gen Zers\u2014plan to postpone important life purchases, like buying a home, to pay for travel, according to the study. Roughly a third of all Americans said they won\u2019t wait for retirement to see the world and are prioritizing travel now.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just major financial milestones like buying a home and retirement that are being placed on the backburner, according to Empower. People are cutting back in little ways to pay for travel as well\u2014and in some cases, going into debt.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Gen Xers and millennials said they were cutting back on dining out to pay for travel, and nearly 10% of all respondents in the Empower study said they\u2019ve taken on debt to finance their trips, averaging $2,849. Of those people, more than a quarter said paying down their debt would take a year or longer.\n\nIn 2023, the travel industry boomed as consumer demand for experiences came back with a vengeance in the wake of the pandemic. A year later, that desire doesn\u2019t seem to have subsided. The Friday before Memorial Day, more than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports, breaking a single-day record set around Thanksgiving last year.\n\nOver the course of the summer, airlines expect to carry 271 million people, 6.3% more than the record-breaking season they had last year.\n\nA recent report from Expedia showed that Americans are more desperate than ever to get away: 65% of survey respondents told the travel company they felt deprived of vacation, even more than in the height of the pandemic.\n\nChristie Hudson, head of public relations at Expedia, told Fortune that a significant share of survey respondents plan to travel \u201cno matter what\u201d in 2024.\n\n\u201cIn terms of attitude and valuing experiences over things, that whole mentality, people seem very aligned coming out of the pandemic,\u201d said said.",

        "title": "Donald Trump says immigration is taking 'Black jobs.' Top economists: No",
        "body": "Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about \u201cBlack jobs\u201d that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, Trump said that President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cbig kill\u201d on Black people was allowing an influx of immigrants through the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs now\u2014and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs, and they\u2019re taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you\u2019re gonna see something that\u2019s going to be the worst in our history.\u201d\n\nMichelle Holder, a renowned labor economist who studies racial inequities, said she was dismayed and confused by the term.\n\n\u201cIt was insulting to me, as a Black labor economist, to hear the term \u2018black jobs,\u2019\u201d she told Fortune. She added that the comment, which was supposed to appeal to Black voters, likely \u201cbackfired.\u201d\n\nBlack workers have fared well under both the Trump and Biden administrations. The Black unemployment rate remains at historic lows. In September 2019, under Trump, the unemployment rate for the group fell to 5.3%, a record low at the time. Under Biden, it dropped even further to a new low of 4.8% in April 2023.\n\nToday, Black unemployment has risen slightly, to 6.1%, ticking up along with the national rate, which is at 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of Black Americans with jobs\u2014at 59.1%\u2014is still near a peak of 60.4% set last year.\n\nDespite the progress, the quote echos a long-held argument: An influx of immigration takes jobs away from native-born workers, or, at the very least, depresses their wages. Fortune asked Lant Pritchett, a leading immigration economist who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School and researches at University of Oxford, about this. He said that among economists, the question is \u201cpretty settled.\u201d\n\nImmigration does not take away native jobs\n\nThere is \u201calmost no evidence\u201d of an influx of immigration displacing disadvantaged workers, Pritchett said. He pointed to the study UC Berkeley economist David Card won a Nobel Prize for, which analyzed the impact of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift that brought hundreds of thousands of Cubans to Miami in a manner of months. Card found \u201cno effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers.\u201d If anything, wages rose relative to their previous trend in Miami.\n\nThe result was so surprising that economists analyzed the study again and again, attempting to understand how the real-life result defied economic principles. Card replicated the study with different cities, and another time with different types of immigrants, and found the same conclusion. Other economists found the same results in their own studies.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that\u2019s gone on in this immigration literature in the last few years is that we\u2019ve kind of concluded that there\u2019s a relatively small effect of it for competing natives,\u201d Card said in a previous interview.\n\nThen, in 2017, Harvard economist George Borjas replicated the study with a smaller definition of \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers and found their wages collapsed. The result drew attention from the Atlantic, National Review, and New Yorker, among others, and was heralded by Republicans.\n\nThe study also found that Black workers\u2019 wages fell, but Card cast doubt on the findings.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bI have followed this closely, but my sense is that other people who have looked into this in detail are not convinced,\u201d he told Fortune in a message on Friday.\n\nPritchett is one of them. He referred to an analysis done by another economist, Michael Clemens, who found that Borjas\u2019s study relied on only 17 individuals, much too small of a sample size to be relied on. He said that the hype around Borjas\u2019s work came from those with an anti-immigrant bias who were willing to cherry-pick data to prove it.\n\n\u201cIf you started from the question, what are things that are disadvantaging African Americans in economic progress, and you came to the conclusion that immigration was one of the big factors, I would listen to you,\u201d Pritchett said. \u201cBut if you start from a position, I\u2019m against immigration and have been in all ways, and then come to the conclusion that it negatively affects African Americans, I\u2019m pretty skeptical.\u201d\n\nThe need for more workers\n\nPritchett\u2019s research suggests that America will soon desperately need millions of workers to cover a \u201chistorically unprecedented\u201d gap in the labor force.\n\nAmerica\u2014like most wealthy countries\u2014has an aging population and could soon be faced with fewer workers. Over the decade of 2020 to 2030, the U.S. working-aged population will fall by 4.5 million people without immigration, according to a United Nations report. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that between 2021 and 2031, there will be 3.2 million net new jobs in entry-level positions.\n\n\u201cThat math cannot be made to add up,\u201d Pritchett said with a chuckle. \u201cYou can\u2019t fill 3 million new jobs with negative 4 million people.\u201d\n\nThe policy challenge used to be to find a job for every worker. Now, the U.S. will struggle to find a worker for every job, Pritchett said.\n\nSome experts have already suggested that immigrants are \u201csaving\u201d the U.S. from a taut labor market. Between January 2020 and July 2023, the immigrant labor force grew by 9.5%, dwarfing the 1.5% growth rate among native-born workers.\n\nWhat are the economic issues that do concern Black americans?\n\nThe most concerning issues for Black Americans, Holder said, are wages, inflation, and unemployment.\n\nBlack unemployment reached a historic low last year, she said. Can we sustain these current economic conditions? And, how are those jobs paying Black Americans?\n\nRather than using immigration to stoke fear, she wants Trump to answer those questions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think Black voters want to hear about,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we are really wrapped up in trying to blame migrants for any problems facing the Black community at this point.\u201d",
        "summary": "Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about \u201cBlack jobs\u201d that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs now\u2014and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cIt was insulting to me, as a Black labor economist, to hear the term \u2018black jobs,\u2019\u201d she told Fortune.\nToday, Black unemployment has risen slightly, to 6.1%, ticking up along with the national rate, which is at 4%.\nFortune asked Lant Pritchett, a leading immigration economist who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School and researches at University of Oxford, about this.",

        "body": "Microsoft Corp.\u2019s $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is set to come under added scrutiny from European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdogs, who are poised to quiz rivals about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s antitrust chief, announced Friday that the EU has ruled out an investigation under the EU\u2019s merger rules into the deal. Instead, she announced that regulators are asking Microsoft\u2019s rivals about the US company\u2019s exclusivity clauses with OpenAI, and whether they might have a negative effect on competition.\n\nBloomberg reported the news earlier.\n\nAs well as the focus on Microsoft, the EU will also circulate questions to the market on Google\u2019s arrangement with Samsung Electronics Co. to pre-install its small model \u201cGemini nano\u201d on certain devices.\n\nVestager added in a speech that regulators are examining attempts by Big Tech to buy firms by way of mass hires. The EU preliminary step comes after the US Federal Trade Commission launched investigations into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of Inflection staff.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure these practices don\u2019t slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\u201d Vestager said.\n\nUnder the terms of Microsoft\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, Microsoft\u2019s Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI \u2014 something that EU regulators want to examine more.\n\nSuch preliminary questions from the EU can sometimes lead to formal investigations from the EU\u2019s antitrust regulators. These probes \u2014 in the long run \u2014 can result in orders to change behavior and potential fines if watchdogs unearth evidence of abusive practices hampering fair competition.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the European Commission\u2019s thorough review and its conclusion that Microsoft\u2019s investment and partnership with OpenAI does not give Microsoft control over the company,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cWe stand ready to respond to any additional questions the EC may have.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\n\nThe EU\u2019s antitrust arm said in January it was reviewing whether Microsoft\u2019s involvement with OpenAI should be vetted after a mutiny at the ChatGPT creator exposed deep ties between the two firms.\n\nThe partnership first piqued the interest of regulators \u2014 including, as well as the EU, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission \u2014 since a scandal embroiled the AI firm over the firing and subsequent rehiring of Sam Altman as chief of OpenAI late last year.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella personally helped negotiate and advocate for his return to the company \u2014 at one point offering to hire Altman himself, along with other employees at OpenAI who wanted to leave.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board eventually agreed to reinstate Altman and the company then named a three-person interim board and added Microsoft as a non-voting observer.\n\nThat episode led regulators to examine the agreement. The UK watchdog said it would examine whether the balance of power between the two firms has fundamentally shifted to give one side more control or influence over the other, and the US Federal Trade Commission has made inquiries into the agreement.\n\nAt the core of the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI is the massive amounts of computer power required to keep the worldwide boom in generative AI going. Running the systems behind tools such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard has sent demand for cloud services and processing capacity soaring. OpenAI, for example, has become a major customer of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business.\n\nUnder the EU\u2019s merger rules, officials vet deals under strict time frames and often push for remedies to allay specific competition concerns. While deals are in rare cases vetoed, firms generally don\u2019t face punishments unless they mislead regulators or stymie the process.\n\nThe EU\u2019s classic competition law is generally used to home in on potentially anti-competitive agreements between firms and also cases where powerful players abuse their dominance. If wrongdoing is found, fines can rise to 10% of a company\u2019s revenue.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\n\nThis week the EU accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.",

        "body": "Chipotle executives have sworn up and down that the restaurant chain doesn\u2019t have a portion problem, but an analysis by Wells Fargo begs to differ.\n\nTo finally \u201cput the \u2018weight debate\u2019 to rest,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem and his team bought and weighed 75 burrito bowls, they wrote in a note this week. The analysts \u201cstudied\u201d (and hopefully later devoured) burrito bowls at eight different Chipotle locations in New York City, with half the orders placed digitally and the other half in person.\n\nThroughout the study, the analysts found that the bowls\u2019 weights were wildly inconsistent.\n\nThe median bowl ordered online and in person weighed about the same, according to the Thursday note, but the weight of the burrito bowls varied drastically in each category. For in-person orders, the heaviest bowl weighed 47% more than the lightest. The weight varied even more for digital orders, with the heaviest bowl weighing 87% more than the lightest bowl. At 13.8 ounces, the smallest burrito bowl weighed just a little more than the average can of soda.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s at least one New York City Chipotle that may also be worth avoiding, as the analysts found that many of the 10 lightest bowls were from the same unnamed store. All 10 were also digital orders.\n\n\u201cWhile throughput is improving, order consistency remains an opportunity,\u201d the analysts wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nA special look\n\nThe analysis comes as Chipotle has been criticized on social media for doling out supposedly smaller portion sizes. A rumor, which Chipotle denied, later emerged that the chain had instructed employees to give bigger portions to people recording them, sparking a flurry of videos across social media, especially on TikTok.\n\nLast month, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told Fortune that portion sizes had not gotten smaller, but added that customers could give employees a \u201clook\u201d to bulk up their burritos.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chipotle founder and former CEO Steve Ells reiterated that the restaurant chain\u2019s portions have not shrunk and insisted that it has, in fact, been \u201cquite generous\u201d with its portion sizes, Quartz reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced someone walking out of a Chipotle hungry in my 30 some odd years, I mean, it just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Ells said at the Wall Street Journal Global Food Forum. \u201cSo those who complain about portion sizes, I\u2019m not sure I quite get it, but I understand it\u2019s a thing out there.\u201d\n\nAlthough the varying bowl sizes may have looked bad for the chain, Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, Laurie Schalow, said the variability was totally normal because of how the restaurant serves its orders.\n\n\u201cSimilar to others in the fast casual industry, our completely customizable meals may have variability in their size or weight depending upon the number of ingredients a guest selects or if they choose to make an ingredient extra or light when ordering from our list of real ingredients in person or digitally,\u201d Schalow said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nDespite the controversy over portion sizes, Wells Fargo found that Chipotle\u2019s foot traffic continues to increase, aside from a setback last month, and the bank is still optimistic about the stock. The company\u2019s quarter-to-date foot traffic is at its highest level in 10 quarters, the bank found.",

        "body": "Considering the mania and absolute obsession over the Barbie movie last summer, one might guess it was an easy sell to Hollywood studios. Wrong.\n\n\u201cMovies are a crazy business where you are selling something that isn\u2019t tangible, it\u2019s an idea,\u201d Margot Robbie, the illustrious Australian actress who played Barbie in the beloved movie that made a whopping $1.4 billion at box offices, told The Times. \u201cYou have no idea how much it\u2019s going to make, who\u2019s going to see it, if they\u2019ll see it or how it will be received.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s been more of a sure thing for Robbie is the recent launch of her gin brand Papa Salt, which was inspired by her many nights out clubbing in London\u2019s Clapham neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThis feels a lot more straightforward, it\u2019s easier to predict things,\u201d Robbie said of getting into the alcohol business. \u201cYou can lay this out on a spreadsheet in a way that you can\u2019t lay out a movie idea.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s much more tangible to sell a product than an idea, and she has a team of friends\u2014Charlie Maas and Regan Riskas as well as her husband Tom Ackerley\u2014in business with her.\n\nThe idea for the subtly flavored gin goes all the way back to when Robbie would pack vanilla tea bags in her purse during her nights out at Infernos, a nightclub frequented by her and \u201cthousands of other Aussie Londoners,\u201d she told The Times. Gin and tonics were her go-to drink, but that doesn\u2019t mean they always tasted good.\n\n\u201cIf you pop one into a terrible G&T, it suddenly tastes great. My handbag would be littered with them,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019d buy a round and then just hand [out the tea bags].\u201d\n\nRobbie and her fellow Papa Salt cofounders were on a mission to make a gin that could \u201ccomplement any soda, taste great with tonic, and make a mean martini,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. It took them 59 recipes to get there, but now they\u2019re selling an \u201ceasy-drinking gin that celebrates the subtle taste of native Australian botanicals,\u201d such as zesty wax flower, hibiscus, and citrus peel. Nutty wattleseed (an edible seed from Australia), pink peppercorn, and oyster shell are also complementing flavors.\n\nWhile it was easier to sell an idea for a gin brand than a movie, that didn\u2019t mean it was completely effortless to make a great-tasting alcohol. Robbie traveled to Australia to meet with Brian Restall, the owner of a wildly popular distiller there, and they got \u201cabsolutely sh**faced\u201d together discussing the idea for the brand. But it didn\u2019t take long for Restall to be sold on the idea, according to a Forbes Australia article.\n\nHow much Margot Robbie is worth\n\nWhile Barbie undoubtedly smacked Robbie back into the spotlight last summer, she\u2019s been in several other hit movies and TV shows. She got her start on Australian soap opera Neighbours, in which she appeared in more than 300 episodes. She played disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort\u2019s glamorous wife Naomi Lapaglia in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, which made nearly $407 million at box offices. She also stared as Jane Porter in The Legend of Tarzan and as Harley Quinn in the Suicide Squad movies.\n\nBut her big recognition came when she won an Academy Award for her role as figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya, which landed her a role as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots. She infamously, though, wasn\u2019t nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in Barbie\u2014and neither was director Greta Gerwig, in what\u2019s been considered one of the biggest snubs in awards history. Barbie was the highest-grossing film of 2023, and in turn, Robbie brought home the biggest payday of any woman in Hollywood last year\u2014$12.5 million.\n\nRobbie is worth an estimated $60 million, which includes proceeds from the films in which she\u2019s starred as well as from LuckyChap Entertainment, a production company she started with her friends and husband.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do as an actor,\u201d Robbie told Marie Claire Australia in 2023. \u201cAs a producer you get to be a part of the conversations about who is being hired and in what roles and how much they\u2019re getting paid.\u201d",

        "title": "Stressed-out junior bankers have chest pains at the office but keep working as 100-hour weeks return to Wall Street",
        "body": "To see the stress mounting again on Wall Street\u2019s junior bankers, just look a half-rung higher, at staffers.\n\nNot staff, as in employees, but staffers, the unheralded deputy managers who dole out assignments to trainees. When investment bankers or clients want something done, staffers find underlings for the drudgery. That\u2019s getting trickier as banks exit a slump in deals with thinner headcount and big ambitions for landing new mandates.\n\nTrainees and staffers alike are now feeling the strain.\n\nA junior banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and another at UBS Group AG, for example, privately said they\u2019re inflating their weekly hours in internal tracking systems so bosses don\u2019t make them give up their last bits of free time. At Bank of America Corp., two trainees said they\u2019re instead understating to avoid breaching 100-hour limits, dubbed \u201ctripping the system,\u201d which can prompt a call from HR and stir up trouble for managers.\n\nWhen banks do run short of junior bankers to crank out analyses and pitch decks, it falls on staffers to tell the bosses tough luck. A Citigroup Inc. staffer recently recalled how nerve-wracking that was her first time.\n\nAfter emailing a managing director that everyone was too busy, she cried and got physically ill. When the response later arrived \u2014 \u201cI am so disappointed in you\u201d \u2014 she stared at her screen in angst. She later left.\n\nInterviews with current and recently departed junior bankers and their managers show that 100-hour work weeks, which never went away, are once again becoming more common as investment banks chase a modest but growing flow of deals. The employees asked not to be identified to protect their careers.\n\nThe swelling workloads are testing promises banks made just a few years ago to give trainees breaks and safeguard their health. And, for young bankers, it\u2019s bringing old frustrations back to the fore.\n\nThe death on May 2 of Bank of America associate Leo Lukenas from a heart attack \u2014 just days after the former Green Beret finished work on a $2 billion deal \u2014 triggered an outpouring of those feelings on online message boards. Though authorities attributed Lukenas\u2019 death to natural causes, anonymous posters vented about being asked to do too much and called for a walkout, which never materialized.\n\nBank of America has said its executives take junior bankers\u2019 health seriously and that the firm frequently reviews policies to ensure they\u2019re protected. As for how they log time, the firm said, \u201cour practice is clear and we expect employees to accurately record their hours.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nLong hours have always been a facet of Wall Street\u2019s training programs. But unlike the tsunami of activity junior bankers handled during the pandemic, the recent sense in the lower rungs is that much of the work is on spec, as bosses try to position their firms for an upswing, especially once interest rates fall.\n\nWith many desks just starting to see revenue increase, trainees have little leverage to demand better conditions. Peloton exercise bikes that some firms offered a few years ago are now gathering dust because, as a young banker at one boutique firm put it, nobody has time to use them anymore.\n\n\u201cThe culture in banking isn\u2019t keeping up with the times and needs of junior bankers,\u201d said Stephan Meier a professor at Columbia Business School. Instead, supervisors keep making the mistake of viewing trainees as resources to be used or wasted, he said.\n\n\u201cEither firms squeeze out as much as possible of their junior bankers, and that\u2019s good for the business, or if they don\u2019t, it hurts the performance of the organization,\u201d Meier said. \u201cThat\u2019s the wrong mindset.\u201d\n\nChest Pains\n\nFirms have bolstered safeguards and perks in recent years, such as ensuring some Saturdays off or providing free fitness classes. Yet workloads haven\u2019t been curtailed to allow for it, employees said in interviews. That leaves them to argue with staffers or, worse, anger the more powerful bosses they need to impress.\n\nOne junior banker who left Lazard Inc. late last year said she couldn\u2019t bring herself to seek help, even as her health deteriorated. She felt pressure in her chest while working, Googled \u201cheart attack symptoms\u201d and contacted a medical hotline, which urged her to see a doctor. But she stayed at her desk, worried that if it were a false alarm, bosses would view a trip to a clinic as a poor excuse for blowing deadlines. Feeling worse months later, she quit to start a new career.\n\nA junior banker at another big bank said he also kept working while experiencing chest pain after gulping an energy drink to finish a 100-hour week. He thought about seeing a doctor, but everyone else on his team was pulling the same hours, and he didn\u2019t want to stand out as the one who couldn\u2019t hack it.\n\nA May survey by the social media platform Overheard on Wall Street found junior bankers are putting in an average of about 80 hours a week \u2014 equating to more than 11 hours a day including weekends \u2014 and sleeping about five hours a night. Yet some of the roughly 200 participants claimed to have notched 140-hour weeks, leaving only four hours a day for sleeping and other necessities.\n\nAsked to score their mental and physical health on a scale of 1 to 10, the average responses were 2 and 3, respectively, according to a copy of the results seen by Bloomberg.\n\nA question about the pressure on young bankers even made its way into JPMorgan\u2019s annual investor day last month. Jennifer Piepszak, co-head of commercial and investment banking, responded that nothing is more important than the well-being of employees and that managers need to ensure that.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit in our offices and go through business reviews,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be out in the field and every one of us are, so that we have a sense of where the pressure might be mounting, and we need to give people the resources to be able to cope.\u201d\n\nStaffer Conflicts\n\nAt many banks, the role of staffer has existed for decades. They appear in Michael Lewis\u2019 Liar\u2019s Poker, portraying life at Salomon Brothers in the high-flying 1980s, and in John Rolfe and Peter Troob\u2019s Monkey Business, chronicling young bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette during the dot-com bubble.\n\nThough many staffers are mere vice presidents \u2014 near the bottom of the management tree \u2014 banks typically ask them to ensure higher-ups don\u2019t demand too much from new arrivals. Indeed, a staffer at a bulge-bracket bank said she requested the job so she could help protect junior bankers after her own training at boutique Houlihan Lokey was so rigorous that she began bringing a sleeping bag to the office.\n\nStill, several junior bankers interviewed by Bloomberg described their staffers as clearly conflicted \u2014 more eager to impress rainmakers and climb the ladder than to push back.\n\nA Citigroup employee said that he kept telling his staffer that his weekly hours were surpassing the 100 that the bank\u2019s software would let him log \u2014 only to be told that everyone was stretched and that the deals still needed to get done.\n\n\u2018Selling Your Soul\u2019\n\nStrolling around Manhattan, it\u2019s easy to find signs of Wall Street\u2019s intense treatment of trainees.\n\nA young man was seen doing push-ups on Park Avenue\u2019s sidewalk Thursday, sweating through his dress clothes with the sun overhead. Asked what was happening, he said he was being punished by his boss for screwing up a pitch deck.\n\nFor those who stick with it, the goal remains a high-paying career. At investment banks, such lucre may not be quite as abundant as when formal training programs were set up as a gateway into private partnerships. But the experience is still valuable, with many junior bankers soon defecting to private equity or money management.\n\n\u201cGoing into banking, you are making the conscious decision of giving up your lifestyle,\u201d said Hamilton Lin, co-founder of Wall Street Training & Advisory. \u201cYou are selling your soul to the devil, but it\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d",
        "summary": "To see the stress mounting again on Wall Street\u2019s junior bankers, just look a half-rung higher, at staffers.\nBank of America has said its executives take junior bankers\u2019 health seriously and that the firm frequently reviews policies to ensure they\u2019re protected.\n\u201cThe culture in banking isn\u2019t keeping up with the times and needs of junior bankers,\u201d said Stephan Meier a professor at Columbia Business School.\nA question about the pressure on young bankers even made its way into JPMorgan\u2019s annual investor day last month.\nBut the experience is still valuable, with many junior bankers soon defecting to private equity or money management.",

        "body": "The Supreme Court today overruled a decades-old decision that let judges defer to a regulator\u2019s interpretation of complex statutes, so long as the court deemed the interpretation reasonable.\n\nThe decision in Loper Bright Enterprises et al v. Raimondo, Secretary of Commerce came by a vote of 6-3. It is not retroactive.\n\nJustices wrote in the decision, referring to the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies handle regulations, that it \u201crequires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent U.S. agency responsible for consumer protection, tells Fortune they are reviewing the decision.\n\nWhile the decision whether to overturn the 1984 case Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council will take years to fully evaluate, the banking sector is certainly to be among the hardest hit, with agencies including the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau all likely scrambling to see how it will impact them.\n\nA statement from Lindsey Johnson, CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, an advocate of lighter regulation, jumped at the chance to blame regulatory overreach for the decision, adding that what it characterized as a \u201chistoric decision\u201d will take \u201cyears to unfold across not just the financial regulatory landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe would not be at this point today if government agencies were more prudent and consistent about staying within their statutory authorities, grounding their rule makings in empirical facts, and heeding appropriate procedural safeguards,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cInstead, too frequently, our regulators appear to be chasing headlines and short-term political wins.\u201d\n\nRob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, released a statement saying his advocacy group for small-, medium- and large-size banks was still reviewing the full implications of of the decision, but he took a similar stance to the CBA\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe ruling sends a crystal-clear message to federal agencies that their powers are not unlimited,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is an important win for accountability and predictability at a time when agencies are unleashing a tsunami of regulation\u2014in many cases clearly exceeding their statutory authority while making it harder for banks to serve their customers. We will continue to fight to ensure that bank regulators follow the law every time they exercise their powers.\u201d\n\nThe CBA statement further says it expects that agency actions that \u201clack a clear delegation of authority from Congress\u201d will be increasingly easy to defeat in legal battles as a result of today\u2019s decision.\n\nIn February 2020 New Jersey\u2013based Loper Bright Enterprises filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that an ambiguously worded act providing management for some U.S. fisheries does not give the National Marine Fisheries Service the right to require onboard monitoring of its vessels. The case ended up going before the Supreme Court this January.\n\n____________________\n\nThis story has been updated with a response from the CFPB and additional background on the case.",

        "body": "The board of Thames Water agreed to pay a \u00a3150m dividend hours before its shareholders U-turned on plans to pump emergency funding into the struggling water supplier, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe water industry regulator was examining the decision by the debt-laden company\u2019s board to sign off the payout at a meeting on 27 March, sources said.\n\nThe following day, the company said an imminent \u00a3500m injection of funds that had been pledged by its investors would not be paid, amid a standoff with Ofwat. That decision threatens to tip Britain\u2019s water company into public hands, with Whitehall officials war-gaming its temporary renationalisation.\n\nOfwat planned to investigate the circumstances around the dividend paid by Thames, sources said. At the time, Thames was already under investigation over its decision to pay a separate \u00a337.5m dividend.\n\nThames Water\u2019s fate is one of the biggest issues facing the next government, with the company labouring under \u00a315.6bn of debt, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse.\n\nThames said it was too early to know what the outcome of Ofwat\u2019s inquiries into the dividend payment would be.\n\nThe company, which has a complex corporate structure, said the payment was made from the regulated company to an intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, to \u201csettle a pension top-up payment\u201d and \u201csurrender relief\u201d on tax losses.\n\nIn March the company and its shareholders drew heavy criticism when investors refused to pay \u00a3500m of promised funding. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said the leadership of the company had been a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\n\nIn December the Guardian revealed that Ofwat was examining a \u00a337.5m dividend paid from its regulated operating company to its ultimate owner, Kemble.\n\nWhile the \u00a3150m payout did not go to Thames shareholders, Ofwat has been clamping down on the flow of cash from ringfenced water companies to holding companies, amid concerns that payouts are weakening the finances of regulated water and sewerage firms.\n\nIn May 2023 it modified the conditions of water companies\u2019 licences to stipulate that companies must explain how dividend decisions were made and how they \u201creflect overall performance, alongside investment and financial resilience needs\u201d. The regulator can take action where a company has failed to meet the conditions.\n\nThis month it emerged that Ofwat was considering fining the company \u00a340m over the \u00a337.5m payment on the grounds that it breached those rules on dividends. Sources close to the situation said a final decision on that possible fine was unlikely to be published before the regulator rules on water companies\u2019 five-year spending plans next month.\n\nOfwat is due to publish its draft response to water companies\u2019 business plans on 11 July, after a delay caused by the general election. Thames\u2019s annual results need to be published by 15 July.\n\nThe company, which serves about 16m households, faces the prospect of a potential special administration, handled by the government, if it cannot raise fresh funds from investors.

These transactions were cash and reserves neutral for Thames Water Utilities Limited, which is the regulated business, and increased the company\u2019s financial resilience.\n\n\u201cOfwat does not assert any potential breach by Thames Water of its licence and it is too early to know the outcome of Ofwat\u2019s enquiries in relation to this matter.\u201d\n\nThames said its ultimate shareholders, which include the Canadian pension fund Omers and the British university staff pension scheme USS, had not received a dividend since 2017 and it did not plan an \u201cexternal dividend\u201d until 2030.\n\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cWe await the company to disclose its financial report including any dividend. We have new powers to act against companies paying dividends that do not reflect companies\u2019 performance for customers and the environment or which compromise financial resilience, and we will use them as appropriate.\u201d\n\nA downgrade by the credit ratings agencies Moody\u2019s and S&P in April meant Thames Water could not pay dividends without breaching its licence.\n\nThe water industry has faced mounting anger from politicians and the public over repeated sewage spills into Britain\u2019s waterways during a period in which it has made significant payments to investors and handed executives large bonuses.",

In one internal email, a PMJ employee claimed they had been told \u201cto keep it a secret\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Philip Morris's IQOS devices at a shop in Tokyo. A tobacco industry watchdog said PMI appeared to have lobbied for IQOS to be permitted where smoking was banned. Photograph: Akio Kon/Getty\n\nThe paper, published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, is based on 24 leaked company documents, dated from between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThese activities resemble known strategies to influence the conduct, publication and reach of science, and conceal scientific activities,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nDr Sophie Braznell, one of its authors, said: \u201cThe manipulation of science for profit harms us all, especially policymakers and consumers trying to make potentially life-changing decisions. It slows down and undermines public health policies, while encouraging the widespread use of harmful products.\u201d\n\nBraznell said the leaked documents undermined claims made by PMI to conduct \u201ctransparent science\u201d, and called for reforms to the funding and governance of tobacco research \u201cto protect science from vested corporate interests\u201d.\n\nIn a separate report on the company\u2019s marketing activities, also based on leaked documents, Stop said PMJ appeared to lobby for IQOS to be permitted in places where smoking was banned.\n\nGroups including medical and hospitality groups, and Japan\u2019s Fire and Disaster Management Agency were all targeted for endorsements, \u201cwhich, if secured, could give the appearance of organic, widespread acceptance of IQOS\u201d, Stop said.\n\nAiming for a presence at the Tokyo Olympics \u201cechoes a known industry tactic of advertising addictive, harmful tobacco products at sports events \u2013 associating these products with health, misleading consumers, and reaching children and young people\u201d.\n\nJorge Alday, director at Stop, said the findings were at odds with PMI\u2019s statements suggesting IQOS was only targeted at adult smokers.\n\n\u201cPMI\u2019s intentions with IQOS seem to extend far beyond what they\u2019ve stated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis revelation adds weight to the mounting evidence questioning the credibility of PMI\u2019s claims about their intentions and their products.\n\n\u201cDisturbingly, it hints at a broader pattern of deceptive tactics, potentially laying the groundwork for a new chapter in the tobacco epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nA PMI spokesperson said: \u201cThis is yet another specious story from an organisation more interested in criticising our company than helping reduce the harm from cigarettes.\n\n\u201cLike any highly regulated, multinational company, PMI regularly seeks to share our positions on issues that affect our consumers, our company, and our communities.

        "body": "Uber and Lyft drivers will be guaranteed among the highest wages in the US for ride-share workers under a historic deal agreed with Massachusetts prosecutors.\n\nAndrea Campbell, the state\u2019s attorney general, and the two companies agreed to a $175m settlement Thursday evening that requires a minimum pay floor of $32.50 per hour, and introduces a slew of other benefits and protections that drivers didn\u2019t already have.\n\nThe resolution to four years of litigation between the parties also resulted in a settlement of $174m to be paid by the companies: $148m from Uber and $27m from Lyft. Most will be distributed as restitution to current and former drivers who were underpaid by the companies. More information about who will qualify for those payments and how to file a claim will be released in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cFor years, these companies have underpaid their drivers and denied them basic benefits,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement holds Uber and Lyft accountable and provides their drivers, for the very first time in Massachusetts, guaranteed minimum pay, paid sick leave, occupational accident insurance and healthcare stipends.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts now joins New York, Minnesota, Washington, and other states in setting a minimum pay rate for drivers.\n\nDrivers will also benefit from access to paid sick leave if they work 15 hours weekly, as well as a stipend for health benefits and occupational accident insurance. They can accrue up to 40 hours annually of paid sick leave, which will be bought through stipends to buy into the state\u2019s program for paid family and medical leave.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft don\u2019t intend to pull out of Massachusetts and operations will continue. The changes will go into effect on 15 August and will be adjusted annually for inflation.\n\nEd Booth has been driving for Lyft for over seven years. He said he usually makes a lot more than the new floor for wages, but it depends on what hours he works and whether there\u2019s a surge of customers \u2013 like at 2am when youth leave closing bars.\n\n\u201cThen all of a sudden, you\u2019ll get all this cash windfall that will bring your average back up to somewhere around $40, $45,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described himself as an independent guy who has owned many businesses, including a current one in web development. \u201cI\u2019ve been treating this like my own business,\u201d he said, adding that he doesn\u2019t want any union involvement in the future.\n\n\u201cYou know, the health insurance, I\u2019m gonna take advantage of it,\u201d he said. He\u2019s \u201ca little bit\u201d concerned that many new drivers will sign up to take advantage of the hourly floor, creating more competition, but he\u2019s confident enough to handle it.\n\nJeremy Bird, Lyft executive vice president of driver experience, called the moment a \u201chuge win for Massachusetts drivers that secures their freedom to earn when, where and however long they want\u201d. He said on any given day, the flexible work on the Lyft platform provides an average of 8,500 drivers in Massachusetts independence to earn while attending school and caring for families.\n\nUber media relations referred the Guardian to a blogpost where Tony West, Uber chief legal officer, wrote that the agreement is \u201can example of what independent, flexible work with dignity should look like in the 21st century\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn taking this opportunity, we\u2019ve resolved historical liabilities by constructing a new operating model that balances both flexibility and benefits,\u201d West said.\n\nThe accord doesn\u2019t take a stance on the classification of drivers, allowing them to continue to act as contractors.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He often works 30 hours between Friday to Sunday as a driver.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, a massive victory for drivers. That delivers real advancements in terms of an earnings guarantee in terms of paid sick leave, health care and other important basic protections of employment law,\u201d he said. But he\u2019s disappointed because Campbell\u2019s office didn\u2019t \u201cpursue enforcement of the law here. There\u2019s no ruling on employment status.\u201d\n\nDrivers will be paid the minimum of $32.50, and will be able to make more \u2013 the wage will apply for when drivers are en route to pick up passengers or transporting them. Some drivers complained that the companies won\u2019t be required to pay for the time when they\u2019ve logged onto their apps, but haven\u2019t chosen a customer\u2019s ride request.\n\n\u201cBy setting the amount at $32.50, we were trying to account for the time the driver\u2019s are waiting as well,\u201d said Abby Taylor, Massachusetts deputy attorney general, who worked on the case.\n\nFor health insurance, drivers will be offered a \u201cpooled health insurance benefit\u201d for anyone who drives more than 15 hours per week, boiling down to an insurance stipend to pay for a plan through the state\u2019s health connector.\n\nThe agreement also allows an appeals process for drivers to push back on deactivations.\n\nThen attorney general, Maura Healey, who is now governor, launched the lawsuit in 2020, alleging the ride share companies were boosting their profits by treating drivers as contractors and denying them benefits that employees would receive.\n\n\u201cOur lawsuit against Uber and Lyft was always about fairness for drivers,\u201d she said Thursday night in a statement, calling the wages \u201chistoric\u201d and a benefit to \u201cright the wrongs of the past\u201d.",

        "title": "Labour\u2019s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation",
        "body": "As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss\u2019s government and its \u201cdash for growth\u201d in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.\n\nBuoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.\n\nIn short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy\u2019s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.\n\nThere is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.\n\nThe Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.\n\nLabour has indicated it would try to \u201chardwire\u201d many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt \u201crule\u201d as the current Conservative party.\n\nThe challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.\n\nOne must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nAnother, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country\u2019s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Grand corporate strategies are launched in weighty declarations by chief executives who fancy themselves as visionaries. That was how Bernard Looney, the then chief executive of BP, did it back in February 2020 when he said the company would get serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewables. \u201cThe direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back,\u201d Looney told his City audience.\n\nBy contrast, the watering down of ambition tends to happen in increments. Thus, when Looney last year scrapped BP\u2019s aim to reduce hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030, versus 2019\u2019s level, in favour of a 25% cut, he claimed the change was a case of \u201cleaning in\u201d to the same strategy, just in the new circumstance of a world that was worrying more about energy security after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnd now comes today\u2019s BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, with his own adjustment. This one is genuinely more of a tweak: BP will slow its investment in low-carbon projects, which mostly means offshore wind in this case. The intention \u2013 at least for now \u2013 is still to complete the 9.5GW of capacity in unbuilt off-shore projects in the UK, Germany and the US. But don\u2019t expect to see BP turbine blades start spinning until late in this decade, and don\u2019t expect the company to bid for more wind licences unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. The corporate game is now about delivering \u201ca simpler, more focused and higher value company\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chevron and ExxonMobil in the US, for example, are unembarrassed about their determination to be oily for longer. And BP is the only major to have a formal target to reduce oil and gas output. It is why Auchincloss can still maintain that his refrain about moving from \u201cIOC to IEC\u201d \u2013 from international oil company to integrated energy company \u2013 is intact.\n\nYet his next action will be the one to watch. The stock market, as everybody knows by now, is rewarding the US titans with higher share ratings because they have an easier financial story to tell: energy transition globally is happening at a slower pace than imagined a few years ago, and their expertise lies in oil and gas, where immediate demand is still high.\n\nBP, by contrast, is in \u201ctrust us\u201d financial territory for what it calls its \u201cfive transition growth engines\u201d, which also include biogas, electric vehicle charging points, hydrogen and \u2013 nonsensically \u2013 convenience stores on forecourts. Since it hasn\u2019t actually built any windfarms yet, it is not in position to demonstrate achieved returns. Therein lies its credibility issue with the market.\n\nSo where does Auchincloss go next? As the continuity choice for the top job, radical change was never on the cards in year one. But you have to wonder what year two will bring. Would anyone be surprised if BP\u2019s renewables ambitions were scaled back again? Increments add up, and Looney\u2019s \u201cno turning back\u201d mantra feels a long time ago.",

        "title": "Brexit may have felt absent from this election \u2013 but it will still define it | Larry Elliott",
        "body": "It is one of the oddities of this weirdest of election campaigns that the issue that helped give the Conservatives an 80-seat majority in 2019 has barely been mentioned. As far as the main parties are concerned, Brexit is a done deal. The decision has been made. Time to move on.\n\nTo be sure, much has happened since 2019, most notably a global pandemic, a cost of living crisis and the brief \u2013 yet drama-packed \u2013 premiership of Liz Truss. Making ends meet features more prominently in voters\u2019 lists of concerns than whether the UK should rejoin the single market.\n\nEven so, the fact that the UK left the EU since the last election matters. It matters because Brussels can no longer be blamed for the UK\u2019s problems or the failure of UK politicians to deal with them. The EU can\u2019t, for example, be fingered for record net migration numbers in 2022. Those are entirely due to decisions taken at Westminster. The likely scale of the Conservative defeat on 4 July will be the result of voters holding the government fully to account for rising prices, falling living standards and a failure to deliver on levelling up. There is no hiding place, and that\u2019s good. Many of those who voted leave in 2016 because they felt ignored and marginalised still feel ignored and marginalised. They gave the Tories a chance and they blew it.\n\nFrom next week, they will almost certainly be able to see whether Labour can make a better fist of things. Keir Starmer has been on quite a journey since he was the shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, pressing for a second referendum. He has not just ruled out rejoining the EU but has also said there will be no return to the single market or the customs union. Instead, Labour wants to smooth out the wrinkles by negotiating a better trade deal with the EU than the one Boris Johnson secured.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Starmer\u2019s fellow MPs and Labour party supporters have come on that journey with him, because for the most part they are solidly anti-Brexit and pro-EU. That has not always been the case, and there was a time in the 1970s and early 1980s when, under Tony Benn\u2019s influence, Labour was the more Eurosceptic of the two main parties.\n\nBut after Labour\u2019s drubbing at the 1983 election there was then a shift towards a more pro-EU stance amid hopes that Brussels-style socialism offered a way to circumvent the policies of Margaret Thatcher. To say the least, the party is not entirely comfortable with Starmer\u2019s decision to rule out rejoining the EU.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit strategy was summed up by Starmer on one of the few occasions the issue has surfaced during the campaign \u2013 a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson. \u201cIf you look at the problems for growth over the last 14 years, they were there, or many of them were there, before Brexit, so the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept.\u201d\n\nStarmer is right about this. The parts of the country that voted most strongly for leave were those that saw the sharpest rises in unemployment in the 1980s and the biggest increases in incapacity benefits as attempts were made to massage the jobless figures down. They had the heaviest reliance on the tax credits to top up poverty pay, and they bore the brunt of the welfare cuts introduced by George Osborne after 2010.\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted, progress towards the 2030 levelling up goals set in a 2022 white paper has been \u201cglacial\u201d and in some areas the UK has gone backwards.\n\nPolitical developments on the other side of the Channel are helpful to Starmer, because he can point out to his critics that the EU is not exactly a haven of contentment and prosperity, and hasn\u2019t been for some time.\n\nThere is some irony in the fact that the left\u2019s love affair with Europe began in the 1980s at a time when the EU\u2019s economic performance took a marked turn for the worse. Then in the 90s, the single currency was supposed to deliver faster growth and greater shared prosperity. Instead, as the growing support for populist parties shows all too clearly, monetary union has been accompanied by economic stagnation and rising inequality.\n\nVoters in the UK\u2019s industrial heartlands are not the only ones who feel marginalised and ignored: the same sentiments are widespread in struggling parts of Germany and France, particularly among young voters. Starmer may find that improving trade links with the UK is not top of the EU\u2019s list of priorities.\n\nInstead, the pressure is on him to use all the tools at his disposal \u2013 tax, procurement, state aid, nationalisation, subsidies, skills, control of migration \u2013 as part of an activist industrial strategy designed to boost growth and narrow regional divides. This was what those on the left who supported Brexit called for in 2016 and there is now even more of a need for such a strategy.\n\nDoubtless, some will say a Brexit growth strategy is an oxymoron. Others will say \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that Labour\u2019s growth strategy is too small to make a difference. Some may even be quietly hoping for Labour to come a cropper because it will ease the way to rejoining the EU. But there is no real difference between Labour\u2019s growth strategy and its Brexit strategy. If one fails then so does the other.",

        "title": "Things are not going to get better as long as oligarchs rule the roost in our democracies | George Monbiot",
        "body": "We are about to return to normal politics. After 14 years of Tory corruption and misrule, a Labour government will put this country back on track. Justice and decency will resume, public services will be rebuilt, our global standing will be restored, we will revert to a familiar state. Or so the story goes.\n\nWhat is the \u201cnormal\u201d envisaged by pundits and politicians of the left and centre? It is the most anomalous politics in the history of the world. Consciously or otherwise, they hark back to a remarkable period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich nations, wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to decent housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious and well-funded and a robust economic safety net prevented destitution. There had never been a period like it in the prior history of the world, and there has not been one since. Even during that period, general prosperity in the rich nations was supported by extreme exploitation, coups and violence imposed on the poor nations. We lived in a bubble, limited in time and space, in which extraordinary things happened. Yet somehow we think of it as normal.\n\nThose \u201cnormal\u201d politics were the result of something known to economic historians as the \u201cgreat compression\u201d: a drastic reduction in inequality caused by two world wars. In many powerful countries, a combination of the physical destruction of assets, the loss of colonial and overseas possessions, inflation, very high taxes, wage and price controls, requisitioning and nationalisation required by the wartime economy, as well as the effects of rising democracy and labour organisation, greatly reduced the income and assets of the rich. It also greatly improved, once the wars had ended, the position of the poor. For several decades, we benefited from the aftermath of these great shocks. Now the effect has faded. We are returning to true \u201cnormality\u201d.\n\nThe history of many centuries, including our own, shows that the default state of politics is not redistribution and general welfare, but a spiral of accumulation by the very rich, the extreme exploitation of labour, the seizure of common resources and exaction of rent for their use, extortion, coercion and violence. Normal is a society in which might is right. Normal is oligarchy.\n\nIn his magisterial book The Great Leveler, published in 2017, the historian Walter Scheidel explains that only four forces have ever significantly reversed inequality: mass-mobilisation warfare (such as the two world wars), total and violent revolution, state collapse and devastating plagues. Decisions, decisions.\n\nHe shows how warfare economies have been turned into welfare economies, sometimes by force. For example, following the defeat of Japan, the US occupation government, led by General Douglas MacArthur, sought what it called \u201cthe democratization of Japanese economic institutions\u201d to ensure \u201ca wide distribution of income and ownership of the means of production and trade\u201d. To this end, it imposed high property taxes, with a top marginal rate of 90%; broke up business conglomerates; demanded a labour union law enabling the right to organise and strike, and higher wages for workers; organised comprehensive land reform, which dissolved large holdings and distributed them to peasants; and introduced fiscal reform that led eventually to taxes on the highest incomes of 75% and an inheritance tax on the largest estates of 70%. These programmes resulted in the near-total destruction of income from capital and the creation in Japan of a political and economic democracy, almost from scratch.\n\nAll the major combatants were similarly transformed. In the US, the top rate of estate (inheritance) tax rose to 71% in 1941, and income tax to 94% in 1944. The National War Labor Board raised workers\u2019 pay while holding down executive pay. Union membership soared. In the UK, the top rate of income tax was held at 98% from 1941 to 1952. It took decades to decline to current levels. A purchase tax on luxury goods was introduced in 1940, with rates that later rose to 100%. The share of incomes captured by the richest 0.1% fell from 7% in 1937 to just over 1% in 1975.\n\nIn the absence of one of the four great catastrophes, income and capital inexorably accumulate in the hands of the few, and oligarchy returns. Oligarchs are people who translate their inordinate economic power into inordinate political power. They build a politics that suits them. Scheidel shows that as inequality rises, so does polarisation and political dysfunction, both of which favour the very rich, as a competent, proactive state is a threat to their interests. Dysfunction is what the Tories delivered and Donald Trump promises.\n\nOligarchs seek the destruction of oversight, which is why UK bodies such as the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive have been comprehensively gutted. The same desire was the driving force behind Brexit. They want the cessation of protest. They want a failing NHS, to justify privatisation. They want malleable politicians and a tame BBC. They get what they want, distorting every aspect of national life. They pour money into neoliberal and far-right political movements, which help capital to solve its perennial problem: democracy. The arc of history bends towards injustice. But every so often it is broken over the knee of catastrophe.\n\nIf you want a return to the rich nations\u2019 \u201cnormality\u201d of 1945 to 1975 \u2013 in other words, to redistribution, a shared sense of national purpose, robust public services and a strong economic safety net, high employment and good wages \u2013 and I think most people would, you need a politics that is not just abnormal, but unprecedented. Snapping the arc of injustice would mean going way beyond Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 2019 manifesto, let alone Keir Starmer\u2019s limp offering, which treads so carefully around the interests of the rich. We would need to do what the world wars did, without the violence and physical destruction: a peacetime MacArthur programme for overthrowing the oligarchs.\n\nPolitical parties would need to overcome their fear of economic power: of the newspaper barons, the property developers, the fossil fuel companies, hedge funds, private equity bosses and assorted oligarchs who now fund and influence our politics. The longer we leave this confrontation, the more extreme and entrenched oligarchic power becomes. If we want even a modicum of democracy, equality, fairness and a functioning state, we need not the accommodation with economic power that Starmer seeks, but the mother of all battles with it.",

Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of \u00a3100 \u2013 reduced to \u00a360 if paid within 14 days.\n\nHowever, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.\n\nThe AA\u2019s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: \u201cThis self-authored code doesn\u2019t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees \u2026 These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.\u201d\n\nThe code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.\n\nIt also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an \u201cappeals charter\u201d for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.\n\nParking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.\n\nPoliticians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses \u2013 which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year \u2013 for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.\n\nA bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to \u00a350, among a number of other measures.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "I wanted to draw your, and your readers\u2019, attention to something I think is extremely sharp practice by the insurance broker Collingwood.\n\nI bought its annual learner driver policy for my son last year for \u00a3256.\n\nCollingwood was clear that once he passed his driving test the policy would cease to be valid, which I understood.\n\nIn fact, it took my son almost the whole year before he passed, with only a few weeks of the policy left to run.\n\nI was content to let it expire, in the knowledge that no partial refund would be due.\n\nI was then very surprised to receive an email informing me that, since my son had passed his test, I now owed Collingwood a \u00a340 \u201ccancellation fee\u201d.\n\nI knew, in practice, no claim could now be made on it. I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.\n\nI see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging \u00a340 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.\n\nML, by email\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.\n\nIt is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge \u2013 one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.\n\nI asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.\n\n\u201cThe fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWith reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.\u201d\n\nIf everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this \u00a340 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The wrapper contains information related to the manufacturer\u2019s identity and country-specific information in different languages, CPSC added.\n\nAccording to the CPSC, the resins contain acrylates, a chemical agent made from acrylic acid, in amounts prohibited in children\u2019s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. After the resins harden, they no longer pose a risk.\n\nMGA Entertainment has received 26 reports of incidents with this product affecting children and adults. Those include reports of burns and irritation, respiratory irritation, as well as one report of a consumer\u2019s asthma being triggered.\n\nIn addition to the toy sets being recalled across the US, there are 1m recalls that have been issued across Canada.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the MGA Entertainment CEO, Isaac Larian, said that the product had been on the market for 18 months and that only 10% to 15% of the recalled products contain liquid resin.\n\nFrom October 2022 through June 2024, the sets, which were manufactured in China and ranged in price from $7 to $13, were sold at Target, Walmart, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Aldi and Hobby Lobby, in addition to other stores and Amazon.com. Some sets were also sold in a box ranging in price from $14 to $52.\n\nIn an FAQ document posted online, MGA Entertainment said that the remedy upon returning a recalled set with unused resin is the consumer\u2019s choice of a replacement product or a refund. MGA Entertainment also said it will pay for return shipping labels.\n\nThe Guardian has reached out to MGA Entertainment for comment.",

        "body": "1. Find your demographic\n\nThe competition is stiff, so finding the right place to sell your clothes will give you the best chance of getting them in front of people who might want to buy them.\n\n\u201cDepop tends to appeal more to gen Z, so it doesn\u2019t really suit the pieces I\u2019m selling, while Vinted has a wide range of buyers of all ages,\u201d says Becky Barnes, a sustainable stylist. \u201cOne of my most successful places for selling shoes and clothes is the local community Facebook page. As a seller, it\u2019s easier because you don\u2019t have to package up and send things \u2013 people almost always want to collect.\u201d\n\n2. Provide clear photos\n\nWhether you show an item on a hanger, or post pictures of you wearing the garment, try to get a selection of clear photos from different angles, with closeups of the fabric, and include a shot of the label and care instructions.\n\nTake them in lighting that shows them as they really are \u2013 Natacha Blanchard from Vinted recommends putting clothes against a white background so their outline is clear.\n\nKirsty Keoghan, global general manager of fashion at eBay, says people selling items on the site can use its background removal tool to create a more attractive image, and its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sellers on eBay can use its its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\n3. Be descriptive and honest\n\nUse more keywords than you think you need \u2013 this will help buyers find your items when they search.\n\nBlanchard says: \u201cSometimes the colour does not appear in the photo as it does in real life, so I always pay attention to that.\u201d If it is not possible to take photos in good lighting that shows the true colours, she will point out on the description that the shade is lighter or darker than it looks.\n\nAlways be clear about sizing, too. If something comes up smaller or larger than you would expect, mention it. \u201cInclude your basic measurements \u2013 height, bust, waist and hips \u2013 so people can immediately tell if something will fit,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cIt does take a bit more time, but it\u2019s worth getting the tape measure out and including those key measurements so that people are understanding what they are buying.\u201d\n\nIf there are any defects, scratches or snags, mention these in your post, and include pictures of those parts. \u201cI always try to think about selling as if I were buying \u2013 what would I need to know about an item, what information would I want to see?\u201d says Blanchard.\n\n4. Get the timing right\n\nThink seasonally. \u201cAt this time of year, I would be thinking about selling summer dresses and things that suit the season. In October it would be coats and warmer clothing,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nIf you have had a clearout and really want to shift things quickly, be prepared to go low on prices or you may find it difficult to sell.\n\nThe timing of your post counts, too \u2013 holding off and posting when buyers are actively browsing can ensure your listing appears high on the page and gets more views.\n\n\u201cWe know more people are actively listing on Saturdays, and people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nView image in fullscreen An expert from Vinted says people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays. Photograph: mundissima/Alamy\n\n5. Drip-feed your stock\n\nAfter a wardrobe cull, it can be tempting to put everything online immediately. Instead, it is wise to post a few things each day.\n\nKatie Rowe, who sells clothes on Depop, says: \u201cI post every day to be as consistent as I can to maximise my exposure.\u201d\n\nBarnes agrees: \u201cIf I had 10 items, I wouldn\u2019t upload all in one go to the same platform. I would add two or three a day, every day, just to try to keep myself at the top of the algorithm.\u201d\n\n6. Use bundles and discounts\n\nOn sites such as Vinted and Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items from you.\n\nYou get to choose the percentage you would like to take off when you set up your account. It is attractive to the buyer because, on top of the discount, they will pay less for postage.\n\n\u201cI sometimes make bundle offers through the Depop app, meaning that if a buyer buys two or more items, they can get a percentage off the final price,\u201d says Amber Ramon, a regular seller on Depop.\n\nView image in fullscreen On Depop and Vinted, Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\n7. Be friendly in negotiations\n\nOnline selling frequently requires interaction with buyers.\n\n\u201cVinted, and other platforms, are about individuals, and if you list on Vinted, you have to be ready to engage. Potential buyers might have lots of questions,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cBe prepared for negotiations \u2013 people will try to buy for less. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\n8. Pack and ship well\n\nPack items carefully and make sure they are protected. \u201cSome people like to be creative with their packaging,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cThat can range from packing really carefully to including a little note when sending items. Everyone has their own approach.\u201d\n\nWhatever yours is, be prompt with packing and sending. If you have happy customers, they may return to your page. But perhaps, more importantly, they will give you positive feedback, which will reassure subsequent buyers that you are trustworthy.\n\nView image in fullscreen Be prompt with packing and sending to ensure you get good feedback on sites such as eBay. Photograph: Alisha Arif/Alamy\n\n9. Check selling fees\n\nListing items is often free on secondhand platforms: eBay recently removed fees for private sellers of pre-owned clothes (sellers and buyers must be in the UK), and many platforms charge buyers, rather than sellers.\n\nFor example, buyers pay a \u201cbuyer protection\u201d fee of between 3% and 8% of the pre-postage price on each Vinted purchase, plus between 30p and 80p.\n\nDepop has a marketplace fee of about 5% plus \u00a31, also charged to buyers. While it does not have a seller\u2019s fee per se, there is a processing charge for payments, the service through which payments are received. Sellers pay 2.9% of the sale price (including postage cost) plus 30p.\n\n10. Check tax requirements\n\nMost people will not have to pay tax on the items they sell online. However, as of January this year, HM Revenue and Customs has required online marketplaces and other \u201cdigital platforms\u201d to collect and report information on how much money their users make.\n\nWebsites in countries that have signed up to rules set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development must gather data on UK-resident sellers and share it with HMRC.\n\nTax experts and sites such as MoneySavingExpert.com say platforms will only report information to HMRC automatically if someone is selling 30 or more items a year, or makes more than the equivalent of \u20ac2,000 a year from this activity (a little under \u00a31,700 at the time of writing).\n\nSeparately, everyone has a trading allowance each tax year, which means they can earn up to \u00a31,000 without paying tax.\n\nHMRC has a tool that lets you check if there is anything you need to do.",

        "title": "Labour to seek \u2018stable position\u2019 with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate",
        "body": "Labour would rather have stability in the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU\u2019s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.\n\nAddressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been \u201cvery difficult for businesses\u201d because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.\n\nWith less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.\n\nSome business leaders and economists have said Labour\u2019s hopes to grow the economy \u2013 and thereby pay for improved public services \u2013 could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.\n\n\u201cYou could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.\u201d\n\nKemi Badenoch, Reynolds\u2019s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the \u201cpower of business to do good\u201d.\n\nHowever, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on \u201cmy favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics\u201d.\n\nBadenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy \u2013 an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May \u2013 was \u201cmorally repellent\u201d and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to \u201censhrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people\u201d as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.\n\nShevaun Haviland, the BCC\u2019s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d and try to improve the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that \u201cbusinesses don\u2019t want a renegotiation\u201d.\n\nAmanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that \u201can air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy\u201d and that some of the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.\n\nLabour\u2019s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party\u2019s relationship with business was \u201cone of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019\u201d.\n\nHe was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour\u2019s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.\u201d\n\nReynolds said he did not believe that Labour\u2019s changes would affect the company\u2019s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.\n\nDuring the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told by some commentators they don\u2019t think Labour\u2019s campaign is exciting enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, my friends, we\u2019re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we\u2019re not putting on politics as entertainment.\u201d",

        "body": "Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK\u2019s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nOfficials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said.\n\nBut it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.\n\n\u201cPolicy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,\u201d the Bank\u2019s financial stability report said. Questions over a country\u2019s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was \u201crelevant to UK financial stability\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.\n\nThat includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.\n\nIn total, about 3 million \u2013 or 35% \u2013 of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders \u2013 including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level \u2013 could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.\n\nThere are also concerns about the financial system\u2019s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.\n\n\u201cAlthough the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,\u201d the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.\n\nPolicymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK\u2019s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and \u201csevere\u201d economic shocks.\n\nThe first \u2013 a \u201csupply-shock scenario\u201d echoing the ripple effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.\n\nThe second \u201cdemand-shock scenario\u201d \u2013 which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns \u2013 assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.\n\nThis year\u2019s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

Labour and the Conservatives have been criticised for their reluctance to discuss how successful Brexit has been and future policies towards the EU.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month, Keir Starmer had to deny that he was scared of talking about the issue, instead saying he was determined to build a \u201ccloser, better\u201d relationship with the EU and improve Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cbotched deal\u201d.\n\nBusinesses have criticised the additional red tape and increased costs that Brexit has heaped on to firms importing and exporting goods to and from the continent.\n\nImporters of food and plants have been hit by charges associated with new Brexit border checks brought in at the end of April, with some logistics companies saying the changes have added up to 60% to transport costs.\n\nOther businesses have complained that the increasing divergence on standards, such as those around construction products, has made it more expensive for UK companies to get their products certified for sale on the continent.\n\nThe comments from Haviland come as the BCC makes improving relations with the EU one of its key requests for the next government, saying the step would reduce costs for businesses.\n\nThe trade body is made up of 53 regional chambers of commerce affiliated to a central body and says it represents 50,000 businesses in the UK, which collectively employ six million people.\n\nIts requests cover several specific policies, including securing a supplementary deal with the EU to remove the complexity of exporting food for small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensuring there are no new trade barriers created by linking the UK and EU emissions trading schemes.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "From 3d ago 10.52 CEST LGIM's ESG funds to divest from Glencore on concern over thermal coal plans Investment management giant Legal & General\u2019s ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, and some of its pension funds, are to divest from Glencore due to concerns over its coal production. LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM\u2019s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around \u00a3176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world\u2019s biggest coal shipper, is \u201cphasing down\u201d its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. \u2018Largest ever\u2019 NSW coalmine plan will put pressure on state\u2019s net zero target, watchdog says Read more Legal & General says: \u201cLGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.\u201d LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company\u2019s shares.

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles.

Today\u2019s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share\n\n3d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says \u201cthe recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected\u201d in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain\u2019s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect \u201crobust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation\u201d, Gruenwald explains. Share\n\n3d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached \u201cthe beginning of the end-game\u201d, as some \u2013 such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank \u2013 have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is \u201cjust the flipside\u201d of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want?

The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI\u2019s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).\n\nOrders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: \u201cLast month\u2019s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it\u2019s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it\u2019s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK\u2019s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.\u201d Share\n\n3d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX\u2019s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of \u201cmaterial Scope 3 emissions\u201d that fail to account for its material value chains\u2019 emissions. Today\u2019s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM\u2019s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this \u201cstewardship\u201d of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.\u201d Share",

        "body": "Air freight operators have increased their greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2019, analysis has found.\n\nIn 2023, air freight operators ran about 300,000 more flights than in 2019, an increase in flight volume of almost 30%. The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.\n\nDr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as \u201ca new climate and human health threat\u201d and urged air freight companies to \u201cend their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail\u201d.\n\nAir freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.\n\nThe researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon\u2019s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.\n\nThe researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.\n\nThe report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.\n\nBy 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall.

        "body": "With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.\n\nOn one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.\n\nThis increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\n\nAlarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.\n\nAlthough the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThese measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration\u2019s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe new US tariffs could extend beyond China\u2019s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.\n\nTo be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies \u2013 often in the form of cheap credit \u2013 have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.\n\nAdmittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.\n\nWith US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition \u2013 if we were to embrace it.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University.

        "body": "Your editorial rightly points out that GDP is not a good measure of how people are faring (19 June). As an alternative, you offer the UN\u2019s human development index. But we already have a better British alternative \u2013 the measure of life satisfaction in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 annual population survey.\n\nThe question asked is: \u201cOverall, how satisfied are you with your life these days (0: not at all satisfied, 10: completely)?\u201d The results are published every quarter. That is an excellent measure of the nation\u2019s success. It provides a good account of how we are doing on average and of the degree of fundamental inequality in our society.\n\nIt should become the objective of government policy to maximise wellbeing, measured in this way. As Thomas Jefferson said: \u201cThe life and happiness of the people ... is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\u201d And Keir Starmer has said that \u201cwith every pound spent on your behalf, we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on actual income but also its effect on wellbeing\u201d. So let us hope that the new government will judge all its policy options by their effects (per pound spent) on the life satisfaction of the population.\n\nProf Richard Layard\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nThe Guardian is correct to agree with the late Robert Kennedy, who said in 1968 that growth figures measured everything \u201cexcept that which makes life worthwhile\u201d. More than 50 years later, it is important to recognise that a thriving economy makes an important contribution to the UK\u2019s collective wellbeing. But GDP remains a poor measure of social progress. It measures criminal activity, but not caring responsibilities, and takes no account of the impact on public health or the planet.\n\nThat is why the next government should ground its decision-making in a wide range of statistics that measure our collective wellbeing. Ministers need to complement GDP data with a broad basket of figures about the reality of our lives and our impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, Carnegie\u2019s Life in the UK Index revealed yawning gaps in wellbeing between different groups in society. Only when similar datasets are used to underpin policymaking will governments have any hope of properly tackling the biggest problems of our time.\n\nSarah Davidson\n\nChief executive, Carnegie UK\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the public don\u2019t necessarily understand what GDP means, many politicians and journalists don\u2019t seem to know how GDP is calculated. As the economist Richard J Murphy has pointed out, \u201c10% of GDP is made up\u201d. When calculating GDP, the average cost of renting is used to figure out how much money owner-occupiers would be spending if they rented rather than owned their homes. This is called \u201cimputed rents\u201d and it accounts for around 10% of GDP.\n\nBut does it make sense to call rent a productive part of the economy? If all landlords raised their rents massively, this would appear on GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d, when in reality, no new goods or services would have been produced. It\u2019s the same with private equity \u2013 if a financial investor buys and then asset-strips a company, this will appear in GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d. But again, nothing has been produced, and therefore highly unproductive economic exchanges can appear in the GDP statistics as \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\nLooking at GDP in isolation is in practice about as useful as relying on the position of celestial bodies to tell you about your love life.\n\nEthan Oshoko\n\nSt Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex",

Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday.

In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.

        "body": "Britain\u2019s public finances are in a mess. Difficult decisions loom once the election is over. But the public is being kept in the dark about what might happen.\n\nThat, put briefly, was the gist of what the Institute for Fiscal Studies had to say about the Conservative and Labour party manifestos. The thinktank was also pretty dismissive about the plans of the smaller parties: the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Reform UK.\n\nThe IFS analysis is relatively simple. Debt as a share of national income is at its highest since the early 1960s. Taxes are close to the record level reached in the aftermath of the second world war. Spending has increased by more in the past five years than ever before under a Conservative government.\n\nYet, the thinktank says, public services \u2013 everything from the NHS to prisons \u2013 are visibly struggling. And fresh cuts of between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn will be on the way for unprotected Whitehall departments if the party elected on July 4 wants to reduce debt and avoid raising taxes.\n\nThe Conservative plan involves tax cuts of \u00a317bn, paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by cutting \u00a312bn from the welfare bill, mainly by slowing the increase in claims for disability benefit. The IFS says this equates to 1.6 million people losing an average of \u00a37,500 a year each, and would be politically hard to achieve.\n\nJudging by the opinion polls, there is no prospect of the Conservatives forming the next government and the only question is the scale of the party\u2019s defeat. Inevitably, the focus in the last week or so of the campaign will be on what Labour will do. The IFS is sceptical that faster than expected growth will lead to higher tax revenues and so spare Rachel Reeves from making tough choices.\n\nStronger growth would certainly help.

The last chancellor to run a primary surplus was Gordon Brown a quarter of a century ago.\n\nJohnson thinks it unlikely that Reeves will cut spending, which leaves the choice between tweaking the fiscal rules, raising taxes by more than already laid out in the manifesto, or both.

Share\n\n5d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. \u201cIt\u2019s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then\u201d, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. \u201cWe don\u2019t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,\u201d Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally\u2026 Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests\u2019 leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is \u201cvery much focused\u201d on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a \u201cquite exceptional\u201d job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month\u2019s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now \u201cterrified\u201d at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was \u201cno better job\u201d than Business and Trade Secretary, which \u201cis a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister\u201d. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats\u2026 would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before\u2026. That doesn\u2019t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid\u2026 and appears to leave the door open for one\u2026. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d situation; she doesn\u2019t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its \u00a315.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK\u2019s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share\n\n5d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer\u2026]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the \u201chighest standards\u201d on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers\u2019 homes, meaning they fall below the \u00a3135 threshold for import duty \u201cThat could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,\u201d Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share\n\n5d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What\u2019s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an \u201cobvious place to look for that\u201d money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and \u2018make the case\u2019 for investing in Britain. \u2018It won\u2019t take as long as people think\u2019: Rachel Reeves on being \u2018scrappy\u2019 \u2013 and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour\u2019s plans come from the \u201creasonable complaints\u201d of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn\u2019t know the country\u2019s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. \u201cWe will look again\u201d at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers \u2013 that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money\u2026. Share\n\n5d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven\u2019t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share\n\n5d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union \u2013 starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that \u2018relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they\u2019re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won\u2019t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don\u2019t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn\u2019t accept it. She insists the UK can\u2019t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share\n\n5d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it\u2019s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. \u201cThose are facts\u201d. Well\u2026.. this thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.\n\nWe'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.\n\nIt's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\nActually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that \"leapfrogging\" notion is wrong.\n\nIf anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.\n\nRaising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?\n\nBrexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.\n\nIf u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.\n\nFilm I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.\n\nEven tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest \"exports\" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.\n\nThe @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.\n\nAnd this is relevant.

Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum\u2026. Kemi Badenoch says she \u201ccompletely disagrees\u201d with IFS\u2019s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS\u2019s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS\u2026. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don\u2019t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says \u2013 and that\u2019s Labour\u2019s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won\u2019t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that\u2019s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs.

Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour\u2019s manifesto is \u201ca pro-worker, pro-business\u201d agenda, that \u2013 he says \u2013 has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that \u201cThe floor will rise\u201d, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it\u2019s businesses don\u2019t want these measures. She claims it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour\u2019s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are \u201cterrible regulations\u201d. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn\u2019t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won\u2019t accept this, telling business leaders they should be \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of \u201csurrendering\u201d your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are \u201cfishing in an empty barrel\u201d, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy.

        "body": "A Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules rather than cut spending in the event that stronger growth fails to rescue it from tough post-election choices, the head of a leading thinktank has said.\n\nPaul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the pressures on spending \u2013 including from public sector pay \u2013 were so powerful that he couldn\u2019t envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books.\n\nAsked at a press conference on the party manifestos what Labour would do in the event that growth is weaker than expected, Johnson said: \u201cThe pressure to change the fiscal rules or find more money from tax will be quite significant.\u201d\n\nThe IFS director said doctors were pushing for higher pay, teachers had faced a 25-year pay squeeze and civil servants\u2019 pay had been held down. \u201cThere are so many pressures on spending it is very hard for that to be the thing that gives.\u201d\n\nLabour has said it would stick to the current government\u2019s spending plans and meet the rule that debt should be declining as a share of national income after five years. It has announced modest tax rises to fund for additional spending on items such as hiring new teachers and increasing the number of dental appointments.\n\nThe IFS said both the main parties were ducking the hard choices that they would face after the election, leaving voters operating in a knowledge vacuum.\n\nAlthough he doubted whether Labour would cut spending, Johnson said that on the basis of the manifestos it was not known how the next government would respond to weaker than expected growth. \u201cIf taxes are to go up, we do not know which ones. We certainly don\u2019t know how they would respond if things were to get worse.\u201d\n\nIn a withering assessment, the IFS said neither manifesto recognised the pressure on the public finances caused by a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of low growth and the after-effects of the pandemic and the energy crisis.\n\nJohnson said: \u201cThe choices in front of us are hard. High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier. That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them.

As the population ages, these choices will become harder, not easier. We cannot wish them away,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson said commitments to improve the NHS were essentially unfunded promises and that a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d meant neither main party had made any serious proposals to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cDespite a (damaging) rush to rule out increases in all sorts of tax rates, it will be a considerable surprise if no other taxes are increased over the next five years. After all, they are currently much higher than was implied by the 2019 Conservative party manifesto.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the manifestos told voters more about what they wouldn\u2019t do than what they would. \u201cTax locks \u2013 pledges not to increase specific taxes or tax rates \u2013 aren\u2019t new. But this time, the parties have really gone to town. We\u2019ve seen something of a tax lock arms race,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThese tax locks are a mistake. They will constrain policy if a future government decides that it does in fact want to raise more money to fund public services.

        "body": "In 1944, the groundbreaking political economist Karl Polanyi published his radical magnum opus, The Great Transformation. In it, he accused influential liberal economists, including David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus, of commodifying human beings and the environment in the name of the free market.\n\nTheir Industrial Age ideas, he argued, ushered in the barbarism and poverty that came with 19th-century globalisation and unfettered capitalism, and this led, in the 20th century, to far-right and far-left backlashes against the movements of socialism, individualism and liberalism that followed.\n\nToday, The Great Transformation is lauded as a masterpiece and praised for its prescience by everyone from the former chief economist of the World Bank \u2013 the Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz \u2013 to shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and the French \u201crock star\u201d economist Thomas Piketty. Yet Polanyi\u2019s status as a Hungarian-Austrian foreigner of Jewish descent and the postwar popularity of Keynesian economics meant his book\u2019s prophetic insights were, for decades, rejected and neglected by mainstream academics and economists in Britain. Now, for the first time since the second world war, The Great Transformation has finally been published by a British publisher, with a new edition by Penguin Classics that came out last week.\n\n\u201cPolanyi is the most important thinker you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d said Penguin editor Hana Teraie-Wood. \u201cHe was one of the first heterodox economists and one of the first \u2013 perhaps even one of the founding \u2013 environmental economists. He\u2019s always been there, but he\u2019s just never had his time in the sun.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Album/Alamy\n\nBorn into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1886 and educated in Budapest, he was forced to flee Hungary by a proto-fascist regime in 1919, later becoming a prominent Christian socialist and journalist in Vienna. When Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 and fascism took off in Austria, he fled again, this time with his daughter to London, where he became a British citizen and eked out a living teaching part-time for the Workers\u2019 Educational Association. His lecture notes would prove the basis for The Great Transformation.\n\n\u201cHe conceived most of the ideas for the book when he was living in the UK, and it was predominantly about the history of capitalism in England \u2013 and yet no British publisher has really taken him on before,\u201d said Teraie-Wood. For years, he tried to get a job at a university in Britain, applying every\u00adwhere from Oxford to Hull. \u201cHe had fantastic references from luminaries of the intellectual left but he wasn\u2019t able to get the jobs that really, with his genius, he should have been a shoo-in for,\u201d said Dr Gareth Dale, an expert on Polanyi who wrote the introduction to the Penguin edition.\n\nHe added: \u201cI think there was some xenophobia and suspicion about him as an outsider, a foreigner with a funny-sounding name. There was probably prejudice, there was probably some antisemitism. And there was certainly some snobbery towards him. He should have walked into those jobs.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi. Photograph: Penguin Classics\n\nIn 1940, he was offered a fellowship at Bennington College in Vermont in the US and so emigrated there, where he wrote The Great Transformation and then took up a post at Columbia. \u201cLike other brilliant Jews who fled their homelands under the pogroms and pressures of antisemitism and fascism, Polanyi fetched up on British shores \u2013 only to then transplant to America,\u201d said Dale.\n\nPolanyi had observed that, in the 1930s, wealthy Germans who saw the Nazi party as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d against trade unions and socialists were persuaded to overlook Hitler\u2019s antisemitism because it allowed the market system to flourish, Dale said. \u201cIn the same way that a lot of Americans who find Trump distasteful today will still vote for him, a lot of German elites said to themselves: we\u2019re quite happy funding Hitler because his street fighters will help crush the trade unions, so that we can make more profits.\u201d\n\nPolanyi lost friends and relatives in the war, including his younger sister in the Holocaust. \u201cThe whole book is, in a sense, about fascism, something that Polanyi himself suffered from enormously,\u201d said Dale. \u201cThis is why it has renewed, real relevance today.\u201d\n\nThe Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi (Penguin Books Ltd, \u00a310.99).

        "body": "Labour will win by a mile but is coming to power at the worst possible moment. The economy has been laid waste by the Conservatives, who have deployed a scorched earth policy that will ensure the incoming government has the inheritance from hell.\n\nThat, at least, is the conventional wisdom, a view that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have done nothing to counter. There is a reason for that. It suits Labour\u2019s campaign message to paint the blackest possible picture so that it can blame the Tories for any tough decisions they have to make.\n\nEven so, the conventional wisdom is wrong. Without in any way minimising the challenges Starmer and Reeves face, this is actually not a bad time to be arriving in office.\n\nSure, excessively high interest rates threaten to derail the UK\u2019s fledgling recovery. No question, years of weak productivity growth, coupled with the cost of a pandemic, and a cost of living crisis have left the public finances in a mess. Nobody would dispute that the economy is in a worse state than it was the last time Labour emerged from opposition in 1997. Covid has left deep and permanent scars.\n\nThat said, the new government will have a number of things going for it. For a start, expectations are at such a rock-bottom level that it won\u2019t take much to exceed them. The desire of voters to get rid of the Tories does not appear to be matched by a similar enthusiasm for what Labour is offering. Faith in politicians of all stripes is at a low ebb, so nobody is anticipating much.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the Tories have been forced to clear up their own mess rather than \u2013 as was the case in 1964 and 1974 \u2013 leaving Labour to do the dirty work. And, to be fair, Sunak has made a reasonably good fist of it.\n\nIt is not really true that the Tories have been laying waste the economy. On the contrary, Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have taken some extremely unpopular decisions \u2013 the six-year freeze on tax allowances, for example \u2013 to reduce public borrowing.\n\nGiven the chaos they inherited from Liz Truss, they perhaps had little option but to play things straight, but Hunt\u2019s decision to provide firms with permanent 100% tax relief on investment spending was a smart move. It addresses one of the economy\u2019s enduring weaknesses and should bear fruit over time, helping Labour more than it has the Conservatives.\n\nAt the end of 2022, shortly after Truss left office, the Bank of England was expecting the longest recession in 100 years, one lasting from the summer of 2022 to the middle of this year.\n\nThe economy did end up in recession, but it was a short-lived and shallow affair lasting just two quarters and nothing like as severe as slumps of the past. All things considered, the economy held up a lot better to higher interest rates and rising taxes than the Bank feared.\n\nThe current state of the economy also suggests there is going to be a post-election bounce. Household budgets are much less stretched than they were a year ago because pay is rising faster than prices. That\u2019s insufficient to make good the losses suffered earlier in this parliament, but it does mean consumer confidence is on the up. There is evidence from the latest S&P snapshot of the economy that households have been putting off spending decisions until after the election.\n\nSooner or later, the Bank of England will decide the time is right to reduce interest rates. Theadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold at 5.25% this week but signalled that cheaper borrowing costs may not be that long in coming: either in August or September. The fact that some of the seven members who voted for no change said the decision was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d could mean the former.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the fact that the Bank is likely to move shortly after Labour arrives in power will reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This should cement the idea that a change of government has had a positive effect. Interest rates could be as low as 3% by the end of 2025.\n\nNor is Reeves as boxed in by fiscal policy as is assumed. She is committed to the same debt rule as Hunt \u2013 namely that debt as a share of national income should be falling at the end of a rolling five-year period. But as Andrew Goodwin, of the Oxford Economics consultancy, points out, the measure of debt used includes the impact of the cost of the Treasury indemnifying the Bank of England for losses when it sells UK bonds gilts bought under the money creation scheme known as quantitative easing.\n\nTweaking the debt rule to exclude these payments would give Reeves an extra \u00a320bn to play with, and it would be a major surprise \u2013 and a missed opportunity \u2013 were she not to announce the change in an autumn budget.\n\nThe way things are shaping up, that budget will take place with the Conservative party in turmoil following a defeat of historic proportions. Unless there is another Covid-like shock to the economy, Labour will be able to plan for two full terms in office. If tough decisions are needed \u2013 as they probably will be \u2013 Starmer and Reeves can say that is a price that sadly has to be paid after 14 years of Tory incompetence.",

        "body": "A human rights group has urged Britain\u2019s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein\u2019s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein\u2019s cotton suppliers in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.\n\nRepresented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that \u201cany attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused\u201d.\n\nThe China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (\u00a352bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein\u2019s potential London listing would be a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: \u201cShein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company\u2019s supply chains.\n\nThe group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK\u2019s convention obligations, it said.\n\n\u201cThe FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: \u201cStop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn\u2019t the place to come for a \u2018no questions asked\u2019 approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange\u2019s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein\u2019s supply chains.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign group\u2019s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the \u201caccuracy of its published modern slavery statement\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnder the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.\n\nBefore a company\u2019s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company\u2019s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA\u2019s role to independently verify the accurate of information.\n\nMichael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: \u201cA firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.\n\nThe company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.\n\nThe group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise \u00a330m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.\n\nThe decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.\n\nAt the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: \u201cThis unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London\u2019s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.\u201d\n\nThe change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.\n\nIn May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.\n\nHowever, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.\n\nThe Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.\n\nInstead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond novels.\n\nThe tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that it would then look to raise a further \u00a3120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.",

        "title": "Labour's North Sea oil and gas policy under attack from industry and activists",
        "body": "One of the policy areas on which the Labour Party has been very specific during this general election campaign is its approach towards North Sea oil and gas production.\n\nThe party has been clear that it will raise existing windfall taxes first slapped on North Sea oil and gas producers in 2022 by Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor, taking the total level of tax from the current 75% to 78%.\n\nMoney latest: Warning 400,000 homes face massive rise in mortgage costs\n\nEd Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, also proposes to take away tax reliefs Mr Sunak put in place alongside the windfall tax, to sugar the pill, which allowed producers to offset their investments in new production against their tax bills.\n\nMr Miliband, who has referred to these tax breaks as 'loopholes', argues this would bring the tax treatment of the British North Sea into line with that of the Norwegian North Sea. He is also proposing a ban on new oil and gas exploration licenses as part of what remains of his 'green prosperity plan'.\n\nWith Labour so far ahead in the polls, that is already having an effect on investment in the North Sea, with a trio of companies - Jersey Oil and Gas, Serica Energy and Neo Energy - announcing earlier this month that they are delaying, by a year, the planned start of production at the Buchan oilfield 120 miles to the north-east of Aberdeen.\n\nIndustry attacks\n\nSerica, which on average has produced 43,781 barrels of oil or oil equivalent per day so far this year, sought today to remind politicians of the potential consequences of their actions.\n\nDavid Latin, Serica's chairman and interim chief executive, unleashed a furious attack on the proposals - telling shareholders: \"I have been involved in this industry for more than 30 years and have worked all over the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Other than when I was responsible for a company which had significant assets in a war zone, I have never encountered a situation which was so challenging when it comes to making investment decisions, and planning for the future more generally, as it is in the UK at present.\"\n\nRead more\n\nFirst Universal theme park in Europe to generate '\u00a350bn of economic benefits for UK'\n\nNvidia share price plunge has one major explanation\n\nReminding his audience that the UK consumes almost twice as much oil and gas as it produces, Mr Latin said that deficit would persist even as the country sought to reduce its consumption of hydrocarbons, with the gap being filled by imports.\n\nHe added: \"These imports worsen our national balance of payments, only deliver jobs and taxes to foreign countries and, typically, have higher production and transportation carbon emissions by the time they get to our shores.\"\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nAddressing misconceptions\n\nCriticising the Conservatives for persisting with windfall taxes despite oil and gas prices having returned to historically normal levels and Labour for proposing to raise those taxes, Mr Latin said there were a number of misconceptions around the tax regime - not least the notion that the windfall tax is being paid largely by oil majors like Shell and BP.\n\nHe went on: \"As to the claim that the tax is being paid by the \"oil and gas giants\", it is in fact independent companies like Serica who are most affected. The 'majors' account for only around a third of UK production and the vast majority of their profits are made overseas and are not touched by increasing tax rates on UK production.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:03 Labour 'not turning off the taps' of oil and gas\n\n\"Indeed, for those companies such as Serica that continued to invest in their assets during periods of lower commodity prices prior to the invasion of Ukraine, the current fiscal regime represents a further punishment for risk capital committed to its portfolio during the very low commodity prices seen in the COVID period.\n\n\"Closing 'loopholes' in UK oil and gas tax seems to mean different things to different people.\n\n\"Whatever is meant, I wish to be crystal clear that reducing tax relief for capital expenditure below the rate at which tax is payable would make investment in the vast majority of UK North Sea projects unprofitable, meaning that these projects, and the jobs and tax revenues they would generate, simply will not happen.\"\n\nUnion criticism of Labour\n\nBut criticism of Labour's policy was also coming today from another direction.\n\nUnite, the UK's biggest union and traditionally Labour's biggest financial supporter, also has concerns banning new oil and gas exploration licences that could force the UK to import more gas when it still has plenty of its own.\n\nToday it published an open letter, urging a rethink on the ban, signed by nearly 200 local firms from Scottish towns dependent on the oil and gas industry - while some of those businesses joined Unite members in a demonstration outside Aberdeen's Maritime Museum.\n\nImage: Unite members protest outside the Aberdeen Maritime Museum. Pic: Unite\n\nSharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, said: \"Until Labour has a concrete plan for replacing North Sea jobs and ensuring energy security, the ban on new oil and gas exploration licenses should not go ahead.\n\n\"Labour must not allow oil and gas workers to become this generation's coal miners. Scotland's oil and gas communities are crying out for a secure future and that is what Labour must deliver.\"\n\nHowever, while businesses are warning that Labour's policy will drive investment elsewhere and unions worry about the impact on jobs and local communities in north-east Scotland, there are others who think the party could go further.\n\nImage: Offshore workers show support for Unite's no ban without a plancampaign. Pic: Unite.\n\nNot going far enough\n\nWhile Unite was staging its demonstration in Aberdeen, some 50 protestors from a group calling itself Stop Polluting Politics were staging one of their own 553 miles to the south at the Labour Party headquarters in Southwark, southeast London.\n\nThey allege that the party has \"financial ties to polluting corporations\" and have criticised a decision by Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, to accept a \u00a310,000 campaign donation from Lord Donoughue, the Labour peer, who has in the past chaired the Global Warming Policy Foundation - a climate change sceptic lobby group.\n\nThey allege that Ms Reeves's decision to 'water down' Mr Miliband's 'green prosperity plan' in February this year was influenced by the donation - something Lord Donoughue himself has vehemently denied.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIt all highlights how energy policy threatens to become a major headache for Labour should it win the election a week today.",
        "summary": "One of the policy areas on which the Labour Party has been very specific during this general election campaign is its approach towards North Sea oil and gas production.\nMr Miliband, who has referred to these tax breaks as 'loopholes', argues this would bring the tax treatment of the British North Sea into line with that of the Norwegian North Sea.\nHe is also proposing a ban on new oil and gas exploration licenses as part of what remains of his 'green prosperity plan'.\n\"Closing 'loopholes' in UK oil and gas tax seems to mean different things to different people.\nScotland's oil and gas communities are crying out for a secure future and that is what Labour must deliver.\"",

A mock-up of the storefront showed a gua sha facial massaging tool, arm weights and phone cases, among other items for sale.\n\nAmazon will ship the products directly from China to the U.S., with the goal of delivering them to shoppers within nine to 11 days, the presentation shows. In the past, Amazon sellers in China have relied on the company\u2019s fulfillment services, called Fulfillment by Amazon, to send goods to warehouses in the U.S. before they are dispatched to customers.\n\nThe company pitched the arrangement as cost savings for Amazon sellers in China, and said merchants would be able to test new items through small-batch production. Shein uses a similar model, referred to as on-demand manufacturing, producing a limited quantity of goods and manufacturing more as demand increases.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said, \u201cWe are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.\u201d\n\nBoschetti declined to comment further on the company\u2019s plans, which were first reported by The Information. It is unclear when Amazon intends to debut the storefront, but the presentation notes it will start accepting products this fall.\n\nChina-based merchants have made up a sizable contingent of Amazon\u2019s marketplace for many years, but the company is making a renewed push to court sellers there as it faces growing competition. In December, Amazon announced a new \u201cinnovation center\u201d in Shenzhen, a popular technology and manufacturing hub, and it also slashed the fees it charges merchants selling clothing priced below $20.\n\nAmazon said in 2023 the number of items sold by Chinese sellers on its site grew more than 20% year over year, while the number of Chinese merchants with sales upward of $10 million increased 30%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/amazon-plans-discount-store-in-bid-to-fend-off-temu-and-shein.html",

        "body": "Walgreens on Thursday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.\n\nThe retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company\u2019s previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\u2033\u2019We assumed.. in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\u201d but \u201cthat is not the case,\u201d Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn\u2019t actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we\u2019ve had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\u201d\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\u201c75% of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\u201d Wentworth said. \u201cWhat that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close\u2026\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Walgreens reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported a net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with a net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nExcluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.\n\nWalgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.\n\nStrong performance in health-care division\n\nWalgreens reported growth across its three business divisions in the fiscal third quarter. But the company\u2019s U.S. health-care unit stood out, as sales jumped 7.6% compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nRevenue for the segment came in at $2.13 billion. Analysts had expected sales of $2.08 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nThe company said the higher sales reflect primary care provider VillageMD and specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions. Shields saw sales jump 24% during the period, driven by growth within existing partnerships.\n\nSpecialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThose results come one quarter after Walgreens posted a steep net loss as it recorded a hefty nearly $6 billion charge related to the decline in value of its investment in VillageMD. The company now plans to shutter 160 VillageMD clinics, executives announced during the company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings call in March.\n\n\u201cWe are working with their management team to ultimately still be an investor, but meaningfully reduce our investment as well as gain some liquidity so that we can invest back in the retail pharmacy business that represents our future,\u201d Wentworth told CNBC of the company\u2019s investment in VillageMD.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $28.5 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 2.3% from the same period last year. Analysts had expected sales of $28.34 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nThat segment operates more than 8,000 drugstores across the U.S., which sell prescription and nonprescription drugs as well as health and wellness, beauty, personal care, and food products.\n\nThe company said that sales growth came entirely from comparable pharmacy sales and partially offset by a decline in retail revenue.\n\nWalgreens said pharmacy sales for the quarter rose 4.4% and comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7% compared to the year-earlier period due to price inflation in brand medications and prescription growth.\n\nTotal prescriptions filled in the quarter including vaccines totaled 306.4 million, a 0.5% increase from the same period a year ago.\n\nRetail sales for the quarter fell 4% from the prior-year quarter, and comparable retail sales declined 2.3%. The company pointed to a \u201cchallenging\u201d retail environment, among other factors.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 international segment, which operates more than 3,000 retail stores abroad, posted $5.73 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter. That\u2019s an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html",

        "body": "By Technical or fundamental analysis: which one is better for long-term investing? Myriad investors use one or the other technique on its own seemingly successfully, but using only one presents significant limitations.\n\nUsing a combination of both could be the ultimate winning strategy. Although the topic of technical analysis is controversial among a certain group of Wall Street investors, recent data points toward its importance when investing for the future.\n\nA study from March 2023 by Fidelity Investments\u2019 Vice President of Advanced Analytics and Insights Jasleen Kaur and a professor at the School of Business Studies in India Khushdeep Dharni looked at two different strategies of investing using advanced mathematics and computer software to mine the data necessary for more profitable trading.\n\nComputer algorithms examined both technical indicators and fundamental data across over 381 companies, showing that data-mining techniques incorporating elements of both technical and fundamental analysis led to better investment returns than a pure buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nSifting through a huge pile of data seems much easier with the rise of faster technology, but the core principles behind the platforms with automated tools have been around for a long time and could still be used by a qualified person to reach the same results.\n\nConducting fundamental analysis is crucial when evaluating stocks. One should have a comprehensive understanding of a company\u2019s financial health and performance. The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component \u2014 will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that\u2019ll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.\n\nThere\u2019s widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing. Although important, on its own it could prove to be limiting. For example, if one evaluates the stock and does not look at the current chart and volume movement, one could buy an overpriced stock right before the price is set to crash.\n\nThe second step, which is also of significance, involves conducting technical analysis. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time. If used in isolation, one could buy a stock of a company that is about to go under and lose all the investment. Meanwhile, the data shows that technical analysis is just as important.\n\nWhile the United States and India have very different markets, markets around the world are similar in terms of behavioral psychology and the research findings are true for investors around the globe in many ways.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s as hard to predict where the market will turn next as it is to predict the future. Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.\n\nIt\u2019s important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone\u2019s piece of advice. Diligent research is paramount \u2014 looking for and evaluating the newest research is crucial.",

        "body": "Introduction:\n\nFerrari (RACE) is a well-known auto manufacturer that produces vehicles that are the pinnacle of the automobile industry. Having a legendary status and a fiercely loyal fan base, Tifosi. RACE relentlessly protects its brand image. Limiting the number of vehicles sold per year, who it sells its cars to, and even controlling where its product ends up online. This fierce protection of brand image is because most of Ferrari\u2019s value comes from its strong brand goodwill that rivals the likes of Google, Disney, and even Coke. Ferrari is so adamant about protecting their brand image that it even opposes engaging in M&A, as it believes that doing so will dilute the Ferrari company's unique genetics. (SOURCE)\n\nMarket:\n\nSouth Korea\n\nTaking a look at each country\u2019s attitude towards luxury goods, South Korea is the most receptive towards luxury goods (SOURCE). On top of that, globally South Korea is also ranked 13 in terms of GDP (SOURCE). This means that South Korea is the target market for RACE given their willingness to purchase luxury and their ability to purchase luxury. However, the number of shipments to South Korea is so small that RACE does not report the individual country\u2019s % contribution.\n\nChina\n\n\u201cYoung market...the number of car that we shipped with this market is not so big.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. China is a big opportunity for RACE for several reasons 1) China is a rapidly growing economy thanks to massive government subsidies and cheaper labor, which means that there are more and more wealthy citizens. 2) China\u2019s culture cares about \u201cFace\u201d. Face is, in essence, social status. Having a luxury car in China is seen as a status symbol. RACE doesn't intend to rapidly expand in China as it is trying to control the supply of Ferraris in China to create the impression of scarcity and drum up value. However, I believe that the growing class of wealthy individuals in China represents a large opportunity for RACE.\n\nLuxury Goods\n\nThere is a growing distinction between \u201cNew Money\u201d and \u201cOld Money\u201d. Old Money means generational wealth where they prefer less flashy but significantly higher-quality products, \u201cStealth Wealth\u201d. Whereas New Money means a growing group of people who transitioned above the middle class, they see the need to buy flashy products with strong logos to flaunt their wealth. There is also a growing desire amongst younger people to purchase luxury goods due to social media constantly promoting these goods, creating the impression that to own a luxury product is to be part of an exclusive group, playing into the large FOMO factor of this demographic. As an example, 62% of GUCCI\u2019s customers are under 35 (SOURCE) This distinction means that the demographic of customers purchasing luxurious goods is not the ultra-wealthy but the rising upper middle class. So, I believe that RACE's main demographic is the younger New Money crowd.\n\nRevenue:\n\nCars and Spare Parts\n\n\u201cCars and Spare Parts\u201d include selling Ferrari cars, their spare parts, and personalization. Taking a look at data from (SOURCE)\n\nWhen forecasting the number of shipments, from FY11 to FY23 the number of Ferrari shipped grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 6.00%. I assumed that this growth rate would tick slightly upwards as RACE pushes out its electric vehicle line-up and its new Purosangue line-up. However, in perpetuity, I assumed that RACE would taper the growth rate of their shipments down towards historical averages to keep the total number of Ferraris on the road low to maintain the brand\u2019s image.\n\nWhen forecasting the Revenue/Shipment, I believe that in the earlier years of my forecast due to RACE pushing out their newer EVs, they would not increase prices to a large extent. However, over time due to the growth in the number of wealthy people (SOURCE), RACE would increase the sale price of their cars to control the number of Ferrari on the road and maintain the luxurious image of a Ferrari. I also believe that over time as Personalization becomes more prevalent in the Ferrari experience (SOURCE), RACE can charge a higher amount. I believe that in perpetuity, Revenue/Shipment grows at a slightly higher rate than the perpetual inflation rate. As Ferraris are luxury goods, they command a higher premium and are likely to attract consumers who are price-inelastic.\n\nSponsorship, Commercial and Brand\n\n\u201cSponsorship, Commercial and Brand\u201d includes brand sponsorship Ferrari earns from F1 and other racing events and any merchandise sold.\n\nThe main value driver behind Ferrari isn\u2019t the fact that they\u2019ve managed to raise their revenue but rather it\u2019s because the Ferrari branding has become more and more valuable over time due to their prominence in motorsports. As a proxy, I took a look at professional soccer teams, soccer teams have massively low margins attributable to a few factors such as 1) Uncertainty in performance and 2) inflating player salaries. A sports team can\u2019t control how it will perform as every sport is very dynamic with multiple unpredictable factors at play, consistently poor performance will lead to the team losing fans, and in turn, since there are less monetizable eyeballs the team will end up losing sponsorship deals. The valuation of these sports teams is largely based on precedent transactions as there are no stable cash flows that these teams can generate. In the case of F1 where there are only 10 teams, there is not much competition for talent which negates the issue of inflating player salaries. RACE has also been consistently placing in the top spots in F1. So, Ferrari hopes it can leverage this branding to appeal to sponsors.\n\nWhen forecasting the number of sponsors, I took a look at the number of sponsors to Ferrari\u2019s F1 team, Scuderia Ferrari. This is so as Ferrari places heavy emphasis on their F1 team specifically mentioning their importance to Ferrari\u2019s strong brand recognition. And, \u201cFormula 1 is a channel through which Ferrari's potential target audience can be reached directly\u201d (SOURCE). I believe to not overly dilute the value of being a team sponsor, RACE caps the number of sponsors at 40.\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Sponsor, sponsorship is mainly for advertising purposes which is a cyclical expenditure that explains the recent decline in the growth rate of revenue/sponsor. I assumed that in the first 2 years of my forecast, given the uncertainty in macro conditions advertising spending would remain depressed. However, ultimately, as the Ferrari brand increases in value so will the sponsorship amount. In perpetuity, I assumed that revenue/sponsor would grow at a slightly higher rate than the perpetual inflation rate.\n\nEngines\n\n\u201cEngines\u201d includes any engine sold to Maserati and other F1 teams. However \u201cMaserati whose contract expired at the end of 2023. Therefore, from the first quarter 2024 onward, any residual contribution from the sales of engine and spare parts, whether for sport cars or racing, will be reported in the bar, named others.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, I lumped Engines and Others together.\n\nCost:\n\nCOGS\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, RACE incurs higher costs in their earlier years of producing the new line-up of EVs. I assumed that over time as RACE\u2019s supply chain matures they can maintain their historic margins. According to (SOURCE), RACE\u2019s pre-covid margins hovered around 52%.\n\nSG&A and Others\n\nWhen forecasting the Number of Employees, Cost/Employee, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages.\n\nR&D\n\nGiven management\u2019s push towards producing higher quality EVs, it has led to a lot of front-loaded R&D expenditure in FY21, which management ended up cutting back in FY22 and FY23. So, when forecasting R&D I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast R&D expenditure would remain at recent historical levels before tapering back to 18.5% at pre-covid levels\n\nTaxes:\n\nGiven that RACE is incorporated in The Netherlands, the marginal tax rate is 25.80% (SOURCE. So, in perpetuity, I assumed that RACE would pay taxes at 25.80%.\n\nWACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.37%\n\nStable Market ERP (SOURCE) = 4.60%\n\nBeta (SOURCE) = 1.01\n\nCOE = 9.02%\n\nRACE has no bond rating. So, I decided to apply a synthetic rating from (SOURCE)\n\nFY23 EBIT = 1617.37M\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 29.26M\n\nFY23 Interest Coverage Ratio = 55.3x\n\nBy Synthetic Rating, RACE would be rated \u201cAAA\u201d, given that The Netherlands is also rated \u201cAAA\u201d. RACE is appropriate to be rated AAA.\n\nAAA Bond Yield = 4.37%\n\nMarginal Tax Rate = 25.80%\n\nAT COD = 3.24%\n\nStock Price (5D Avg) = $390.20\n\nShares O/S = 243.75M\n\nMarket Value of Equity = 95111.25M\n\nWeighted Average Maturity of Debt = 3 Years.\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 29.26M\n\nMarket Value of Debt = 2005.61M\n\n%Debt =2.07%\n\n%Equity = 97.93%\n\n%WACC = 8.90%\n\nConclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value RACE at $267.31 per share. I believe that RACE is heavily overvalued as investors highly value the goodwill built by RACE. The function for shipment revenue is the quantity shipped and price per shipment. RACE faces a dilemma where if they increase their quantity shipped it would increase revenue but at the same time dilute the value of the Ferrari brand. There is a possibility that management could increase the other variable instead, but I am skeptical at what pace is management able to raise it comfortably. I believe that the road forward for RACE is to lean more heavily into its merchandise to remain in the public consciousness and to continue building brand goodwill.\n\nBase Case: [INSERT]\n\nBest Case: [INSERT]\n\nWorst Case: [INSERT]\n\nSanity Check: [INSERT]\n\nRevenue Model: [INSERT]\n\nCost Model: [INSERT]\n\nChange in NWC Schedule: [INSERT]\n\nDebt Schedule: [INSERT]",

Also, hyperlinks to Finviz added, hopefully I'll be able to implement this going forward in the future! :)\n\nMU- Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn\u2019t as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)\n\nWBA- Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs.

If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones.

I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: US Recurring Jobless Claims Rise to Highest Since End of 2021\n\nMostly earnings aftermaths today.\n\nMU- Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn\u2019t as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)\n\nWBA- Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs. CVS down in sympathy.\n\nLEVI- Reported revenue of 1.44B vs 1.45 expected, and EPS of $0.16 vs $0.04. Beat expectations, but CFO warned that consumers have been \u201cgenerally cautious\u201d about spending.\n\nAMZN- Hitting all time highs, watching 195/200 levels. No \u201cnew news\u201d beyond that, so mainly will be patient for this one.\n\nRIVN- No new news beyond the Volkswagen investment, but still watching this.\n\nEarnings today: NKE\n\nIPO today: WBTN (Webtoon, extremely interested in this)",

        "body": "In March 2018, a day after announcing sweeping tariffs on metals imported from America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike, President Donald J. Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: \u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nAs president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.\n\nNow, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed \u201cuniversal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,\u201d including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.\n\nMr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.",

        "title": "A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business",
        "body": "Talking points\n\nAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.\n\nThere will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here\u2019s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate \u201cbingo card\u201d further below.)\n\nThe economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?\n\nInflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they\u2019re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 \u2014 an economy many Americans want back.\n\nTaxes: Biden\u2019s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: \u201cIt\u2019s simple math,\u201d David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don\u2019t like Biden\u2019s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.\n\nProtectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.\n\nMarkets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night\u2019s debate, \u201cmarkets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping \u201csome continuity.\u201d\n\nOther issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue \u2014 and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:\n\nFor Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.\n\nFor Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.",

        "title": "Help! Qatar Airways Denied Us Boarding Because of a Broken Link.",
        "body": "Dear Tripped Up,\n\nI am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a \u201cHealth Declaration Form\u201d in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn\u2019t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets \u2014 we received $1,185 \u2014 but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nYour run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding \u201cthousands of times a day,\u201d said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.\n\nNot to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.\n\nCountries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week\u2019s vacation. But travel can be complicated \u2014 consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways\u2019 hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.",

Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.\n\nSince 2012, the Affordable Care Act has mandated that private insurance plans cover the \u201cfull range\u201d of contraceptives for women approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including female sterilizations, emergency contraceptives and any new products cleared by the F.D.A. The mandate also covers services associated with contraceptives, like counseling, insertions or removals and follow-up care.\n\nThat means that consumers shouldn\u2019t have any associated co-payments with in-network providers, even if they haven\u2019t met their deductibles. Some plans might cover only generic versions of certain contraceptives, but patients are still entitled to coverage of a specific product that their providers deem medically necessary.

The underlying cause, though, are the billions of dollars their government owes its creditors.\n\nKenya has the fastest growing economy in Africa and a vibrant business center. But its government is desperate to stave off default. The country\u2019s staggering $80 billion in domestic and foreign public debt accounts for nearly three-quarters of Kenya\u2019s entire economic output, according to a recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Interest payments alone are eating up 27 percent of the revenue collected.\n\nThe Kenyan president, William Ruto, had promoted the tax bill as necessary to avoid defaulting on the country\u2019s debt, but the violent reaction to Parliament\u2019s approval prompted Mr. Ruto to abruptly reverse course on Wednesday and reject the legislation he had asked for. \u201cListening keenly to the people of Kenya,\u201d he said, \u201cI will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subsequently be withdrawn.\u201d He proposed a 14-day period of discussions to chart a new economic course.\n\nMr. Ruto\u2019s turnaround may have temporarily quieted protests, but it leaves the country\u2019s finances more precarious than before. Just two weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund and Kenyan authorities had reached an agreement on a package of comprehensive reforms and tax increases needed to get the country on a more stable financial footing.",

An arched bridge over it, which I crossed on my walk to high school, marked the transition from home to the stresses of my teenage years. I learned, too, that reaches of the river acclaimed by Melville, Ives and Longfellow were laden with PCBs, an industrial pollutant.\n\nTourists, taking their cue from locals, have only rarely ventured down to the Housatonic\u2019s banks. But in recent years, the river\u2019s cleanup (the next stages of which remain a source of fierce community debate) has reminded everyone who loves the Berkshires that the Housatonic needs our attention and \u2014 whether from a canoe or a riverside trail \u2014 abundantly rewards our affection.",

The league has stuck to this approach even as Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other leagues moved more of their games onto cable and satellite broadcasters and subscription streaming services.\n\nThe strategy has paid off: Ninety-three of the 100 most-watched programs on television last year were N.F.L. games, according to Nielsen.\n\nYet N.F.L. games are not cheap and ubiquitous enough for all fans. This month, the league has been in federal court in Los Angeles fending off a class-action suit brought by millions of customers who paid for Sunday Ticket, the subscription service on DirecTV that showed all out-of-market games on Sundays.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that the N.F.L. colluded with CBS and Fox to artificially inflate the price of the service, which cost roughly $300 a season, because the networks viewed Sunday Ticket as competition. The plaintiffs argue that the N.F.L. dismissed offers to create cheaper services that would have let fans buy games based on teams. They are seeking damages of $7 billion, which could be tripled under antitrust statutes. That could take a significant bite out the league\u2019s annual media rights, which are now worth more than $10 billion a year.",

        "title": "Here's the Net Worth of Married Couples by Age: How Do You Stack Up?",
        "body": "SmartAsset: Average Retirement Savings for Married Couples by Age\n\nA recent study from the career experts Zety says that 40% of respondents fear retirement more than death. And almost nine in 10 responded that their biggest retirement fear is not having enough income. For married couples, planning retirement for two people can be complicated. How much they will need will depend on their financial circumstances. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the average retirement savings for couples by age.\n\nA financial expert could help you create a financial plan for your retirement needs and goals.\n\nWhat Are Average Retirement Savings By Age?\n\nUnfortunately, many Americans aren\u2019t putting enough money away for their future. In fact, 25% of Americans have no retirement savings at all according to a report from PWC. And among those who haven\u2019t saved enough for retirement, EBRI research estimates that households as of January 2020 saved $3.68 trillion less than what they should have in their retirement accounts.\n\nAnother study by Vanguard calculated the average 401(k) balances by age. The table below breaks down average and median balances by age group:\n\n<25 Average 401(k) balance: $6,718. Median 401(k) balance:$2,240\n\n25-34 Average 401(k) balance: $33,272. Median 401(k) balance: $13,265\n\n35-44 Average 401(k) balance: $86,582. Median 401(k) balance: $32,664\n\n45-54 Average 401(k) balance: $161,079. Median 401(k) balance: $56,722\n\n55-64 Average 401(k) balance: $232,379. Median 401(k) balance: $84,714\n\n65+ Average 401(k) balance: $255,151. Median 401(k) balance: $82,297\n\nOn average, someone under age 25 is saving less than $7,000, while someone between ages 55 and 64 averages just over $232,000. This data breaks down individual balances by age group, but for married couples, targets will differ depending on the couple\u2019s age, household income and whether there is a sole earner or dual income.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nRetirement Savings Benchmarks for Married Couples\n\nSmartAsset: Average Retirement Savings for Married Couples by Age\n\nFinancial experts say that a couple aged 60 with a dual income of $75,000 per year should have seven times their household income in their retirement account. This multiplies to a total of $525,000 saved. Conversely, a couple aged 65 with a sole earner bringing in $75,000 per year should have saved seven and a half times their household income, which adds up to $562,500 in their retirement account.\n\nThe table below breaks down savings targets based on data assumptions made by the investment management firm T.Rowe Price. In parenthesis you will see how many times over your current household income you should have:\n\nStory continues\n\nHousehold Income Married, Dual Income at Age 55 Married, Dual Income at Age 65 Married, Single Income at Age 55 Married, Single Income at Age 65 $75,000 $412,500 (5.5x) $675,000 (9x) $337,500 (4.5x) $562,500 (7.5x) $100,000 $600,000 (6x) $1 Million (10x) $500,000 (5x) $850,000 (8.5x) $150,000 $975,000 (6.5x) $1.575 Million (10.5x) $900,000 (6x) $1.500 Million (10x) $200,000 $1.300 Million (6.5x) $2.200 Million(11x) $1.400 million (7x) $2.300 Million (11.5x) $250,000 $1.700 Million (7x) $2.875 Million (11.5x) $1.875 Million (7.5x) $3.125 Million (12.5x) Why You Should Not Rely on Social Security Alone\n\nAs of January 2022, retired couples who receive Social Security benefits collect an average of $2,753 per month. This amount equates to what you could get with a minimum wage job. So, for many American couples, this might not be sufficient to maintain their lifestyle once they enter into their golden years.\n\nOn top of that, many older Americans are carrying more debt, which will eat into their Social Security income. So when you\u2019re creating a retirement plan as a couple, financial experts will advise to assess your financial situation and make adjustments accordingly.\n\nRegardless of your income level, mapping out your financial situation is a smart way to prepare for retirement. This big-picture perspective will help you be more intentional with how much money you are putting into your retirement savings and avoid a possible income gap later in life if your needs outpace your savings.\n\nConsider consulting a financial advisor to find an appropriate strategy for growing your net worth.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSmartAsset: Average Retirement Savings for Married Couples by Age\n\nWhen looking at the average retirement savings for married couples by age, the data is sobering. Even if you save more than the recommended amounts and plan to apply for Social Security benefits, you may still not have enough to live the life you desire in retirement. Financial professionals often treat retirement savings as a destination with several checkpoints along the road. While some experts recommend you save at least one year\u2019s worth of your household income by the time you reach age 30, it doesn\u2019t hurt to save even more.\n\nWhen you are ready to retire, it\u2019s a good benchmark to strive for at least 9x to 11x your household income in savings. But because your needs will vary as a married couple, you will need to assess your financial situation and make adjustments accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to save between at least 10% and 15% of your household income each year.\n\nTips to Help You Save for Retirement\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, 60% of those with self-directed retirement accounts are not confident about their investment decisions. If you\u2019re one of them, why not hire a financial advisor? SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nCounting on Social Security benefits alone likely won\u2019t provide full support for your current lifestyle. But, benefits can definitely help with your living expenses in retirement. SmartAsset\u2019s Social Security calculator will help you estimate how much of a benefit you can expect.\n\nAnd, if you want to figure out whether you are saving enough for retirement, SmartAsset\u2019s free retirement calculator can help you determine how much you will need.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Geber86, \u00a9iStock.com/SrdjanPav, \u00a9iStock.com/Doucefleur\n\nThe post Average Retirement Savings for Married Couples By Age appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.",

        "title": "Warren Buffett donates again to the Gates Foundation but will cut the charity off after his death",
        "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Investor Warren Buffett announced another $5.3 billion in charitable gifts Friday, but in a major shift of his longtime giving plan he said he plans to cut off donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after his death and let his three children decide how to distribute the rest of his $128 billion fortune.\n\nBuffett laid out his new plan for his estate in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. The 93-year-old billionaire who leads Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press on Friday about his plan that calls for Howard, Susie and Peter Buffett to unanimously agree where to give his Berkshire Hathaway stock after his death.\n\nBuffett has given about $55 billion worth of Berkshire stock to five foundations since he outlined his giving plan in 2006, with the biggest share by far going to the Gates Foundation. The other four foundations are affiliated with his family, including the ones each of his children run.\n\n\u201cThe Gates Foundation has no money coming after my death,\u201d said Buffett, who left the Gates Foundation's board in 2021 after Bill Gates, one of his best friends, announced he and Melinda French Gates were divorcing. French Gates left the Gates Foundation earlier this year.\n\nIn his initial pledge to the Gates Foundation in 2006, Buffett wrote that he planned to include the foundation in his will. \u201cI will soon write a new will that will provide for a continuance of this commitment \u2014 by distribution of the remaining earmarked shares or in some other manner \u2014 after my death,\u201d he wrote then, referring to the annual gifts of Berkshire Hathaway stock that he was pledging.\n\nBut Buffett said in a statement Friday that his original pledges are only good until his death.\n\nBuffett will leave it up to his kids to decide what to do with his Berkshire stock, much like he does now when he lets the foundations decide how to use his gifts. He said they already know the goal of his giving.\n\n\u201cIt should be used to help the people that haven\u2019t been as lucky as we have been,\u201d Buffett told the Journal. \u201cThere\u2019s eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we\u2019ve been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There\u2019s lots of ways to help people.\u201d\n\nMark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, said in a statement that he appreciates Buffett's generosity over the years.\n\n\u201cWarren Buffett has been exceedingly generous to the Gates Foundation through more than 18 years of contributions and advice,\" Suzman said. \"He has played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation\u2019s work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life. We are deeply grateful for his most recent gift and contributions totaling approximately $43 billion to our work.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe value of Buffett\u2019s donations have grown with the steady rise in price of Berkshire\u2019s stock, so the stock he has given away to date is already worth more than his entire fortune of $43 billion when he announced his plan. The conglomerate\u2019s most widely traded Class B shares are up about 22% in the just past 12 months.\n\n\u201cNothing extraordinary has occurred at Berkshire; a very long runway, simple but generally sound capital deployment, the American tailwind and compounding effects produced my current wealth,\u201d Buffett said in a statement. \u201cMy will provides that more than 99% of my estate is destined for philanthropic usage.\u201d\n\nBuffett's own Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation has been a major supporter of abortion rights over the years, but he has let his children and the Gates Foundation make their own decisions about how to distribute his gifts. Howard Buffett has given more than $500 million to help Ukraine since Russia invaded as part of his focus on helping war-torn regions.\n\nBuffett also occasionally makes other gifts to unnamed charities but he hasn't ever disclosed the details of those gifts.\n\nBuffett will still own 207,963 Class A Berkshire shares and 2,586 Class B shares after giving away a little over 13 million Class B shares Friday. Because of the voting power of the Class A shares, Buffett continues to have the biggest say by far in the operations of the massive conglomerate based in Omaha, Nebraska that he leads as chairman and CEO. He hasn't bought or sold any Berkshire shares in the past 18 years.\n\nBuffett has said that one of his vice chairman, Greg Abel, who already oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, will take over as CEO after he is gone. Berkshire owns an eclectic assortment of manufacturing, retail and service businesses including BNSF railroad, several large utilities, Dairy Queen and Precision Castparts. Insurance companies, including Geico and General Reinsurance, are also a core part of Berkshire, and the company owns a huge stock portfolio dominated by iconic companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express and Bank of America.\n\nBuffett's son Howard, who already serves on Berkshire's board, is slated to become chairman after his father's death, but Buffett's children won't play an active role in the day-to-day operations of the company.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report from New York.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- To interest-rate strategists at Barclays Plc watching the presidential debate Thursday night, the trade was clear: buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWith former president Donald Trump appearing more likely to unseat Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election, the market should \u201cbe pricing in a considerable risk of higher-than-target inflation in the coming years, and this is from a starting point of our thinking they already offered structural value,\u201d Barclays strategists Michael Pond and Jonathan Hill said in a note.\n\nThe simple trade, they wrote, is a wager that five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, will outperform regular five-year Treasuries, leading to a wider yield spread between the two. That breakeven rate \u2014 representing the market-implied expectation for the average inflation rate of the consumer price index over the life of the securities \u2014 will widen to 2.5% from about 2.25% currently, Barclays projects.\n\nTrump has proposed steep tariffs on imports, particularly on goods from China, and an aggressive effort to deport those working in the US illegally. He has also pledged to extend across-the-board tax cuts, which would likely worsen the federal deficit and add stimulus to an economy that the Federal Reserve is seeking to restrain.\n\nAt 2.25%, the five-year breakeven rate suggests that the market\u2019s expectation for CPI are in line with the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the strategists said. The Fed targets a different inflation gauge \u2014 the price index for personal consumption expenditures \u2014 which averages 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than the CPI.\n\nInflation continues to exceed the Fed\u2019s target rate, but by shrinking margins. Data released Friday showed the PCE price index increased 2.6% in May from a year earlier, down from 2.7% in April. The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, also rose 2.6%, the slowest increase since March 2021.\n\nBut if the odds in the coming months continue to favor a second Trump term, \u201cwe would expect them to be embedded in the market via higher breakevens as the November elections approach,\u201d Pond and Hill wrote.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "One of the biggest themes in the markets for the last two years has been artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNaturally, famed entrepreneur Elon Musk has found himself at the center of the AI revolution -- and he just gave investors a big reason to seriously consider both Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nLet's explore how Musk is working with these AI leaders, and assess if these stocks are good buys right now.\n\nWhat did Elon Musk just say?\n\nIn addition to running Tesla and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is also managing an AI start-up, called xAI.\n\nxAI is building a chatbot called Grok, and is aiming to compete with the likes of OpenAI. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI but abandoned the project back in 2018. Since his departure, Musk has gotten into many publicized tiffs with OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, over safety concerns and how AI should be used in society.\n\nIn early June, Musk revealed that xAI will be utilizing a series of AI chips from Nvidia. The entrepreneur followed up this announcement with another exciting development.\n\nSMC -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2024\n\nNamely, Musk took to X to tell investors and AI enthusiasts that xAI will be partnering with Dell and Supermicro to build its AI infrastructure such as server rack solutions and factory architecture.\n\nHow Dell and Supermicro stand to benefit\n\nAI has many different components. One of the biggest bellwethers for AI at the moment are specialized chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are used to train large language models and other computing functions to develop generative AI applications.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is the undisputed leader of AI chips -- owning an estimated 80% share of the market.\n\nHowever, deploying chips into machine learning models and other use cases is only part of the broader equation. Companies such as Dell and Supermicro specialize in a different area within the chip realm.\n\nBoth Dell and Supermicro are major players in AI infrastructure solutions. Essentially, both companies specialize in designing integrated systems architecture, server racks, and storage clusters for data centers.\n\nConsidering xAI just raised $6 billion in funding back in May, Dell and Supermicro appear well positioned to benefit from AI tailwinds as xAI moves swiftly to catch up with the competition.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDell, Supermicro, both, or neither?\n\nOn the surface, owning different businesses across the semiconductor landscape might be a good idea. AI is still in its infancy, and there are many different applications among chip companies that are playing a role in the technology's development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, a close look at valuation should shed some light on investing in Dell and Supermicro in particular.\n\nDELL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Dell and Supermicro over the last few years. While neither stock looks cheap, Dell is clearly trading at a noticeable discount to Supermicro. With that said, Supermicro's premium is arguably warranted considering how fast the company is growing.\n\nMoreover, one of my biggest knocks against Supermicro has been that the company relies heavily on business from Nvidia -- a dynamic that could hurt the company in the long run as more companies design competing chips.\n\nNow, with a nod of approval from Musk and xAI, I'm more optimistic about Supermicro's prospects of branching out and earning meaningful business from new customers in the AI space.\n\nAt the end of the day, allocating a portion of your AI holdings to both Dell and Supermicro could be a good idea for long-term investors. If I had to just choose one company, I think Dell is the better value compared to Supermicro based on its lower P/E and diversified business. Considering Supermicro is still relatively small, I think its valuation needs to continue normalizing before it looks like a bargain opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has been one tasty quesadilla of a stock on the exchange over the years. The fast-casual restaurant chain operator didn't have a good session on the market Thursday, however. Its shares fell more than 5% in value, which wasn't unusual given what happened the previous day.\n\nStock-split indigestion\n\nChipotle investors started Wednesday with a much higher number of shares than they held previously. Of course, this was due to the 50-for-1 stock split that kicked in that morning.\n\nThat ratio is pretty high -- most stock splits are more in the 10-for-1 range or so -- but it feels like a good move given how pricey the restaurant operator became on a per-share basis. A cheaper stock is a more attractive one, and it's likely many investors piled into Chipotle recently in the hopes that its popularity would surge post-split.\n\nOften with price-pushing events, when the event itself is over, many folks book the profits they made on the run-up. This quick, heavy selling tends to push a stock's price down. In the absence of any negative fundamental news for Chipotle, profit-taking is likely the main culprit for the Wednesday swoon.\n\nMore of the same\n\nIt's important to note here that, as with any stock split, the value of Chipotle stock did not change at all. Investors still held the same amount of stock in dollar terms as they had previously; the only changes were the number of shares and the price.\n\nGiven all that, no one should bail on Chipotle simply because it's on the other side of a big financial engineering effort. Believers in the company's business model might even pounce on the price weakness.

Biden's age of 81 has been a hot-button topic among voters concerned over whether or not he can continue to run the country.\n\n\"Biden's bumbling and stumbling performance amplified concerns regarding his capacity to serve and set off a new round of panic in the Democratic Party,\" Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research, said in reaction to Thursday's debate. \"Trump won the debate and should be viewed as the clear frontrunner this morning, but his demeanor and falsehoods appeared to underscore the concerns some voters have with his fitness for office.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden faced off in a debate Thursday evening. (AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nShares of DJT have been on a bumpy ride in recent months, oscillating between highs and lows.\n\nIn May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 a verdict that sent shares down 5% the day following the conviction.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n\nShares have fallen about 44% since the company's public debut at the end of March.\n\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms, although the former president almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social account throughout the trial.\n\nIn April, an updated regulatory filing showed Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.\n\nIn May, the company reported first quarter results that revealed losses of $327 million, mostly tied to expenses related to its SPAC deal. The company disclosed as of April 29 over 621,000 different shareholders owned stock in Trump Media, noting the \"vast majority\" of these were retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% stake in DJT. At current levels of around $32 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $4.3 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $2.6 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\n\nIn late April, the stock hit a milestone that secured Trump an additional $1.2 billion in cash.

        "title": "JPMorgan\u2019s Kolanovic Warns S&P 500 Will Plummet 23% by Year-End",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index may be headed for another record closing high, but JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Marko Kolanovic says the benchmark will falter in coming months in the face of mounting headwinds, from a slowing economy to downward earnings revisions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe US equity guage is poised to plunge to 4,200 by year-end, a roughly 23% drop from Thursday\u2019s close around 5,483, the bank\u2019s chief market strategist and his team said Friday in a mid-year outlook. It surpassed the 5,500 mark in early trading Friday after a key measure of US inflation showed signs of cooling.\n\nKolanovic\u2019s view reiterates the call he\u2019s stuck to all year, even as other Wall Street forecasters upgraded their predictions to keep up with the surge in stocks. JPMorgan\u2019s target is the lowest among strategists tracked by Bloomberg. The average year-end projection, of 5,317, implies a roughly 3% drop.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear disconnect in the huge run-up in US equity valuations and the business cycle,\u201d the strategists wrote, adding that the S&P 500\u2019s 15% year-to-date gain isn\u2019t justified, given waning growth projections. \u201cThere is a risk that an opposite of the hopeful expectation could play out in coming quarters where growth decelerates, inflation remains firm, and long-term rates don\u2019t move sharply lower.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s strategists stand out among Wall Street\u2019s megabanks in flagging the risk of a big US stock selloff. Peers at firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have steadily ratcheted up their S&P 500 targets this year. And Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson, who last year stood alongside Kolanovic in his bearish calls, has stopped issuing such warnings.\n\nKolanovic has been wrong before, staying bullish in 2022 as the S&P 500 tumbled 19% and sticking with a bearish view in 2023 as the benchmark soared 24%. He views the optimism around stocks with skepticism now as he says key economic indicators are stalling and consumers are showing signs of distress.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Federal Reserve may deliver fewer interest-rate cuts than the market expects, further pressuring the economy and stock valuations in the second half of the year, Kolanovic said.\n\nThe S&P 500 has already notched 31 closing records this year through Thursday. A key to that has been excitement around artificial intelligence, which has spurred outsized gains for the market\u2019s largest stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nKolanovic recommends that investors diversify by boosting exposure to \u201canti-momentum\u201d defensive value plays like utilities, consumer staples, health care and dividend stocks.\n\n\u2018Underappreciated\u2019 Resiliency\n\nHe acknowledged that he \u201cunderappreciated the resiliency\u201d of megacap tech companies in terms of price momentum and earnings growth. But he warned that the degree of crowding into those stocks and the concentration of market leadership are at \u201cmulti-decade extremes.\u201d\n\nWithout the sway of the 20 largest stocks in the index, the S&P 500 would be around the 4,700 level, JPMorgan estimates. The strategists say earnings forecasts would need to be revised higher for the group\u2019s strength to continue, something they view as a \u201cchallenge.\u201d They expect Wall Street analysts will revise their estimates down after second-quarter results.\n\n\u201cWhile timing reversals and rotations is difficult, we are in the camp that hyperbolic moves in price and sentiment are more often violently corrected than not when the exuberance runs its course, and the largest institutional investors are done chasing,\u201d Kolanovic said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Its board also authorized $30 billion in new share buybacks, effective July 1.\n\nBank of America's dividend will rise to 26 cents a share from 24 cents, and Citigroup's will increase to 56 cents from 53 cents, the lenders said in separate regulatory filings.\n\n\"Banks are going to remain conservative on capital as uncertainty over the Basel proposal remains,\" Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said after the dividends were announced.\n\nBanks have argued that higher capital requirements proposed under draft rules known as the Basel endgame could impede their ability to lend and could be detrimental for the economy.\n\nMorgan Stanley boosted its dividend to 92.5 cents a share from 85 cents, according to a filing.\n\nThe announcements came after the banks cleared the Fed's stress test earlier this week, which determines how much capital they need to set aside before they can return money to shareholders.\n\nGoldman Sachs' dividend will climb to $3 per share, compared with $2.75 earlier.\n\nHow well a bank performs on the stress tests dictates the size of its stress capital buffer (SCB) - an extra cushion of capital the Fed requires banks to hold to weather a hypothetical economic downturn.\n\nGoldman said it will engage with its regulator to better understand why its SCB jumped.\n\n\"This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we\u2019ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity,\" CEO David Solomon said in a statement.\n\nWells Fargo's dividend will rise to 40 cents.\n\nThis year, 31 big banks were tested, compared with 23 last year.

        "body": "Nike (NKE) stock fell nearly 20% on Friday after the retailer said it expects revenue to decline more than it previously thought in the coming year.\n\nThe company said Thursday it expects revenue to fall mid-single digits in 2025, including an expected 10% decline in the first quarter. Nike had initially guided for overall sales growth in 2025.\n\nFriday marked the worst single-day decline in Nike stock's history.\n\nThe guidance reflects a continuing trend from Nike's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which the shoemaker reported after the closing bell on Thursday. The company said quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61 billion, below Wall Street's estimates for $12.86 billion. Meanwhile, Nike's $0.99 earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations of $0.66. Nike's direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $5.1 billion.\n\n\"Fiscal [2025] will be a transition year for our business,\" Nike CEO John Donahoe said during the company's earnings call.\n\nThe company has been trying to reignite sales growth in what has been a lackluster year for the stock so far. Morningstar equity analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance the sales number was \"pretty weak\" and was the main concern from the release.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton downgraded Nike to Equalweight from Overweight following the earnings call, noting Nike stock has been \"put in the penalty box\" for the near-term. Straton cut her price target to $79 from $114.\n\n\"While undergoing strategic change, recent performance has been riddled with quarterly\n\nmisses & guidance cuts,\" Straton wrote in a note to clients. \"NKE\u2019s long-term growth & profitability trajectory is subsequently both unclear & lower than our prior assumption.\"\n\nThe company's stock had already entered the release down more than 17% over the last year, a far cry from the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 26% gain, as investors grew wary of slowing growth at the retailer.\n\n\"We doubt many investors will view this as a 'buy the pullback' event, and we think NKE shares are headed for a stay in the proverbial penalty box until new product innovations actually start to manifest themselves and management regains investor trust,\" Wedbush senior vice president of equity research Tom Nikic wrote in a note following the earnings call.\n\nWall Street has been closely watching Nike's product pipeline as the Oregon-based company works to fend off competition in its core athletic footwear market from rivals like Adidas (ADDYY) and relative upstarts like On (ONON) and Deckers' (DECK) Hoka brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nNike executives stressed they believe their plans to scale new products are on \"track\" and will impact the company's financials by the end of the year.\n\n\"We are planning for meaningful, sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half, and it starts with the confidence that we have around the new products that we're bringing to market,\" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the earnings call.\n\nWill innovation boost Nike's stock?

        "body": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has experienced many struggles since its 1980 IPO. After its board fired Steve Jobs in 1985, the company spent years in the wilderness. It suspended its dividend payout in 1996, and was close to bankruptcy when it brought Jobs back in 1997.\n\nShortly after that, Apple stock began a run that made it one of the most successful stocks in history, illustrating how innovation can dramatically improve a company's fortunes.\n\nApple's stock growth since Jobs' return\n\nIf one had bought $1,000 in Apple stock when Jobs returned in February 1997 and held on until today, that position would be worth around $1.8 million. That figure assumes this hypothetical investor would have reinvested their income from the dividend, which Apple reinstated in 2012.\n\nAAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nJobs' first major move after returning was to integrate the Mac ecosystem with the broader tech world, convincing Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple and develop and support a Mac-compatible version of its popular Office software.\n\nHe also set to build an Apple ecosystem, revamping the Macintosh, launching the iMac in 1998, and following up with a new MacOS in 2001. The company gained additional traction by launching the iPod music player in 2001, and opening Apple Stores and the iTunes Store soon after.\n\nHowever, the innovation that truly transformed Apple was the iPhone, which it launched in 2007. It pioneered the modern smartphone industry, and eventually eliminated many people's need to own a PC. So successful was the iPhone that it drives the majority of Apple's revenue to this day.\n\nApple's pace of innovation slowed with the passing of Jobs in 2011.

        "body": "A 65-year-old woman examines whether it makes sense to convert her $1.2 million IRA into a Roth IRA.\n\nImagine you\u2019re 65 with $1.2 million in an IRA and a lingering question: should you convert your account into a Roth IRA? The answer may depend on how you go about it. A Roth conversion can provide some sizable advantages, including tax-free withdrawals and freedom from mandated distributions \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always the right move.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no prohibition or disadvantage to a Roth conversion based on your age at 65, converting the entire $1.2 million all at once will burden you with a larger tax bill than you may want to pay in a single year. If you use partial Roth conversions tailored to your situation, however, you can significantly reduce your tax burden and also provide for a tax-free inheritance later. If you need additional guidance surrounding Roth conversions and other retirement planning topics, speak with a financial advisor today.\n\nRoth IRA Conversion Concepts\n\nA Roth conversion shifts retirement money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Traditional pre-tax IRAs let you deduct contributions from taxable income when you contribute, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed according to your income tax bracket that year.\n\nRoth IRA contributions use after-tax dollars, so you don\u2019t get a tax break when you make contributions. Qualified withdrawals can be made tax-free later, though. Another big plus is that Roth accounts are not subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs), which can bump you into a higher tax bracket in retirement. Without RMDs, Roth funds can stay invested and grow tax-free forever, being passed down to your heirs if that\u2019s part of your estate plan. There\u2019s also no income limit on Roth conversions, unlike direct contributions to a Roth IRA that can only be made by individuals with less than $161,000 in modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) and married couples filing jointly with MAGI less than $240,000.\n\nBut Roth conversions carry a significant catch. The money you convert in a given year becomes ordinary income in the year in which it\u2019s converted. That means paying taxes on that money \u2013 lots of them potentially. Turning $1.2 million into taxable Roth conversion income could trigger the 37% top federal rate, plus state taxes in most states. One alternative approach for reducing this potential tax hit is to do partial conversions, spreading a large amount over several years to avoid bumping you into a higher bracket.\n\nAnd if you want to talk through your options with an expert, consider using this free matching tool to find a financial advisor.\n\nLump Sum vs. Incremental Conversions\n\nA Roth conversion can provide tax flexibility in retirement. However, it may not make sense for everyone.\n\nAs a single 65-year-old with $1.2 million in a traditional IRA, let\u2019s assume you collect $24,000 in annual Social Security income, which is slightly more than the most recent average retirement benefit of $1,856 per month. If you converted the full $1.2 million IRA balance to a Roth IRA in 2023 and took the standard deduction ($15,700 in 2023 for people 65 and older), all or nearly all of the converted amount could be subject to the top tax rate of 37%. This could result in a one-time tax federal income bill of over $398,000 due in April 2024, plus more if state taxes apply.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeed help with a Roth conversion? Find a financial advisor today.\n\nThere may be a better way, though. Spreading the $1.2 million conversion over 10 years at $120,000 per year puts you in the 22% tax bracket in tax year 2023 after taking the standard deduction. That means paying approximately $18,430 in federal taxes annually on the portion that gets converted. Over the decade, that totals around $184,300 for a total tax savings of roughly $214,000. (While tax brackets change from year to year, we\u2019re assuming you\u2019ll remain in the 24% bracket for simplicity\u2019s sake.)\n\nPeople under 59.5 years old should be mindful of the five-year rule when doing a Roth conversion. Withdrawing money from a Roth account less than five years after a conversion may trigger a 10% penalty. However, that rule doesn't apply to people who are 59.5 or older, as well as others who qualify for certain exceptions.\n\nMore Roth Conversion Considerations\n\nThere are some other factors to keep in mind. For one, adding taxable income from a Roth conversion may increase taxes on your Social Security benefits. You may also have to pay higher Medicare premiums and lose access to some tax credits.\n\nAlso, the money you leave in the Roth while doing partial conversions will likely continue to grow, so you\u2019ll have to convert more than $120,000 in later years to empty the account. Furthermore, future tax rates may increase. These uncertainties mean that any projections of taxes owed on the gradual conversion plan may vary significantly from the actual amounts you\u2019ll owe. Converting everything now provides certainty \u2013 you\u2019ll know exactly how much you have to pay.\n\nDeciding If a Roth Conversion Is Right\n\nA 65-year-old couple looks over their retirement savings and weighs whether a Roth conversion is worth it.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts when evaluating a large Roth conversion. You may want to follow this process and speak with a financial advisor to get a better understanding of how this maneuver will affect your outlook:\n\nDetermine how you want to handle IRA money at your death. If the objective is completely tax-free inheritance, calculated partial Roth conversions can maintain that tax-free growth for heirs over time.\n\nCompare current and future expected tax rates. Paying taxes now on a lump sum conversion or a series of larger conversions may ultimately save you if tax rates increase in the future.\n\nConsider other elements of your financial plan. Examine your income streams, multi-year tax outlook, healthcare costs and estate plan. To pick the Roth conversion method that fits you best will likely require a careful and comprehensive analysis of your financial outlook.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile you can do a Roth conversion at any age, converting an entire $1.2 million IRA into a Roth account all at once will typically saddle you with a large tax bill. However, partial Roth conversions tailored specifically for you can help considerably. Check retirement spending plans, estate planning, health budgets and more before opting for a conversion. Also, consider potential changes to tax rates in the future and how they could impact you.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nA financial advisor can help you evaluate whether a Roth IRA conversion makes sense for you. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now, get started now.\n\nSmartAsset\u2019s Social Security calculator is a quick and easy way to project the size of your monthly check after you claim your benefits. If you\u2019re considering relocating to a new state for retirement, it\u2019s important to assess the tax environment of that state. SmartAsset\u2019s retirement tax friendliness tool can help you do that.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/designer491, \u00a9iStock.com/Pekic, \u00a9iStock.com/insta_photos\n\nThe post I\u2019m 65 Years Old With $1.2 Million in an IRA.

        "body": "How to Earn $500 Per Month From Caterpillar In Dividends Following The Latest Dividend Increase\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWith three decades of consistent dividend increases and a roughly 40% gain in stock price over the past year, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the most notable dividend stocks in the market. Analysts believe Caterpillar is a defensive play for long-term investors as the company is positioned well to benefit from the expected increase in infrastructure spending in the U.S. and the global economic boom. Caterpillar's business is diversified across construction equipment, power generation, energy and transportation, with increasing exposure to electrification, digital solutions and alternative fuels.\n\nCaterpillar stock has a new growth catalyst: backup power generators for data centers. As tech companies establish data centers worldwide to power their generative AI apps, they need data centers with uninterrupted power access. Caterpillar's reciprocating engines for data centers are already seeing a rise in demand. During the first-quarter earnings call, Caterpillar's management said the company plans a \"multiyear capital investment\" in its reciprocating engine division to double its output for large engines and aftermarket parts compared with last year.\n\nCaterpillar's P/E ratio is around 15 as of June 25, which is low compared to the industry average of 18. While Caterpillar's growth is facing headwinds amid a decline in construction activity in residential markets in the US and Europe, analysts believe the company is set to see a rebound in growth following the beginning of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Wall Street expects Caterpillar's earnings to grow 5% next year and 7% per annum on average for the next five years. However, these growth estimates can increase amid Caterpillar's expansion into new business segments such as AI, data analytics and alternative fuels.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nIn addition to these growth catalysts, Caterpillar's shareholder returns are also increasing. During the first quarter, the company allocated $5.1 billion for share repurchases and dividends. Over the past five years, the company's dividend has grown at a CAGR of 8.6%. The stock's payout ratio is 25%, which means the company allocates a substantial amount of cash to future growth.\n\nIn this backdrop, it'd be interesting to know how you can earn $500 monthly in dividends from Caterpillar. Let's find out.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Earn $500 a Month From Caterpillar Following the Latest Dividend Hike\n\nBefore we begin, it's important to note that since Caterpillar increased its quarterly dividend to $1.41 per share from $1.30 on June 12, we'd be using the latest dividend for our calculations. However, please keep in mind that the new dividend is payable on August 20 to shareholders of record on July 22.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the number of Caterpillar shares you need to buy to reach your income goal. An income of $500 per month means you will generate $6,000 per year in dividends from Caterpillar. Assuming a dividend of $1.41 per share (new dividend after the latest increase, effective August 20), Caterpillar's annual dividend comes out to be $5.64 ($1.41 x 4 = $5.64).\n\nNumber of shares needed = $6,000 / $5.64 = 1,063.829\n\nTo earn $500 a month from Caterpillar, you need to buy about 1,064 shares of the company.\n\nTotal Investment Needed to Earn $500 a Month from Caterpillar Dividends\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the investment you need to make in Caterpillar to reach the $500/month dividend goal. We will multiply the total number of shares by the stock\u2019s latest price. CAT closed at $330 on June 24.\n\nTotal Investment Needed to Earn $500/month from Caterpillar in Dividends = $330 x 1,064 = $351,120\n\nTo earn $500 monthly in dividends from Caterpillar, you\u2019d need to invest about $351,120 in the company.\n\nEquityMultiple Ascent Income Fund:\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "body": "Companies today generate mountains of data. That data can be of great value -- but only if it's correctly harnessed, visualized, and used to improve decision-making. Often, though, that data lives in a variety of different software systems, with various chunks siloed away in platforms that can't communicate with each other, complicating any effort to see the full picture. For instance, a corporation may have a customer services database, enterprise management software, a marketing platform, and more. Unifying the data from all of these platforms into one system and mining the integrated result for actionable insights is Palantir's (NYSE: PLTR) specialty, and why its services are in demand.\n\nThe Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is its latest innovation, and it's loaded with potential.\n\nClients are flocking to Palantir AIP\n\nImagine a wholesale supplier facing a severe weather event affecting one of its centers. Management needs to know the most efficient alternative methods for keeping its customers supplied, and what effect its choices will have on margins. Or perhaps you manage planning a company's inventory levels, and you need to know what impact a price increase or decrease will have on demand. Or you want to automate your payment processing to suppliers by unifying documents like purchase orders, invoices, and warehouse receipts. These are all use cases for Palantir's AIP.\n\nAIP uses large language models that enable its clients to ask questions like those in plain English and receive actionable responses. Selling a platform this complex is difficult. Examining use cases for other companies is helpful, but it is still difficult to visualize how a platform like AIP will work in a specific company. Because of this, Palantir conducts \"boot camps\" where potential customers build use cases unique to their businesses in just days. These have proven a terrific tool to increase Palantir's client base -- its U.S. commercial customer count is exploding.\n\nSource: Palantir.\n\nIn the first quarter, that translated to a 40% year-over-year increase in U.S. commercial sales to $150 million and 27% worldwide commercial sales growth to $299 million. Government revenue grew by a slower 16% to $335 million. Penetrating the commercial market will be critical to Palantir's long-term success.\n\nTotal sales in Q1 rose 21% year over year to $634 million, and Palantir increased its profitability. But not everyone is convinced.\n\nExamining the Palantir bear case\n\nPalantir enjoys a large following among retail investors, and has inspired spirited debates between its bulls and bears over the last several years. The company is methodically putting many of the bear arguments to bed. I'll take you through two of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, many lamented the company's persistent unprofitability. This was legitimate criticism as the company racked up annual losses until 2023, when it achieved profitability. Palantir has posted net profits in the last six quarters and dramatically increased operating profits.\n\nPLTR Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSecond, Palantir bears pointed out the company's extensive use of stock-based compensation to reward employees. The most significant portion of such distributions usually goes to the top executives. The result of issuing a large number of new shares to pay your team, however, is that the number of outstanding shares increases and shareholders' portions of the pie decrease. However, Palantir has been dialing back its stock-based compensation as its revenue has been ramping up.\n\nPLTR Stock Based Compensation (TTM) Chart\n\nUsing stock-based compensation also helps companies preserve their cash. Palantir finished Q1 with $3.9 billion in cash and investments on its books and no long-term debt.\n\nIs Palantir stock a buy?\n\nAnother reason some investors remain in the Palantir bear camp is its high valuation. The stock trades at nearly 25 times current sales. That's a lower price-to-sales ratio than CrowdStrike and a higher one than Snowflake -- both of which, like Palantir, are high-growth software companies with market caps below $100 billion.\n\nPLTR PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock is also trading at a higher valuation than its historical average. However, Palantir is the most profitable of these three tech companies. Over its last four reported quarters, Palantir produced nearly $200 million in operating profits, compared to $24 million for CrowdStrike and a loss of $1.2 billion for Snowflake.\n\nInvestors can afford to be patient if they choose to buy Palantir stock. The best strategy would be to build your stake in it gradually and regularly over time so you can take advantage of any dips in the price that might occur. A dollar-cost averaging strategy can reduce short-term risk when investing in high-priced stocks.\n\nPalantir has entrenched itself as a leader in data and artificial intelligence management. Although its valuation is high, its profits are growing and it's in a strong financial position to excel over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Bounce Back in the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "It's been a rough first half for some investors. If you owned shares of UiPath (NYSE: PATH), Chegg (NYSE: CHGG), and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) since the start of 2024, you're in a world of hurt. The three stocks are down between 36% and 74% so far this year.\n\nIt doesn't have to stay that way. I think all three stocks have a chance to deliver meaningful gains in the final six months of 2024. They may not make back the ground they lost in the first half of this year, but even a modest bounce from these humble starting lines can beat the market. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. UiPath, Down 49%\n\nIt's hard to believe that UiPath has been roughly cut in half this year. As a leading provider of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence software solutions, this should be a fertile stock in 2024. Between wage inflation driving labor expenses higher and companies trying to gain an operational edge, UiPath's tech platform for robotic process automation should be a dinner bell. So far this year, it's been a fire alarm.\n\nUiPath's biggest hit came in late May following a poorly received quarterly report. Weak guidance and losing its second CEO this year weren't bullish events. Now it's time to see if the dramatic markdown here is ripe for a comeback story.\n\nUiPath began the year with a pair of CEOs. Co-founder Daniel Dines, who was serving as co-CEO, stepped down in January. His fellow helmsman backed out at the end of May following the brutal financial update after just a couple of months as lone CEO. Dines agreed to return to the corner office.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowth has slowed at UiPath. The 16% revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter is about half the year-over-year jump it posted three months earlier. Its latest guidance suggests that the top line will continue to decelerate. The news isn't necessarily any better on the bottom line. UiPath remains profitable on an adjusted basis, but it's not expected to return to reported profitability until 2027.\n\nWhy should one be optimistic in the near term here? Well, despite the uninspiring guidance for the balance of 2024, analysts see revenue accelerating from 8% this fiscal year to 12% next year. It has a cash-rich balance sheet that shaves its current $7.3 billion market cap to an enterprise value of just $5.4 billion. It's going through some hiccups, but it still topped $100 million in adjusted free cash flow in its latest quarter, and it has found a way to exceed Wall Street's profit targets in each of the last four quarters. Dines is back, and what a great name to ring the dinner bell again.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Chegg, Down 74%\n\nThe biggest sinker on this list is Chegg. The homework help specialist has been reeling since warning that ChatGPT is eating away at its business nearly 14 months ago. It was sputtering before it said the obvious. It has posted negative year-over-year revenue growth for eight consecutive quarters. However, those were single-digit top-line declines. Guidance calls for a slide of 12% to 13% in the current quarter.\n\nChegg knows the assignment. It's a study help pro, after all. The new CEO who took over last month was the chief operating officer who set the company on the track to embrace AI to avoid disruption well before the market knew there was a problem. Chegg also remains very profitable. It's trading for less than 3 times trailing and forward adjusted earnings. The multiple is still less than five if you prefer to go with enterprise value instead of market cap. The price-to-free-cash-flow multiple is even lower.\n\nChegg is a money tree, but it has mistakenly spent a lot of that greenery on buying back shares at much higher price points. It spent more than $300 million on repurchases last year alone, more than enough to swallow its entire remaining share count at today's deeply discounted prices. Last week it announced that it would be reducing its workforce by 23%, a move that will help shave costs as it puts more effort into leading the way in AI-fueled educational tools.\n\n3. Roku, Down 36%\n\nLet's close with Roku. The popular TV streaming enabler is doing well on some fronts. Revenue and user counts are growing in the double digits, and engagement has never been stronger. However, a lack of profitability, near-term competitive concerns, and sluggish connected TV advertising growth are weighing on the niche pioneer.\n\nRoku is volatile, and it has a knack for bouncing back after a sell-off. The stock isn't likely to return to its 2021 peak anytime soon, but the business is a lot larger and its reach much wider since then. If recent efforts to prioritize initiatives that will deliver strong early returns pay off, Roku will be more than just a four-letter word to investors who have been burned in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc\n\nWarren Buffett revealed he owns about $600 million of assets apart from Berkshire Hathaway stock.\n\nThe investor said his Berkshire A shares, worth $127 billion, represent 99.5% of his net worth.\n\nHe likely keeps most of his remaining wealth in his private portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n\nWarren Buffett just revealed he has about $600 million of personal wealth outside of his Berkshire Hathaway stock.\n\nThe famed investor and Berkshire CEO announced on Friday that he's donated another $5.3 billion of his company's shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four of his family's foundations. He noted that the gifts, based on their value when received, total around $55 billion over the last 18 years.\n\n\"I have no debts and my remaining A shares are worth about $127 billion, roughly 99\u00bd% of my net worth,\" he added.\n\nBuffett's comment suggests the remaining 0.5% or about $600 million of his fortune is in other assets. The financial guru owns about $1 million of Berkshire's cheaper B shares, and his Omaha home is worth an estimated $1.4 million.\n\nEven if Buffett possesses other physical assets worth a few million dollars, it seems likely his private portfolio of stocks and bonds accounts for the bulk of his non-Berkshire wealth.\n\nAfter all, he's personally owned at least $80 million worth of just three stocks \u2014 Wells Fargo, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 in years past, ProPublica reported last year based on leaked Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data.\n\nBuffett also sold at least $466 million of stock between 2000 and 2019, and disposed of bonds worth much more, ProPublica said. The story pointed to a private portfolio worth hundreds of millions of dollars just a few years back.\n\nThe investor's latest hint supports that idea. It also helps explain how Buffett can afford to only collect a $100,000 salary from Berkshire, and return half that amount to the company each year.\n\nBuffett likely earns meaningful amounts of stock dividends and bond income from his personal holdings, which spares him from having to sell Berkshire shares to pay his bills.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "title": "After Nvidia's Stock Split and 150% First-Half Gain, Will It Soar in the Second Half? Here's What History Says.",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has probably been the most watched stock on the planet over the past several months. This is because the company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and its soaring revenue has prompted the stock to skyrocket. In the first half, the shares soared more than 150% -- and that's after already gaining more than 1,300% in the previous five years.\n\nIn fact, this momentum pushed Nvidia stock past the threshold of $1,000, a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors -- and in other cases makes it difficult for small investors to buy without relying on fractional shares. So Nvidia launched a stock split recently to bring down the price of each individual share. Investors welcomed the news, and the stock rallied nearly 30% from the split announcement through the actual operation.\n\nNow, though, the big question is whether Nvidia's momentum will continue post-split and whether this top chip designer will soar in the second half. Let's look to history for some answers.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLooking at historical patterns\n\nFirst, it's important to note that just because a certain pattern occurred in the past doesn't guarantee the same pattern will continue in the future. So, any conclusions we draw may guide us -- but they aren't set in stone. The market or a particular stock may surprise us.\n\nThat said, patterns do replicate frequently enough to make them worth our consideration. They may offer us an idea of what generally happens after a certain event, making us aware of likely possibilities.\n\nLet's move on to the idea of stock splits and what history shows. A stock split, through the issuance of new shares to current holders, lowers the price of each individual share -- but without changing the market value of the company or the valuation of the stock. So, the operation hasn't changed anything fundamental about the particular company or stock.\n\nBut the split accomplishes one major thing: It opens the investment opportunity up to a broader range of investors. This is positive for you and me because it makes it easier for us to invest in a company like Nvidia, and it's positive for the company because it offers it a whole new audience of potential investors. So it's a win-win situation. Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split brought the stock price down from more than $1,000 to about $125.\n\nStock splits in and of themselves, since they're just mechanical operations, aren't catalysts for stock performance -- you wouldn't buy a stock just because the company launched a split. But, as you can see in the chart, below, history shows that stock split players tend to outperform the S&P 500 in the 12 months following the stock split announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nData source: Statista.\n\nThe chart shows that stock split companies have generated an average total return of more than 25% in that 12-month period. That's compared to less than 12% for the S&P 500 as a whole. This is based on Bank of America's Research Investment Committee data from 1980 through today.\n\nNvidia's past stock splits\n\nNow we can dig deeper by looking at Nvidia itself after its past two stock splits, in 2007 and 2021. After both, the stock declined in the 12 months that followed -- but first, the shares advanced in the two to five months after the operation. Nvidia stock climbed more than 60% in the five months following the 2021 split and added about 17% in the six-week period following the 2007 split.\n\nSo, what does all of this tell us about what may happen today? It's important to keep in mind that Nvidia's business has greatly evolved since the past stock splits. Then, it mainly served the video gaming industry and progressively was moving into other areas, such as AI. Today, the high-growth field of AI is the company's main business, making the stock significantly more attractive to investors. So Nvidia may have stronger momentum today than it did after previous splits -- and that might make a lasting rally possible.\n\nThis can happen if Nvidia continues to report impressive earnings growth and deliver on product launch goals. And things look promising. Nvidia has reported quarter after quarter of record revenue and says demand for its soon-to-launch Blackwell architecture and chip surpasses supply. And speaking of Blackwell, this launch, too, could be a positive catalyst for the stock.\n\nAll of this means it's very possible Nvidia stock will soar in the second half, thanks to the company's leadership in a high-growth market and solid revenue prospects. And the best news is this: Even if history is wrong and Nvidia doesn't rally in the coming months, this top stock still has what it takes to deliver big returns to investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Walgreens' (WBA) stock is down more than 50% this year as the company continues to face retail headwinds and pivots to a brand new strategy for the pharmacy chain.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth, who has been on the job for eight months, laid out an aggressive plan to revamp the company on its third quarter earnings call Thursday.\n\nThe future Wentworth envisions is one in which pharmacies are local hubs for healthcare access.\n\nThe health ecosystem idealizes pharmacies \u2014 chains, independents, and online \u2014 as a way to maintain patient health. They have also been viewed as expert consultants in the case of minor healthcare needs ranging from advice on over-the-counter products to helping administer specialty drugs on site.\n\nWentworth wants to double down on that idea by investing in technology to help automate tasks for pharmacists in order to free them up for patients' needs.\n\n\"I am confident WBA will be a leader in the future of healthcare, with pharmacy and retail at its center,\" Wentworth said.\n\nHowever, that strategy hasn't worked in the past.\n\nTough economics\n\nThe idea of your friendly neighborhood pharmacist clashes with the economics of running a pharmacy and how they get paid by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nIt's the struggle pharmacies of all sizes face with ever-decreasing reimbursements from the three largest pharmacy benefit managers: CVS Caremark (CVS), UnitedHealth's Optum Rx (UNH), and Cigna's Express Scripts (CI), where Wentworth previously served as CEO.\n\nWentworth said he is fighting \"to align incentives and ensure we are paid fairly.\"\n\nPharmacies have been fighting since before the pandemic. The impact of consumer trends on front-of-store sales (for beauty and food items), as well as the pressure of being paid fairly for prescriptions, has been the focus of earnings calls for years \u2014 and was a catalyst for both Walgreens' and CVS's healthcare services strategy.\n\nCOVID offered a brief reprieve for pharmacies, with increased revenues from vaccines, testing, and the need for over-the-counter medications.\n\nThat has since tapered off, forcing pharmacies to reduce business hours, close stores, and reconsider how to best utilize storefronts to serve evolving patient needs.\n\nIn this June 4, 2014, file photo, people walk into a Walgreens retail store in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nLong-term view\n\nOne area in which Walgreens is ahead of the competition is clinical trials.\n\nThe company has been converting walk-in clinic spaces into clinical trial spaces and successfully clinched a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced requirements for drug companies to diversify their clinical trial participant pool, for which Walgreens is now well poised.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that didn't stop the sell-off Thursday on the news that the company would be struggling in the short term. It lead to the worst day for the company in nearly four decades, closing 22% lower Thursday.\n\nMost analysts believe the company is employing a solid strategy, but it will require patience to execute, especially as a key source of revenue, PBMs, are increasingly becoming competition.\n\nJPMorgan's Lisa Gill said in a note late Thursday that the process would take time.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in the longer-term, WBA has the potential for growth. If there is a silver lining to this print, we believe that the company is making the necessary steps to stabilize its footprint and working with PBMs and payors to manage reimbursement headwinds,\" she wrote.\n\nBank of America's Allen Lutz similarly noted, \"It is imperative that Walgreens pushes back more assertively against PBMs to capture a more reasonable return on capital.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is not fully clear if a more aggressive push by retail pharmacies would yield favorable results. However, the risk from continuing down the current path for WBA may prove worse.\"\n\nWalgreens is the largest retail pharmacy chain, with nearly 10,000 locations. Competitor CVS has more than 9,000, and RiteAid \u2014 which is currently in bankruptcy even after Walgreens acquired nearly 2,000 locations \u2014 has less than 2,000.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "body": "The leader of America's biggest bank wants to see schools doing more to bring students up to pace with the working world, instead of leaving it to businesses to bridge the gap.\n\nJamie Dimon has long been an advocate of getting younger people into well-paid positions, and believes schools should be monitored on whether their students launch careers after they graduate as opposed to whether they go to college.\n\nThis week Dimon\u2014who oversees more than 240,000 employees worldwide\u2014doubled down on that stance.\n\n\"Businesses have to hire a lot of people and they have to train them, so when the school system doesn't do it, it makes this harder for companies,\" he told Axios in an interview released Thursday.\n\n\"What you need in a lot of these things is, certificates and training that get them the good job.\"\n\nDimon\u2014who was paid a record $36 million for his work in 2023\u2014also pushed back on the notion that his work to get younger people and underrepresented communities into the workplace is a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) exercise.\n\nThe Harvard Business School graduate was speaking in relation to his position as the executive chairman of the New York Jobs CEO Council\u2014a coalition of some of the largest employers in the Big Apple.\n\nAlso on the board are Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nA father of three, Dimon rejected the implication that his work on the council was linked to DEI\u2014a topic that has split opinion among the nation's top CEOs.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase chairman said he was \"not interested in labels\" and added that the jobs council had \"nothing to do with DEI.\"\n\n\"This has to do with the system isn't working and needs to be fixed,\" he said. \"It is part of our job [as CEOs and companies] to lift up society. You call that whatever you want\u2026 If we leave behind whole parts of society, we're making a huge mistake for our country.\"\n\nJudging school quality\n\nDimon's sentiments echo thoughts he shared earlier this year about what factors should be considered when establishing whether a school is of good quality.\n\nHe told Indianapolis-based WISH-TV in March: \u201cIf you look at kids they gotta be educated to get jobs. Too much focus in education has been on graduating college\u2026 It should be on jobs. I think the schools should be measured on, did the kids get out and get a good job?\"\n\nDimon pointed out that a 17-year-old bank teller could make $40,000 a year, adding: \u201cAnd if you happen to have a family at 18 or whatever, you get $20,000 in medical benefit for your family. You can be a welder, you can be a coder, you could be cyber, you could be automotive\u2014all of those jobs are $40,000 to $60,000, $70,000 a year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cJobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Dimon repeated. \u201cThere are a lot of efforts taking place around the country but I think we\u2019ve fallen behind as a nation.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nIt seems students themselves are also thinking differently about what they want to get out of their education.\n\nEducation data specialists National Clearing House reported in January that undergraduate enrollment grew 1.2% in the fall of 2023\u2014the first time since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBut within that picture is significant growth in vocational subjects\u2014courses designed to help students learn in a practical way to prepare them for a skills-based role.\n\nThe database reported that at community colleges with a high vocational program focus, enrollment grew 16% in the same period, bringing them above fall 2019 levels.\n\nAs Sam Pillar, cofounder and CEO at Jobber, wrote for Fortune earlier this month: \"Homes and other infrastructure are getting older. Today, the median owner-occupied home in the U.S. is 40 years old, which means there\u2019s a growing need for repairs, maintenance, and remodeling of the aging housing stock.\n\n\"At the same time, skilled workers are retiring, and there aren\u2019t enough young people coming into the trades to take their place\u2026 This leads to delays in service and drives up the cost for consumers. The labor shortage is a major problem but also a massive opportunity for ambitious young people to come in and fill the gap. Thankfully, we\u2019re seeing Gen Z show an interest in seizing this opportunity.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "body": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock shot higher after it announced a surprising new deal with global auto giant Volkswagen earlier this week. As investors digest more details of the multifaceted arrangement, some are taking quick gains from the stock's jump.\n\nToday, Rivian shares were lower by 7.7% as of 2:45 p.m. ET. At that time, the stock was still up nearly 30% for the week. So what are investors to make of the volatility in Rivian shares?\n\nRivian's Investor Day lays it all out\n\nTo recap the partnership news, Volkswagen will be investing up to $5 billion in Rivian to gain a share of its software and electric vehicle (EV) technologies. That includes a $1 billion investment up front in the form of a convertible note. A $2 billion common stock investment and another $2 billion to set up an EV technology joint venture (JV) will follow, subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nWhat might have investors taking profits today is the reality that Volkswagen's investment isn't the guaranteed lifeline that some investors may have initially assumed. For one thing, it will be dilutive to existing shareholders. The conversion price of the note will be below $11 per share. That's more than 50% below where Rivian stock was trading heading into 2024. Volkswagen's investment will also only help get Rivian to the point where it's shipping its next-generation R2 models in 2026 if it continues to rein in spending.\n\nManagement spelled out its cost-cutting plans in its Investor Day presentation Thursday evening. While it plans 20% in material cost reductions through the balance of this year, the bulk of savings is expected to be next year as it begins production on the R2 models. Capital expenditure reductions totaling $2.5 billion will also flow through 2025.\n\nThe extended timeline and coming dilution has some investors taking profits today. For long-term investors, though, this week was an overall bullish one for Rivian.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $759,759!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- After a blistering rally driven by the biggest technology stocks pushing the S&P 500 to a string of all-time highs this year, it\u2019s \u201ca good time to tap the brakes,\u201d according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s Tony Pasquariello.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bull market, but the probability of a drawdown is rising,\u201d Pasquariello, the bank\u2019s global head of hedge fund coverage, wrote in a note to clients Friday. \u201cSo I would look for places to reduce overall portfolio risk as we navigate the next phase of the political game.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 closed at 5,460.48 Friday after hitting 31 record highs this year, in an artificial intelligence-fueled rally. This came as Wall Street traders boosted bullish bets on US stocks amid resilient corporate earnings and signs of cooling inflation that reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will be able to start cutting interest rates this year.\n\nTo Pasquariello, the market still gets fundamental support from easing financial conditions and US mega-cap tech stocks. \u201cAs long as the economy is growing, and earnings are growing, significant selloffs are very rare,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDespite this strength and momentum, he sees a few growing risks to the bullish narrative. They include a widening fiscal deficit, a build-up of stock exposure among households and institutional investors as well as the narrow breadth of the rally driven by some of the biggest stocks. \u201cThe history book tells us the risk of a selloff increases as the rally narrows,\u201c he warned.\n\nPasquariello said investors could take advantage of the low cost of downside protection and hedge portfolios with put options, as well as so-called lookback put options that allow the holder to exercise a derivative at the most beneficial price of the underlying asset, over the life of the option. In the meantime, he suggests to keep the highest quality equity exposure.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "A powerful start to 2024 had the bulls predicting $100,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} at some point this year, but relentless selling pressure during April and June (interrupted by a May bounce) has the price struggling not to drop below $60,000 as the quarter draws to a close.\n\nEntering the second quarter, bitcoin was trading just shy of the $71,000 level and at press time (about 60 hours before Q2 officially closes) was changing hands at $60,800, a decline of more than 14%. Helped by the tailwind of what now appears to be certain spot ETF approval, ether {{ETH}} outperformed, but was still in the red in the second quarter with about a 5% drop.\n\nDragged down by even larger declines in many altcoins, the broader CoinDesk Index fell more than 21% during the last three months. Among the movers, Solana {{SOL}} tumbled 30%, Ripple's {{XRP}} dropped 23% and Dogecoin {{DOGE}} plunged 42%. The index's best performer was the above-mentioned ether with its 5% slide.\n\nPositive catalysts vanish\n\nBitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from January 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-March of this year.\n\nAnticipation of the spot bitcoin ETF approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise. Also in play were macro factors \u2013 namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation, however, has failed to cooperate, and to date there has been no easing of monetary policy in the U.S., with more than one member of the central bank now not expecting to cut rates even once this year.\n\nWith ETF inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.\n\nMore pain in store in Q3?\n\nBitcoin entered a downtrend on June 20, writes Markus Thielen at 10X Research, laying out ten reasons why the price could decline to $55,000 in the near term. Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.\n\nIn addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor Donald Trump \u2013 who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin \u2013 Thielen suggested President Biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement Democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the November election.\n\nStory continues\n\nThielen also reminded about seasonality. The third quarter has historically been the weakest one, with an average return of just 5% over the past 13 years. This compares to average returns above 60% in both the second and fourth quarters.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Why AT&T (NYSE:T) Is a Top Dividend Stock Worth Watching",
        "body": "Telecom company AT&T (NYSE:T) has historically attracted investors with its mature business model characterized by low volatility and a high dividend yield supported by robust cash flows. Despite lacking strong growth prospects, the company consistently pays steady dividends with relatively low risk.\n\nRecent turbulent years have contradicted these strengths, but AT&T has since reorganized by refocusing on its core business. It is poised to remain a strong dividend performer for years to come, which is why I hold a bullish stance on the company.\n\nT\u2019s Dividend Yield Remains Highly Compelling\n\nAT&T has been a consistent dividend payer since the company went public in the 1980s, establishing itself as a benchmark in dividend investing for decades.\n\nHowever, starting in 2022, the company made a significant quarterly dividend cut of almost 50%, reducing it from $0.52 to $0.28, which marked the end of a 35-year streak of dividend increases for AT&T. The decision was necessitated by the company\u2019s high debt levels, which reached about 3.6 times net debt to EBITDA, primarily due to two large and ultimately unsuccessful acquisitions (DirecTV and Time Warner) that resulted in substantial losses.\n\nAs depicted in the graph below, AT&T\u2019s dividend yield trajectory has sharply declined since 2021. Currently, the company offers a yield of around 6% (with a payout ratio of 47% of its profits), significantly higher than the telecom sector average of 2.5% and well above the PCE inflation rate of 2.7%. Despite the recent pullback, AT&T remains a compelling income stock alternative.\n\nDividend Safety: Management Likely Won\u2019t Let Shareholders Down\n\nOver the past two years, AT&T\u2019s investment thesis has taken a hit, raising questions about its sustainability. However, since 2022, the company has reported stable quarterly dividends.\n\nIn 2023, AT&T generated $20.46 billion in free cash flow (FCF) and paid out $8.13 billion in dividends, implying that only 39% of FCF was used for dividends. This suggests the company has substantial room to maneuver if its cash flow decreases, potentially avoiding dividend cuts, a reduction in business reinvestment, or an increase in borrowing.\n\nThis is a significant improvement compared to 2022, when 77% of its FCF was allocated to dividends. It\u2019s important to note that in 2022, AT&T\u2019s cash flows were adversely affected by specific operations. The year marked a strategic shift to focus on its core telecom business, including the completion of the WarnerMedia spinoff. This divestiture reduced AT&T\u2019s revenue and cash flow from media operations, impacting overall FCF.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, AT&T significantly increased its capital expenditures by investing in 5G infrastructure and expanding its fiber network. These investments, while crucial for maintaining competitiveness, resulted in higher immediate cash outflows, reducing FCF in the short term.\n\nWith the normalization of cash flows in 2023, it is likely that dividend payments will remain stable over the next few years. AT&T\u2019s ability to reduce debt and aim for a 2.5x leverage target (net debt to EBITDA) by the first half of 2025 further supports this stability.\n\nCEO John Stankey\u2019s comments during AT&T\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings call indicate that management is taking a flexible approach to dividends.\n\nThey plan to adjust their dividend yield to align with prevailing economic conditions, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re very cognizant of a desire to ensure that we\u2019re treating our shareholders well. We\u2019ll evaluate at that time where things like interest rates stand. We\u2019ll evaluate where we are on the dividend yield relative to the equity value and where we have opportunities for reinvestment in the business.\u201d\n\nThe Valuation Is Relatively Discounted\n\nOn the valuation side, AT&T\u2019s 8.3x forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is almost in line with Verizon\u2019s (NYSE:VZ) 8.7x in the U.S. However, it\u2019s much lower than T-Mobile\u2019s (NASDAQ:TMUS) 19x. Looking internationally, its forward P/E is still lower compared to Vodafone\u2019s (NASDAQ:VOD) 24.2x and America Movil\u2019s (NYSE:AMX) 11.6x.\n\nUnlike its domestic peers, AT&T\u2019s strategy remains focused on its core business operations, while Verizon and T-Mobile pursue strategies based on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and new product lines. While this conservative approach may limit AT&T\u2019s growth relative to its peers, it enhances the attractiveness of its dividend thesis.\n\nDespite minimal growth estimates for AT&T through the end of 2024, with a less than 1% increase expected in its top line, the company\u2019s management sees AI as an excellent opportunity for telecoms. AI can help AT&T reduce costs, accelerate deleveraging, and boost EBITDA growth by offering enhanced services to its customers.\n\nIs AT&T Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street\u2019s sentiment towards AT&T stock is predominantly bullish, with the consensus among 12 analysts rating it as Strong Buy. Only three analysts have a Hold rating, and none are bearish. The average T stock price target among analysts stands at $21.50, indicating upside potential of 14.7% for the company.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAfter the turbulent period of the last four to five years, AT&T now appears to be in a stable position and poised to continue delivering an attractive yield to its shareholders. The company\u2019s strategy is focused on its core telecom business and deleveraging, shifting away from ambitious M&A, and it is trading at a discounted valuation compared to its peers.\n\nFurther, management at AT&T appears committed to maintaining the dividend yield at attractive levels, reflecting their dedication to shareholder value. This stabilization, coupled with the company\u2019s strategic focus and financial discipline, positions AT&T favorably for inclusion in a portfolio of high-quality, dividend-growing stocks.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Gold Falls to 1-Week Low; Euro Struggles on Weak German Consumer Data",
        "body": "Gold Falls to One-Week Low as USD Strengthens on Declining Rate Cut Hopes\n\nThe price of (XAU) fell by 0.91% on Wednesday, reaching its lowest point in a week. The decline was driven by a stronger and rising bond yields as investors lowered their bets on interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\n\"At this point, the market may very well be responding to the firmer US dollar, and we continue to price in the possibility that the Fed is unlikely to move interest rates earlier in the summer\", said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities.\n\nIndeed, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman suggested on Tuesday that holding interest rates unchanged longer might be sufficient to control inflation. However, she emphasised the central bank is ready to raise borrowing costs if needed. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, such as gold, pushing their price down in the short term.\n\nXAU/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the focus is on the US data, specifically Gross Domestic Product, Jobless Claims, and Durable Goods Orders data. Three reports will be released simultaneously at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Traders should particularly focus on the unemployment claims and durable goods data as they show a current picture of the US economy. In case the reports are stronger than expected\u2014jobless claims are lower than 230,000, while the growth in core durable goods orders is higher than 0.2%\u2014the chances of a rate cut by the Fed will decline, pushing XAU/USD higher.\n\nConversely, if the reports paint a bleak picture of the US economy, the gold price could correct upwards.\n\n\"Spot gold may keep falling into a range of $2,275\u2013$2,286 per ounce, as it is riding on a steady downtrend\", said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.\n\nAlso, today's highly anticipated debate between the two US presidential candidates may provide a turning point in the US election campaign and affect the markets.\n\nEuro Struggles On Weak German Consumer Confidence Data\n\nThe (EUR) fell by 0.32% yesterday following a weaker-than-expected German GfK Consumer Confidence report.\n\nGerman consumer confidence fell towards \u221221.8 for July, failing to meet the expected improvement towards \u221218.9 and slipping from the previous month's revised \u221221.0. Despite a gradual recovery in the German GfK Consumer Confidence survey numbers, Wednesday's disappointing result further weakened the already struggling euro.\n\n\"EUR/USD is in a 1.0660\u20131.0760 range, awaiting the first round of France's snap election on 30 June. Assuming none of the parties win an outright majority, a second round will be held on 7 July. The polls suggest President Emmanuel Macron's party will not secure an outright or relative majority\", said DBS analyst Philip Wee.\n\nMoreover, yesterday's US data revealed that new home sales for May didn't meet the expected numbers, but an upward revision for the previous month compensated for the shortfall. Additionally, US Treasury yields rose by 5\u20137 basis points across the curve. The auction of notes produced solid results, stopping through by 0.6 basis points with above-average non-dealer bidding, according to BMO Capital Markets. This indicates that investors are confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds. Consequently, the market expectation of a rate cut by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at the meeting on 18 September decreased. The probability of at least a 25-basis-point rate cut has dropped to around 60%, down from just above 70% last week, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nEUR/USD rose during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, three key macroeconomic US reports\u2014Gross Domestic Product, Jobless Claims, and Durable Goods Orders\u2014will be released simultaneously at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Overall, these reports will provide a comprehensive snapshot of the US economy's health, influencing market sentiment and the EUR/USD's direction. Traders will closely analyse the data to understand the path of the US monetary policy, which could further impact the euro. If the data suggests economic weakness, EUR/USD may continue its upward trend. However, if the reports point out a strong US economy, EUR/USD could face downward pressure.\n\nThe British Pound Drops Below the Key Level as the US Dollar Rises\n\nThe British pound (GBP) lost 0.5% on Wednesday and dropped below a 100-day simple moving average price as the US dollar continued to rise despite weaker-than-expected home sales data.\n\nhas been moving in a bearish trend since mid-June as the divergence in monetary policy expectations between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) has widened, favouring the greenback. Furthermore, GBP is under fundamental pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the U.K. elections, which are due next Thursday. Investors are unwilling to front-run the election results and place large orders in the British pound. Although the market believes that the opposition Labour Party will win a landslide election, there is uncertainty about their economic recovery plans and the potential impact on monetary policy. Currently, the central bank is under pressure to cut rates as annual inflation has slowed towards around 2%, while the economy stopped growing in April.\n\nGBP/USD was rising slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The pair will likely experience significant volatility today as Andrew John Bailey, the BOE Governor, will give a speech at 9:30 a.m. UTC, possibly providing clues on the future changes in monetary policy. Last month, Bailey said he was optimistic that data was moving in the right direction for a rate cut.\n\nIn addition, the US will release a string of important macroeconomic reports at 12:30 p.m. UTC: Gross Domestic Product, weekly Jobless Claims, and monthly Durable Goods Orders. All three reports will impact the US dollar, but the most important data is the labour market figures. If jobless claims exceed expectations, GBP/USD may rebound, possibly above 1.26500. Lower-than-expected results may extend the short-term bearish trend in GBP/USD and push the pair below the critically important 1.26000 level.",

        "body": "Dollar rises as investors digest Fed remarks\n\nDollar/yen breaks 160, triggers intervention warnings\n\nWall Street trades in the green, AI still the main driver\n\nTo Cut or Not to Cut in September?\n\nThe traded higher against all its major counterparts on Wednesday, gaining the most ground against the . Today, the greenback is stabilizing or pulling back.\n\nWith no major events on yesterday\u2019s agenda to drive the dollar, it seems that traders continued to digest hawkish remarks by Fed policymakers. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated the view that holding interest rates steady \u201cfor some time\u201d may be enough to tame inflation, while Governor Lisa Cook noted that lowering borrowing costs will be appropriate \u201cat some point\u201d, remaining vague about the timing of the first reduction.\n\nFed Governors are permanent rate setters and that\u2019s maybe why their remarks are taken seriously by the investment community. Indeed, although the number of basis points worth of rate cuts by the end of the year remained at around 45, the probability of a first reduction in September eased to around 68%.\n\nAttention will now turn back to economic releases and tomorrow\u2019s core PCE price index for May, which is the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation metric. The forecast is for a slowdown, which is supported by the slide in the core CPI rate for the month. This could prompt traders to re-increase their September cut bets and thereby result in a pullback in the US dollar.\n\nYen Intervention Risks Rise\n\nThe yen was the main loser, even as Japan\u2019s 10-year government bond (JGB) yield edged north. Dollar/yen emerged above the round number of 160, whose breach triggered two intervention episodes around two months ago, with the pair hitting its highest level since December 1986.\n\nConsidering that the Summary of Opinions from the latest BoJ gathering increased speculation for a July hike, a still-tumbling yen appears to be a strange development. Perhaps investors are still attracted by dollar-based assets, trying to take advantage of interest rates at 5.25-5.5% before the Fed starts lowering them. US rates are much higher than the BoJ\u2019s short-term rates, which rest within the 0-0.1% range.\n\nBe that as it may, the yen\u2019s retreat sparked fresh intervention warnings, with Japan\u2019s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda saying that they are \u201cseriously concerned and on high alert\u201d. With that in mind, dollar/yen traders may liquidate some of their positions in fear of another round of intervention, thereby allowing the pair to pull back below 160 in the following days, even though the broader trend remains positive. Indeed, the pair is already pulling back today and a slowdown in tomorrow\u2019s US core PCE price index could extend the retreat.\n\nIs Wall Street Preparing for New Records?\n\nAll three of Wall Street\u2019s main indices ended Wednesday\u2019s session in the green, with the tech-heavy gaining the most. Although both the Nasdaq and the are still hovering below their record highs, it may be a matter of time before they surpass them.\n\nThe latest rebound in Nvidia's (NASDAQ: ) stock suggests that investors remain willing to continue pricing growth opportunities related to artificial intelligence (AI), while as far as US interest rates are concerned, delayed reductions by a couple of months may not be much of a concern for equity traders, as long as the expected direction remains the same.",

The is now flirting with the 172 level, while the USD/JPY is consolidating gains above the 160 level. The only thing that prevents the yen from a further fall is the direct intervention risk. But other than that, the yen deserves to lose more blood. One-year risk reversals, which show how traders feel about the yen over a longer time, hint that they're still kind of excited about the yen compared to the dollar. But that excitement is fading fast as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) keeps delaying its intervention plans meanwhile the Federal Reserve delays its rate-cutting plans. The BoJ is expected \u2013 is obliged \u2013 to give a clearer roadmap regarding how it will reduce its bond purchases in July meeting. They might also be obliged to hike rates given that the pressure on the yen won\u2019t ease until concrete steps are taken on the policy front. Everyone knows that a direct FX intervention will be nothing more than just another morphine injection: it won\u2019t give the yen more than a temporary relief.\n\nElsewhere, the euro remains under the pressure of French political shenanigans. The EUR/USD gets comfortable below the 1.07 level and the downside pressure will likely mount from now to the weekly close as many investors will probably chose to exit their long euro exposure before the first round of the legislative election that\u2019s due this weekend in France (and which will likely confirm the French preference for Marine Le Pen\u2019s party).

Cable cleared important technical supports yesterday as it slid below the 100 and 50-DMAs and below the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on April to June rally, meaning that the pair has now stepped into the medium-term bearish consolidation zone and is vulnerable to a further fall against the US dollar. The next support zone sits at 1.2560/80, the zone that shelters the 200-DMA and the 50% retracement. We could see the pound bears take aim at this range given that the general election in the UK is approaching. There is not much doubt about a Torie washout. This being said, there is a problem that the FT summarizes very well in just one sentence: Labour and the Conservatives are on course to register their lowest combined vote share in a century, according to pre-election polls. The latter could leave the country with a lot of political uncertainties moving forward.\n\nFar, far away from home, the is among rare major currencies that challenge the dollar\u2019s strength, after the Australian inflation hit 4% in May, leaving the RBA doves with no more energy to fly. But overall, the weakness in euro, pound and yen sent the to the highest levels since the beginning of May, and expect more inflows into the greenback before the French election weekend.\n\nOne thing that could derail the US dollar\u2019s positive trajectory this week is economic data. Due today, the US will reveal its latest GDP update, and tomorrow we will have a look at the core PCE \u2013 the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) favorite gauge of inflation. What the Fed doves want to see is reasonably softer economic growth combined with softening inflation. The risk is seeing a softening growth with an insufficient retreat in inflation. Good news is that the inflation component in the GDP report won\u2019t matter much as inflation has started to ease after an early uptick in Q1, so we won\u2019t have the full picture to speculate on new Fed scenarios before tomorrow\u2019s PCE release. In all cases, rising bets that the Fed could cut rates by 300bp in the next nine months is overdone unless a big, big problem emerges in the US economy.\n\nIn equities and bonds, the was slightly higher yesterday, the and rose to the highest levels in two weeks despite a good 5-year bond auction as the rising Japanese yields rose anxiety among bond investors, but not among stock buyers. The and closed slightly higher on Wednesday thanks to a late rally, as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) hit a record high following a 3.9% rally and reached the $2 trillion mark in terms of market cap for the very first time after announcing its plans to launch a Temu-like discount section that ships goods directly from China. Temu\u2019s owner PDD plunged below its 50-DMA on the news. Rivian (NASDAQ: ) rose 23% after Volkswagen (ETR: ) said it will invest $5bn to a joint venture to produce the next generation EVs with the struggling Rivian, while Micron (NASDAQ: ) fell 8% in late trading despite better-than-expected earnings and revenue, because the revenue forecast for the current quarter just met analyst expectations of $7.6bn for the current quarter. Yes, anything less than fantastic is not good enough when your share price got multiplied by three in just about 18 months. Finally, FedEx (NYSE: ) jumped 15% and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ) \u2013 the biggest European company that sells weight-loss drugs \u2013 hit a fresh record after announcing that it could finally got the approval from Chinese authorities to sell its drugs to the Chinese (who wouldn\u2019t need them if they stuck to their own delicious diet)",

        "body": "We\u2019re starting to see some real volatility developing in the markets and, while it\u2019s not necessarily showing up in the , it is occurring in three very important assets - NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), and lumber.\n\nInvestors are starting to learn about the downside of chasing returns and the hot stock of the moment. In just three trading days, NVIDIA lost 17% of its value, pushing a lot of recent entries into the red on their investment and perhaps questioning whether they want to stay in and try to ride this out. The stock\u2019s 3-day decline of 13% is its worst since late 2022 and daily share price swings have been getting larger compared to what we\u2019ve seen over much of the past year. Investors are starting to learn about the downside of chasing returns and the hot stock of the moment. In just three trading days, NVIDIA lost 17% of its value, pushing a lot of recent entries into the red on their investment and perhaps questioning whether they want to stay in and try to ride this out. The stock\u2019s 3-day decline of 13% is its worst since late 2022 and daily share price swings have been getting larger compared to what we\u2019ve seen over much of the past year.\n\nFor better or worse, NVIDIA has become the market for a lot of people. Everybody loves the stock when it goes up, but they find out how strong their stomach is on the way down. This is the first time since April where shareholders have gotten a real gut check and how well they handle it could determine the next leg of this market. I\u2019ve said repeatedly that NVIDIA has the potential to drag down the entire market right now. We could be in the midst of our first big test of that theory.\n\nhas been on a similar trajectory, dropping nearly 20% from peak to valley in the month of June. While volatility is the norm in crypto, when crypto and NVIDIA are both dropping sharply at the same time, it\u2019s a sign that investors aren\u2019t optimistic about growth and could be pivoting to defense quickly.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that Treasuries and utilities started rallying at the market close Monday at the expense of the and . I think it\u2019s too aggressive a move to be purely about the Fed and the direction of interest rates and more about a change in investor sentiment.\n\nThe 9% drop in prices last week is usually a direct reflection on economic optimism as well. With the housing market locked up due to high mortgage rates, housing starts slowing and home prices looking like they may be rolling over, one of the cornerstones of the U.S. economy looks like it\u2019s softening. This could be a short-term thing, but I don\u2019t like that all three of these assets are declining sharply at the same time.\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned here in recent weeks, consumer behavior and sentiment, I believe, are getting ready to turn. We\u2019ll get personal spending & income numbers later this week, but we keep getting more signs that the consumer is vulnerable. Management teams at both Walmart (NYSE: ) and Target Corporation (NYSE: ) have been warning of cautious outlooks due to high inflation & lower spending and the likelihood that they\u2019re going to need to offer deep discounts on merchandise in order to encourage sales.\n\nAlso, the U.S. Michigan current economic conditions index dropped from a 3-year high in March to its lowest reading since December 2022 in June. Those kinds of sharp declines in the data and warnings from retailers don\u2019t usually happen without a reason and I think we\u2019re very near the point where the consumer finally breaks.\n\nThe Japanese has been hovering around the 160 level for the past few days and I wonder if the market is kind of treating it as a de facto ceiling for the currency. The BoJ has intervened around these levels in the past and has stated repeatedly that it\u2019s standing ready to intervene again at any time. That being the case, I think some forex traders may be establishing positions in the yen here hoping that a BoJ intervention could result in a short-term pop.\n\nEither way, the yen is clearly still in a very weakened state and it\u2019s likely going to take some action from the central bank in order to keep it from free falling. We know that interventions haven\u2019t worked so far, which leaves rate hikes as the only viable option for strengthening the currency.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think there\u2019s a good chance the BoJ pulls the trigger this summer and begins the long process of trying to normalize policy conditions. Of course, that could also be the start of the reverse carry trade that unwinds a boatload of short yen positions and creates a global currency crisis. Asset managers are already at record short yen positions and any move by the BoJ to support the yen could create a snowball effect that spills over into the entire global risk asset market.\n\nThe Japanese banking sector looks like it\u2019s in trouble.",

        "title": "FedEx Earnings: PE Still Cheap to Growth, Freight Spinoff Adds to Valuation Story",
        "body": "FedEx (NYSE: ) reported their fiscal Q4 \u201924 Tuesday night, June 25th, 2024 after the closing bell, and the stock rose $39 or 15% yesterday, June 26th, on heavy volume as FedEx disclosed on page 2 of the earnings release that \u201cFedEx Freight has announced plans to further optimize its operations and match capacity with demand through planned permanent closure of 7 freight facilities\u2026FedEx management and the Board of Directors are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx Freight in the company\u2019s portfolio structure and potential steps to further unlock sustainable shareholder value.\u201d\n\nTo keep this summary short and sweet and digestable for clients and readers, here\u2019s a quick summary of the important points in the quarter.\n\nThe valuation story remains intact:\n\nHere\u2019s the next three years key metrics after revisions post earnings:\n\nFiscal \u201927 EPS estimate: $26.89, +13% expected growth\n\n$26.89, +13% expected growth Fiscal \u201926 EPS estimate: $23.86, +15% expected growth\n\n$23.86, +15% expected growth Fiscal \u201925 EPS estimate: $20.79, +17% expected growth\n\nFiscal \u201927 PE : 11x\n\n: 11x Fiscal \u201926 PE : 12x\n\n: 12x Fiscal \u201925 PE: 14x\n\nFiscal \u201927 revenue estimate: $99.2 billion, +6% expected growth\n\n$99.2 billion, +6% expected growth Fiscal \u201926 revenue estimate: $93.9 billion, +4% expected growth\n\n$93.9 billion, +4% expected growth Fiscal \u201925 revenue estimate: $89.97 billion, +3% expected growth\n\nEstimate source: LSEG.com (formerly IBES data by Refinitiv)\n\nEven with the 15% jump in stock price on Wednesday, June 26th, the PE remains quite reasonable to expected EPS growth (and I\u2019m not really a fan of the PEG ratio), and price to sales is still below 1.0x at 0.83x after Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nFree-cash-flow (FCF) has improved dramatically over the last 4 quarters, (trailing-twelve-months or TTM), rising 45% over the last 4 quarters, and 18% over the last 12 quarters.\n\nFCF spiked dramatically during Covid, peaking at $4.25 billion (TTM) in the May \u201921 quarter. It ended the May \u201924 fiscal year at $3.13 billion.\n\nFedEx still sports a 4% free-cash-flow yield after Wednesday\u2019s 15% increase in stock price.\n\nHere\u2019s a little simple math being done to get to peak EPS for FedEx:\n\nThe fiscal 2025 rev estimate is $90 billion times 9% operating margin = $8.1 billion times effective tax rate of 25% (1 \u2013 0.75), equals $6.075 billion divided by 248 million shares outstanding or $24.50 per share. (This is an estimate, not a prediction, and remember this is a full-year EPS estimate). The fiscal 2025 EPs estimate per the above data is currently $20.76, which didn\u2019t change much after FedEx\u2019s conservative guide for \u201925.\n\nThe FedEx management team is gunning for the 10% operating margin, but 9% was assumed for fiscal \u201925.\n\nIf FedEx stock trades up to $325, with a $24.50 EPS estimate, it\u2019s still trading at just 13x EPS. That assumes too just a small improvement in the operating margin and no additional shares repurchased.\n\nFedEx Freight:\n\nFedEx consolidated guided to $5.2 billion in capex for fiscal \u201925, which is exactly where fiscal \u201924 came in (i.e. $5.176 billion), but fiscal \u201924 was down 16% from fiscal \u201923. It\u2019s hard to say if the Freight facility closures are already in fiscal \u201925 capex, or perhaps they are not material.\n\nThe potential spinning off of Freight is another potential additional catalyst for FedEx stock. Morningstar\u2019s analyst Matt Young didn\u2019t address the Freight divestiture in his comments, only focus on current operations, but Jeffries Stephanie Moore, did say that FedEx Freight could be worth $30 billion, in a sale.\n\nFreight has consistently been 10% \u2013 11% of FedEx\u2019s total revenue but with much higher margins of late after management fixed the issues in the latter part of last decade.\n\nHere\u2019s this blogs internal spreadsheet on Freight\u2019s financial history: note the improvement in operating margin.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Freight can sustain the operating margin, it may not be a bad time to get rid of the segment.\n\nSummary / conclusion:\n\nLike the earnings preview title, which was right on target, I still think FedEx is too cheap but give it some time to consolidate the 15% jump in the stock price yesterday.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\u2019s is still sticking to the 10% operating margin target, but I suspect FedEx will eventually do better than that. Even if Freight is spunoff with it\u2019s 15% \u2013 20% operating margin, (much higher than Ground\u2019s 11% \u2013 12% and Express\u2019s 4% \u2013 5%), the economic logic or the financial logic here is that Freight\u2019s capital-intensity will be jettisoned too.\n\nThe expected revenue growth over the next 3 years has returned to positive growth, versus negative y-o-y declines.\n\nAs the performance chart on the earnings preview demonstrated, FedEx\u2019s stock price performance has lagged the SP 500 for 5 and 10 year time periods, but the stock has always delivered. Raj Subramaniam, and the FedEx management team have obviously been \u201cgreenlit\u201d by the Board and probably Fred Smith too (now Executive Chairman) to take measures to improve returns-on-capital and drive shareholder value (i.e. get the stock price moving) after the fundamentals of the Express business have changed over the years.\n\nLook for slightly higher revenue growth ( a mild recession shouldn\u2019t impact FedEx too greatly at this point), higher EPS on continued margin gains, higher free-cash-flow on lower capex and capital intensity, more capital returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, and a more focused and leaner FedEx going forward.\n\nA leaner and more profitable FedEx should result from the changes over the next year or so. I hope FedEx management finds other areas to improve the transport giant.",

All goods spending fell 1.9% in 1Q24, after rising 3% in 4Q23. PCE goods categories were strong in the holiday quarter. Post-holiday, consumers pulled back sharply amid the effects of multi-year inflation.\n\nOutside GDP, economic indicators generally suggest deceleration, although growth continues at a subdued level. April retail sales were unchanged from March, extending the weak PCE performance in first-quarter GDP. US factory orders rose 1.6% in April, while durable goods orders rose 0.7%. Industrial production dipped 0.3% in April, and capacity utilization of 78.4% was 1.2 points below its long-run (1972-2023) average.\n\nGiven the realities of the current environment, we lowered our forecast for 2024 GDP growth to 1.8%, from a prior 2%. Our expectations for 2025 GDP growth are in the 2% range.\n\nStill, five months into 2024, the market is showing impressive sector breadth. Unlike in 2023, the top growth-focused sectors are barely beating the market rather than trouncing it as they did a year earlier. Seven sectors are either tracking or beating the S&P 500.\n\nBeyond summer, investors are bracing for what could be the most partisan election in the modern era.

The following reflects our guidance for the calendar third quarter of 2024.\n\nAlthough we use a quantitative, six-part, \u201cblind\u201d sector model, our sector recommendations tend to align with qualitative and fundamental dynamics in the market outlook. We have raised the Energy sector to recommended Market-Weight from recommended Under-Weight. Energy demand appears to have stabilized, as initial consumer euphoria over EVs has cooled, and global economic recovery has put petroleum supply and demand into relative balance.\n\nOriginal Content",

This bullish momentum comes despite setbacks in the Robotaxi race and ongoing issues with the Cybertruck.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, in the fiercely competitive realm of autonomous driving, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) has surged ahead of Tesla in the Robotaxi race. Elon Musk's ambitious vision for Robotaxis, set to potentially catapult Tesla's stock beyond its previous $300 peak, faces formidable competition from Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary specializing in self-driving vehicles.\n\nAfter 15 years of research and a staggering $8 billion investment, Waymo has boldly launched its Waymo One Robotaxi service to all San Francisco residents as of June 25.\n\n\"With tens of thousands of weekly rides, our Waymo One service provides safe, sustainable, and reliable transportation for both residents and visitors to the city,\" announced the Google-controlled company on X.\n\nDespite lingering safety concerns, Alphabet undeniably leads Tesla in this groundbreaking innovation poised to transform the mobility landscape.\n\nCybertruck Problems Persist for Tesla\n\nHowever, Tesla's challenges persist. The Cybertruck, heralded as an \"unbreakable\" pickup truck inspired by Blade Runner, continues to encounter setbacks.\n\nInitially delayed due to regulatory issues, Tesla faced another setback in April when it recalled 4,000 units to address accelerator pedal issues. More recently, over 11,600 models were recalled for malfunctioning windshield wipers, with an additional 11,300 vehicles flagged for trunk floor installation problems.\n\nFalling Deliveries Pose Future Risks\n\nIn the second quarter, Tesla's deliveries fell short of expectations. Analysts at RBC Capital recently projected a 4.3% shortfall compared to the average forecast, marking a 2.5% decline from the previous quarter's figures in the United States.\n\nThe drop in deliveries poses a significant challenge for Tesla amidst ongoing issues with the Cybertruck and a competitive Robotaxi market. This setback could compel Tesla to consider further reductions in Model 3 prices to stimulate consumer demand.\n\nTesla's Fair Value and Target Price\n\nAccording to InvestingPro, Tesla's current stock price reflects a 2.8% decrease in fair value assessments. Analysts, on the other hand, anticipate a further decline, setting an average target price of $183.03 - 6.8% below the closing price of $196.40 on Wednesday, June 26.\n\n\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nMarket Demands More Innovations\n\nRBC Capital analysts highlight a surge in global demand for electric vehicles, underscoring Tesla's continued leadership despite heightened competition.\n\nHowever, the company's future success hinges on innovation beyond current offerings like the Cybertruck and Robotaxi. Investors, who have previously shown strong confidence in Tesla, now look to Elon Musk to unveil new groundbreaking initiatives that can restore the company's stature among Wall Street's elite.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, get exclusive discounts on our subscriptions, including annual plans for less than $7 a month!\n\nTired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is written for informational purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation, offer, advice, counsel or recommendation to invest as such it is not intended to incentivize the purchase of assets in any way.

        "body": "Tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet are hitting new highs, potentially driving a broader rally.\n\nQQQ, an ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100, is nearing overbought territory but the bullish trend remains intact.\n\nKey support and resistance levels are highlighted for Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Nvidia, and QQQ.\n\nUnlock AI-powered Stock Picks for Under $7/Month: Summer Sale Starts Now!\n\nUS index futures have been relatively flat following a mixed close yesterday, with a few tech giants reaching new all-time highs. Investors are largely on hold ahead of Friday\u2019s data release, so the recent consolidation in major indexes and certain market sectors isn't surprising.\n\nHowever, this trend could shift as Wall Street opens, with the tech sector potentially leading the charge again. Given the bullish price movements in stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), a tech-driven rally seems likely. The key to watch is Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), whose performance heavily influences major US indexes. Let's examine the charts of these four stocks and discuss , an ETF tracking the .\n\nCan AI Help Maximize Your Gains This Summer?\n\nThe answer is yes. Our cutting-edge AI analyzes mountains of data to pinpoint high-potential stocks before the market reacts.\n\nFor less than $7 a month during our summer sale, you'll receive a monthly update featuring our AI's curated selection of stocks primed for significant upside.\n\nStop missing out and subscribe to ProPicks today!\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Nvidia: The Tech Rally's Potential Drivers\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Nvidia are pivotal tech stocks to monitor. At least three of these have shown bullish trends this week, potentially sustaining the tech rally and supporting the Nasdaq 100, and by extension, QQQ.\n\nSo here are the four trading opportunities on offer if tech leads the charge higher today:\n\n1. Amazon Breaks Out After Bullish Consolidation\n\nAmazon surged past resistance in the $190 - $191 range on Wednesday, closing up 3.9% at a record high and becoming the fifth member of the \"Magnificent 7\" to reach a $2 trillion market cap. This breakout is a strong bullish indicator, which could sustain the tech rally even if Nvidia pauses.\n\nThe $190-$191 area now serves as key support; it must hold to maintain bullish sentiment, with $185.33 (Monday\u2019s low) as a critical level. A drop below this could invalidate the breakout, potentially leading to a sell-off. If support holds, Amazon could target $195 initially and $200 subsequently.\n\n2. Alphabet Hits Another All-Time High\n\nAlphabet has consistently reached new all-time highs, breaking out of a bullish consolidation pattern this week and surpassing the $180 resistance level. It has since exceeded the recent high around $182, making this a critical support level. Ideally, the stock should stay above this breakout area, but falling below it isn't disastrous unless it drops past the recent low around $175.62, which would undermine the bullish breakout.\n\n3. Tesla Continues Its Recovery\n\nTesla\u2019s long-term chart shows a bearish trend since November 2021, with several lower highs. However, short-term action since late April has been bullish. The stock broke past the $180 resistance and has hovered around this psychological level for weeks.\n\nThis week, Tesla moved higher, surpassing short-term resistance at $188, now the crucial support level. On the upside, $200 is the next hurdle, with minimal resistance until the bearish trend line around $220, depending on the price movement. The recent low at $176.92 is critical; a break below it would negate this week's bullish trend and potentially deter investors.\n\n4. Nvidia Shows Signs of Stabilization\n\nNvidia, a key stock for the tech sector, has been volatile recently, falling from its record high of $140.76 last Thursday. Currently, it seems to have found support around $118, holding above the 21-day exponential moving average. The break above Monday\u2019s high of $124.46 must hold on a daily closing basis to sustain bullish momentum. The critical support level is $118. In terms of resistance, $130 is the key level to watch, having served as support before last week's breakdown.\n\nQQQ Chart Remains Constructive\n\nThe chart of QQQ, an ETF which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100, remains constructive for now. But the RSI is still near the overbought levels of 70, which may need to be addressed before we potentially see the next big upward move.\n\nSince the end of May, QQQ has rallied almost 10% from its lowest point of 443.06 to its most recent high so far of 486.86. It has made more than 17% when you use its lowest point made in April at 413.07. As a result of this sharp rally, the index has reached extreme overbought technically levels.\n\nFor example, the relative strength index (RSI) has now climbed well above the 70.0 threshold to reach north of 80.0. With the market being this overbought, it is becoming increasingly uncomfortable for traders to justify continued buying into mini, intraday, dips.\n\nThe RSI needs to work off its overbought conditions, at least through time (i.e., consolidation) if not price action (i.e., at least a mini sell-off). For this bullish trend to remain intact, you obviously don't want to see too much technical damage. But a bit of a pullback should be a welcome sign, even from a bullish point of view, as this will remove some froth from the market.\n\nLast week saw QQQ reach 485.61, the 200% extension level of the last downswing that took place between March and April. With the RSI being above 70 at that point, the subsequent drop is understandable. The RSI is now a little less overbought, but it remains near 70.\n\nIf the bullish trend continues, then that 485.61 level would remain the first objective. Meanwhile, the 261.8% Fibonacci extension of the same swing comes in at 508. In between those extension levels, you have the psychologically-important 500 level, which also needs to be watched closely, should we get there.\n\nIn terms of support levels to watch, the first line of defence for the bulls is at 473/474 area, which was tested and held earlier this week. Below that, 468.14 is the next level down, where we have seen a breakaway gap. The latter also comes in close proximity to the 21-day exponential moving average. A more significant support zone is seen at around 449, which corresponds with the high from May.\n\nThe bulls would be happy they have now seen a bit of a pullback and consolidation. However, if we instead see a full-on sell off that potentially takes out the most recent low at 443.06, then that would be a bearish development, for then we will have created our first lower low. In that case, we could then see some follow up technical selling towards the 200 moving average and long-term support at around 412, which was also the high from last year.\n\nHowever, we will cross that bridge if and when we get there. For now, the bullish trend remains intact.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, get exclusive discounts on our subscriptions, including annual plans for less than $7 a month!\n\nTired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!\n\nDisclaimer: This article is written for informational purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation, offer, advice, counsel or recommendation to invest as such it is not intended to incentivize the purchase of assets in any way.

        "title": "Micron Post-Earnings Selloff Highlights Risks That Come With Sky-High AI Hopes",
        "body": "Micron shares plunged in after-hours trading following earnings.\n\nHas the stock been unfairly punished?\n\nWe will assess that and also consider if the market's overreaction was justified.\n\nUnlock AI-powered stock picks for under $7/month: Summer sale is live!\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: ) shares took a nosedive in after-hours trading on Wednesday, plunging more than 6.5% following the release of its .\n\nJust last week, Micron hit an all-time high of $157.5, but the stock has since experienced a steep correction. This pullback is likely profit-taking as the stock has already rallied 66% YTD.\n\nIf the after-hours slide translates to Thursday's regular trading session, Micron could see a total decline of almost 10% from its record high. This decline underscores the volatility in the chip market.\n\nMicron's Earnings Beat Met With a Selloff\n\nMicron's latest earnings report offered a mixed bag for investors. While the company surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, its forecast fell short, leading to a sharp decline in stock price.\n\nMicron reported EPS of $0.62, exceeding the anticipated $0.51. Similarly, sales reached $6.81 billion, surpassing the projected $6.67 billion. However, the company's forward guidance for the current quarter proved to be the source of investor discontent.\n\nThe disappointment stems from Micron's forecast for the current quarter: an EPS of $1.08 on sales of $7.6 billion, aligning precisely with analysts' expectations of $1.05 EPS on $7.6 billion in sales.\n\nInvestors punished the stock not for missing expectations, but for merely meeting them. This reaction might seem excessive at first glance, but it reflects the high valuation already priced into Micron's stock.\n\nMicron\u2019s share price had surged over 65% since the beginning of the year, fueled by the booming demand for AI technology, including the memory used in Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s AI graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nHowever, the recent forecasts have led to a reassessment of the stock's value. Despite the drop from last week's record high, valuation models suggest Micron is still overvalued.\n\nAccording to InvestingPro Fair Value, which aggregates several respected financial models, Micron's fair value is $97.84\u2014over 31% below its closing price on Wednesday.\n\nThis significant discrepancy underscores why investors reacted so strongly to the company's latest forecast.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nHowever, analysts are more optimistic, with an average target of $153.08, which translates into a potential upside of 7.5%.\n\nMicron Remains a Good Bet, but Now May Not Be the Best Time to Buy\n\nMicron's stock correction might worsen after today's decline, even though the company remains highly relevant to the AI rally. Micron manufactures the large quantities of memory essential for the computer systems that create, train, and operate powerful AI tools.\n\nChip prices continue to rise due to surging demand and shortages driven by the AI and tech booms. This situation exemplifies the difficulty in picking the best stocks: Micron is a strong company poised for growth as the AI industry expands. However, the current euphoria has pushed its share price beyond what fundamentals justify.\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving market, where diverse factors influence trends, it's increasingly challenging for the average investor to determine which stocks to buy and when. Micron stands as a textbook case of a good stock at the wrong time, reflecting the eternal investor dilemma.\n\nHow AI Helps Investors Cope with Market Changes\n\nAs market dynamics become increasingly complex, more investors are turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to spot the best opportunities. AI can analyze vast amounts of financial and other data, correlating them with stock price trends to create predictive models that identify high-potential stocks before they surge. Machine learning allows these models to continually improve and adapt.\n\nInvestingPro's AI-driven ProPicks applies these principles through six thematic portfolios, re-evaluated monthly and available to all InvestingPro subscribers. These portfolios are a testament to the efficacy of AI in investment strategy.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nAnd the least we can say is that this method has paid off.

        "title": "Microsoft Was Just Named a $600 Stock with a 33% Upside",
        "body": "Microsoft shares have been enjoying a solid rally this year.\n\nEven with them at a fresh high this week, there are reasons to think there\u2019s a ton more upside.\n\nAnalysts are calling for additional gains of as much as 30% from current levels.\n\nWith its stock closing at another record high last night, around $450, it\u2019s safe to say that Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is having a great year so far. The tech titan is up more than 20% in 2024, with many gains coming in the past two months alone.\n\nFor context, the benchmark S&P 500 index has only managed to tack on 16% over the same timeframe, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) has done even less. Indeed, when it comes to finding another $1 trillion-plus market cap tech company that\u2019s outperformed Microsoft, you need to go to the likes of NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), with its 140% gain this year, or Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) with its 40% gain.\n\nBullish Market: AI-Driven Gains and Hopes for Rate Cuts\n\nBroadly speaking, this year has seen a strong risk-on sentiment sweep across equities, with artificial intelligence (AI)- related stocks doing particularly well. In addition, inflation readings continue to trend down, and the market is licking its licks at the thought of an interest rate cut.\n\nThat said, some valuation concerns are being raised about how lopsided this rally is, with NVIDIA and Meta alone accounting for much of the entire S&P 500\u2019s gains. However, the good news for Microsoft investors is that the market expects the stock to continue rallying.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Market Position: Analysts Predict Strong Upside\n\nThis was the sentiment of the team at Citi last week when they reiterated their Buy rating on the stock and upped their price target. Their bullish outlook is based on continuing positive news around the generative AI leader, OpenAI, in which Microsoft owns a significant stake. Recent reports have suggested that OpenAI\u2019s revenue has more than doubled yearly to $3.4 billion. Citi analyst Tyler Tadke was also bullish on Microsoft\u2019s internal revenue engine, with solid strength in its cloud computing platform, Azure, a key factor.\n\nHaving previously had a price target of $495 on Microsoft shares, Tadke has upped this to $520. This points to an additional upside of around 15%, pushing the stock further into blue-sky territory. But that\u2019s not even the most bullish price target that\u2019s recently been printed.\n\nTake Tigress Financial, for example, who earlier this month put a price target of $550 on Microsoft shares, or New Street Research, which went straight to $570 when they initiated coverage with a Buy rating. For both of these teams and, indeed, almost all the analysts who\u2019ve rated Microsoft bullishly this year, it\u2019s all about AI. The company seems to have done a great job in positioning itself to capture large pieces of the market, and there\u2019s every reason to think this leadership position will continue.\n\nHigh Expectations: Microsoft\u2019s Stock Poised for Continued Gains\n\nThis was also the sentiment from Truist Financial (NYSE: ), which reiterated its Buy rating on the stock just last week. What was particularly noteworthy here, though, was the $600 price target they gave Microsoft, which immediately became the new street high. This points to a massive 33% upside from where the stock closed on Tuesday.\n\nFor those of us on the sidelines who\u2019ve missed out on the gains so far this year but who\u2019ve been eager to get involved, this could be the buy signal we\u2019ve been waiting for. It\u2019s never easy buying into a stock that\u2019s already at all-time highs, but with the sheer volume of analysts screaming for more gains, you can\u2019t help but feel that Microsoft shares have a lot more in them.\n\nLook for the stock to continue rallying towards the $500 mark, with its next earnings report, due around the end of July, a key event on the calendar. Since this rally kicked off in early 2023, Microsoft has been doing everything right, and all the signs suggest this isn\u2019t going to change anytime soon.\n\nOriginal Post",
        "summary": "Microsoft shares have been enjoying a solid rally this year.\nWith its stock closing at another record high last night, around $450, it\u2019s safe to say that Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is having a great year so far.\nHaving previously had a price target of $495 on Microsoft shares, Tadke has upped this to $520.\nBut that\u2019s not even the most bullish price target that\u2019s recently been printed.\nWhat was particularly noteworthy here, though, was the $600 price target they gave Microsoft, which immediately became the new street high.",

Good yes, but nowhere near the 30% leap of team tech, or the frankly eye-popping 150% gain of chip champ Nvidia.\n\n\"Thirty percent of the S&P's returns this year have come from Nvidia alone,\" the chief investment officer of IBOSS Asset Management Chris Metcalfe said, pointing out it was now the most expensive stock on the most expensive market in the world.\n\nIt is not just equity markets where milestones have been set.\n\nJapan's yen has bowed to a 38-year low against the dollar in currency markets. Cocoa had one of its best-ever runs while French bond risk has exploded to its highest level since the euro crisis after French President Emmanuel Macron's drubbing by the far right in EU elections this month drove him to call a snap parliamentary election on Sunday.\n\nGovernment bonds had been having a tough time anyway. Predictions of a gush of rate cuts have turned out to be just a dribble in a few parts of Europe and emerging markets and certainly not in the United States yet.\n\nAs a result, anyone owning a basket of benchmark bonds has lost around 1.5% of their money.\n\n\"At the end of last year, the markets expected seven (U.S.) rate cuts and now they are expecting just one or two,\" Nadege Dufosse, the head of multi-asset at Candriam said. \"That has been the big driver and explains the (poor) performance.\"\n\nA shaky performance from U.S. President Joe Biden in his latest TV debate against Donald Trump has just ratcheted November's U.S. election uncertainty up substantially.\n\nThere's also a general election in Britain on July 4 although there aren't expected to be many market fireworks despite it being almost certainly the first change of government in 14 years.\n\nPolar Capital fund manager Georgina Hamilton explained that was because unlike in France and the U.S., the two main candidates to lead the UK are fairly centrist.\n\n\"Having had quite a lot of turmoil in recent years ... you can't underestimate that calmer political backdrop,\" she added.\n\nGOLD SHINES\n\nThe big story in commodities has been cocoa sky-rocketing almost 85% due to shortages which is already its second-biggest annual leap of all time, although certainly is not good news for chocoholics.\n\nGold hit a record high of just shy of $2,450 an ounce last month. Oil is up a respectable 12% while bitcoin broke though $70,000 and set a flurry of new highs after U.S. watchdogs gave bitcoin exchange-traded funds the green light.\n\nThe value of global M&A activity is up 5% compared to last year.\n\nThat's mainly down to a brace of $35-billion deals that saw credit-card firm Capital One take over Discover Financial and chip designer Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) buy out rival Ansys (NASDAQ: ), although it could have been much more though if BHP's gripping $49-billion pursuit of Anglo American (JO: ) had succeeded.\n\nDISTRESSED TO IMPRESS\n\nOff the beaten track, Ecuador's bonds have made 46% despite lingering debt concerns and Argentina's new chainsaw-wielding President Javier Milei has helped its bonds jump 32%.\n\nEmerging-market veteran Kevin Daly at Aberdeen said there has been a \"distressed to impress\" move, with the bonds of crashed countries like Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka all rallying between 16%-23% as their years-long debt restructurings have neared an end.\n\nAs always though, there has still been plenty of downs in emerging markets.\n\nChinese property stocks have fallen for the ninth quarter in a row. Devaluations have shoved Nigeria's and Egypt's currencies down 42% and 36% respectively, while Mexico's peso is down nearly 8% this month after a resounding presidential election result fed worries about its future path.",

        "body": "By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) -The women's wing of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party on Friday urged the National Commission for Women to launch an investigation after Reuters reported that Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn rejects married women from iPhone assembly jobs in the country.\n\n\"It is imperative to conduct a thorough investigation into these claims and ensure that the rights of women employees at Foxconn Hon Hai are protected,\" Vanathi Srinivasan, national president of Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) women's wing wrote in a letter to the Commission, posted on X.\n\nIn response to the letter, chairperson of the National Commission for Women, Rekha Sharma, wrote on X: \"we are doing the needful.\" She did not elaborate.\n\nThe National Commission for Women has the powers to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for women under the Constitution and other laws, its website says. It also has powers of a civil court to summon any person.\n\nApple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Reuters investigation published on Tuesday found that Foxconn has systematically excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant near Chennai in Tamil Nadu state, on the grounds they have more family responsibilities than their unmarried counterparts.\n\nFoxconn hiring agents and HR sources interviewed by Reuters cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons why Foxconn did not hire married women at the plant.\n\nThe story has sparked debates on TV channels and newspaper editorials.\n\nIn the letter, Srinivasan referred to the reported hiring practices of Foxconn as a \"grave issue\".\n\n\"It has come to our notice through various media sources that Foxconn has adopted discriminatory practices against married women,\" Srinivasan wrote.\n\nThe letter also stated that it had come to the knowledge of the BJP's women wing that women employees at Foxconn are not even allowed to use the washroom during working hours, and those who stay in hostels are not permitted to take leaves. Srinivasan's letter did not elaborate on these points.\n\nEarlier this week, Modi's labour ministry said it has requested a detailed report from the Labour Department of Tamil Nadu on the matter.\n\nIn response to questions from Reuters for its Tuesday report, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and said they had worked to address the issues. All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Sriperumbudur plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024. The two companies didn\u2019t address the 2023 and 2024 incidents.\n\nApple said that \"when concerns about hiring practices were first raised in 2022 we immediately took action and worked with our supplier to conduct monthly audits to identify issues and ensure that our high standards are upheld,\" adding that all its suppliers, including Foxconn, hire married women.\n\nFoxconn said it \"vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form.\"\n\nThe hiring curbs at the iPhone plant show the challenge for both Apple and Foxconn in upholding their stated global standards of inclusion while expanding their supply chains in this fast-growing but largely conservative country.\n\nModi has previously called for removal of societal impediments that prevent many Indian women from getting jobs. While Foxconn employs thousands of women in India, discrimination on the basis of marital status risks undercutting the prime minister's aims.\n\n(For full story on Reuters.com, please click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/foxconn-apple-india-women/)",

The IMF said a downside scenario would require $141 billion in external financing.\n\nNeither estimate includes the potential proceeds from a $50 billion loan that the G7 industrial democracies have agreed to grant Ukraine, backed by the earnings from frozen Russian assets, said Gavin Gray, the IMF's Ukraine mission chief.\n\nGray told reporters that the IMF would reassess Ukraine's financing framework should the loan be completed, but it was important that the use of Russian assets has \"sufficient legal underpinnings\" and does not undermine the functioning of the global financial system.\n\n\"Above all, continued support from all external partners is essential for Ukraine to sustain the progress on growth and stability, which has been achieved over the past year,\" Gray said. \"Without these resources, the hard-won macro-stabilization gains could be jeopardized.\"\n\nGray said that he did not expect the weaker economic outlook to have a material impact on Ukraine's negotiations with bondholders to restructure its debt, which are based on a medium-term framework that remains largely unchanged.

It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of latest alleged antitrust breaches.\n\nThe Commission said action Microsoft had taken did not sufficiently address its concerns and that more changes were necessary to restore competition.\n\nThe EU enforcer wants the company to sell Office without Teams at a lower price than what it has announced, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, while rivals want clearer interoperability terms and more incentives for users to switch to them.\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith reiterated comments made earlier this month about the company's willingness to resolve the issue.\n\n\"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission's remaining concerns,\" Smith said.\n\nSalesforce President and Chief Legal Officer Sabastian Niles urged the Commission to move towards a swift, binding and effective remedy to restore a free and fair choice.\n\nGerman rival and complainant Alfaview also welcomed the Commission's charge against Microsoft.\n\nTeams was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free and it subsequently replaced Skype for Business. Its popularity soared during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing but rivals said bundling the products together gave Microsoft an unfair advantage.\n\nMicrosoft in April separated Teams from Office globally to try to resolve EU antitrust concerns and also made it easier for rivals to function with its products but sources said the unbundling was unlikely to appease regulators.\n\n($1 = 0.9321 euros)",

        "title": "US has sent Israel thousands of 2,000-pound bombs since Oct. 7 By Reuters",
        "body": "By Humeyra Pamuk and Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration has sent to Israel large numbers of munitions, including more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles, since the start of the war in Gaza, said two U.S. officials briefed on an updated list of weapons shipments.\n\nBetween the war's start last October and recent days, the United States has transferred at least 14,000 of the MK-84 2,000-pound bombs, 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nWhile the officials didn't give a timeline for the shipments, the totals suggest there has been no significant drop-off in U.S. military support for its ally, despite international calls to limit weapons supplies and a recent administration decision to pause a shipment of powerful bombs.\n\nExperts said the contents of the shipments appear consistent with what Israel would need to replenish supplies used in this eight-month intense military campaign in Gaza, which it launched after the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants who killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\n\n\"While these numbers could be expended relatively quickly in a major conflict, this list clearly reflects a substantial level of support from the United States for our Israeli allies,\" said Tom Karako, a weapons expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that the listed munitions were the type Israel would use in its fight against Hamas or in a potential conflict with Hezbollah.\n\nThe delivery numbers, which have not been previously reported, provide the most up-to-date and extensive tally of munitions shipped to Israel since the Gaza war began.\n\nIsrael and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been trading fire since the start of the Gaza war, and concern is rising that an all-out war could break out between the two sides.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Israel's Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe shipments are part of a bigger list of weapons sent to Israel since the Gaza conflict began, one of the U.S. officials said. A senior Biden administration official on Wednesday told reporters that Washington has since Oct. 7 sent $6.5 billion worth of security assistance to Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent weeks claimed that Washington was withholding weapons, a suggestion U.S. officials have repeatedly denied even though they acknowledged some \"bottlenecks\".\n\nThe Biden administration has paused one shipment of the 2,000-pound bomb, citing concern over the impact it could have in densely populated areas in Gaza, but U.S. officials insist that all other arms deliveries continue as normal. One 2,000-pound bomb can rip through thick concrete and metal, creating a wide blast radius.\n\nReuters reported on Thursday that the United States is discussing with Israel the release of a shipment of large bombs that was suspended in May over worries about the military operation in Rafah.\n\nInternational scrutiny of Israel's military operation in Gaza has intensified as the Palestinian death toll from the war has exceeded 37,000, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the coastal enclave in ruins.\n\nWashington gives $3.8 billion in annual military assistance to its longtime ally. While Biden has warned that he would place conditions on military aid if Israel fails to protect civilians and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, he has not done so beyond delaying the May shipment.\n\nBiden's support for Israel in its war against Hamas has emerged as a political liability, particularly among young Democrats, as he runs for re-election this year. It fueled a wave of \"uncommitted\" protest votes in primaries and has driven pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. universities.\n\nWhile the United States provides detailed descriptions and quantities of military aid sent to Ukraine as it fights a full-scale invasion of Russia, the administration has revealed few details about the full extent of U.S. weapons and munitions sent to Israel.\n\nThe shipments are also hard to track because some of the weapons are shipped as part of arms sales approved by Congress years ago but only now being fulfilled.\n\nOne of the U.S. officials said the Pentagon has sufficient quantities of weapons in its own stocks and had been liaising with U.S. industry partners who make the weapons, such as Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and General Dynamics (NYSE: ), as the companies work to manufacture more.\n\n(This story has been corrected to fix the reference to $6.5 billion worth of US 'security assistance' to Israel instead of 'weapons' in paragraph 9)",

        "title": "US Treasury finalizes new crypto tax reporting rules By Reuters",
        "body": "By Hannah Lang\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department finalized a rule on Friday requiring cryptocurrency brokers, including exchanges and payment processors, to report new information on users' sales and exchanges of digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe new requirements aim to crack down on crypto users who may be failing to pay their taxes, and stem from the $1 trillion bipartisan 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. At the time the bill was passed, it was estimated that the new rules could bring in close to $28 billion over a decade.\n\nThe rule, which would be phased in starting next year for the 2026 tax filing season, align the tax requirements for cryptocurrencies with existing tax reporting requirements for brokers for other financial instruments, such as bonds and stocks, Treasury said.\n\nThe final rule was modified from Treasury's original proposal in order to limit some burdens on brokers and to phase in the new requirements in stages, Treasury officials said. It also includes a $10,000 threshold for reporting on transactions involving stablecoins, a type of crypto token typically pegged to an asset like the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry had waged a comment letter campaign after Treasury proposed the rule last year, arguing that the scope of the proposal's definition of a broker was too broad and that the requirements violated the privacy of crypto owners.\n\nTreasury said it reviewed more than 44,000 comments on the proposal. It also said it anticipates issuing additional rules later this year to establish tax reporting requirements for non-custodial brokers, including decentralized crypto exchanges.\n\nIn a release, Treasury emphasized that crypto owners \"have always owed tax on the sale or exchange of digital assets\" and that the new rule \"simply created reporting requirements... to help taxpayers file accurate returns and pay taxes owed under current law.\"\n\nThe rule introduces a new tax reporting form called Form 1099-DA, meant to help taxpayers determine if they owe taxes, and would help crypto users avoid having to make complicated calculations to determine their gains, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nBrokers would need to send the forms to both the IRS and digital asset holders to assist with their tax preparation.\n\nThe IRS currently requires crypto users to report many digital asset activities on their tax returns, regardless of whether the transactions resulted in a gain. Users are required to make that calculation themselves, and the platforms on which digital assets trade do not give the IRS that information.",

        "body": "By David Lawder\n\n(Reuters) - The United States and India have extended a standstill agreement on U.S. retaliation over India's digital-services tax until Sunday, aligning it with a fast-approaching deadline for a global deal to reallocate taxing rights on the world's biggest and most profitable companies, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday.\n\nIn a brief announcement, the Treasury said that a November 2021 political compromise that expired March 31 would be extended through the end of the month, as negotiations on the \"Pillar 1\" tax agreement continue.\n\nThe Pillar 1 deal is in danger of collapse, as the U.S., India and China have failed to agree on key elements of the deal related to calculation of transfer pricing to help determine local tax liabilities.\n\nThe stakes of the last-minute negotiations are high. The deal's failure could prompt several countries to reinstate their taxes on U.S. tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and risk punitive duties on billions of dollars in exports to the U.S.\n\nThe extension of the U.S.-India agreement also aligns it with the expiration of similar deals with six other countries that had enacted digital-services taxes: Austria, Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Turkey.\n\nThese countries suspended their digital-services taxes shortly after a two-pillar tax deal was struck in October 2021 by nearly 140 countries to impose a 15% global minimum corporate income tax and complete negotiation on reallocating some taxing rights on large multinationals to countries where they sell goods and services. This was meant to replace the digital-services taxes.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Trade Representative's office agreed to suspend planned trade retaliation against the digital taxes while negotiations were completed.\n\nU.S. negotiations are being led by the Treasury, where a spokesperson declined to comment on the state of negotiations.\n\nA USTR spokesperson also declined to comment on next steps, but added: \"As we\u2019ve said previously, we oppose digital-services taxes that unfairly target U.S. companies and the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework negotiations offer the best path to address the challenges that digitalization of the economy poses to the international tax system.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters at a G7 finance meeting in May that India and China were hindering agreement on the alternative transfer-pricing mechanism known as \"Amount B,\" but that talks were continuing.\n\nItaly's finance minister also blamed the U.S. demands for the inability to agree on terms. Italy is seeking an extension of the U.S. standstill agreement and sources told Reuters earlier on Friday that Italy has asked Google to pay $1 billion in unpaid taxes.",

Its board also authorized $30 billion in new share buybacks, effective July 1.\n\nBank of America's dividend will rise to 26 cents a share from 24 cents, and Citigroup's will increase to 56 cents from 53 cents, the lenders said in separate regulatory filings.\n\n\"Banks are going to remain conservative on capital as uncertainty over the Basel proposal remains,\" Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said after the dividends were announced.\n\nBanks have argued that higher capital requirements proposed under draft rules known as the Basel endgame could impede their ability to lend and could be detrimental for the economy.\n\nMorgan Stanley boosted its dividend to 92.5 cents a share from 85 cents, according to a filing.\n\nThe announcements came after the banks cleared the Fed's stress test earlier this week, which determines how much capital they need to set aside before they can return money to shareholders.\n\nGoldman Sachs' dividend will climb to $3 per share, compared with $2.75 earlier.\n\nHow well a bank performs on the stress tests dictates the size of its stress capital buffer (SCB) - an extra cushion of capital the Fed requires banks to hold to weather a hypothetical economic downturn.\n\nGoldman said it will engage with its regulator to better understand why its SCB jumped.\n\n\"This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we\u2019ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity,\" CEO David Solomon said in a statement.\n\nWells Fargo's dividend will rise to 40 cents.\n\nThis year, 31 big banks were tested, compared with 23 last year. The checks showed banks would have enough capital to continue lending in several scenarios, including a major spike in unemployment, severe market volatility, and plunges in residential and commercial mortgage markets.\n\nBank New dividend Old Dividend\n\n(per share) (per share)\n\nJPMorgan $1.25 $1.15\n\nBank of America 26 cents 24 cents\n\nCitigroup 56 cents 53 cents\n\nWells Fargo 40 cents 35 cents\n\nGoldman Sachs $3 $2.75\n\nMorgan Stanley 92.5 cents 85 cents",

        "body": "By Brendan O'Boyle and Daniel Ramos\n\nLA PAZ (Reuters) - A coup attempt in Bolivia that saw soldiers take over La Paz's central square and ram the presidential palace with an armored truck was put down as abruptly as it started, but has laid bare a brewing economic and political crisis in the divided nation.\n\nOn Wednesday, military units led by rogue General Juan Jose Zuniga launched the attack on the government, but pulled back as it quickly became clear they had little support. The former armed forces commander was arrested on live TV.\n\nBut while the government of leftist President Luis Arce heralded its success at putting down the coup attempt, it has uncovered the tense political fault lines in the South American country and growing anger with a flagging economy.\n\n\"We have a president with low popularity, without legislative control, with economic problems,\" said Raul Penaranda, a Bolivian political analyst and journalist. \"All of this makes for a very difficult and complicated scenario.\"\n\nThe country of some 12 million people is heading for presidential elections next year. Arce's socialist MAS party is split between backing him and party grandee and icon Evo Morales, a former ally to Arce who is now trying to unseat him.\n\nMeanwhile the economy is floundering.\n\nGas exports that helped drive the country's \"economic miracle\" in the 2000s have dried up, leading to a dangerous decline in foreign reserves that are near zero. Protests have been building, with many people unable to get dollars, and pressure on the long-stable currency is rising.\n\nIn the heat of the failed coup, flanked by soldiers, Zuniga cited growing frustrations, demanding the government \"stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country.\"\n\nOn all sides of the aisle, Bolivians though rejected the coup attempt, which many saw with dark humor as a something of a farce. Zuniga himself, without giving evidence, had claimed Arce had asked him to do it to help boost his low approval ratings.\n\n\"Our beloved Bolivia is in economic crisis, it is in political crisis, it is in social crisis,\" La Paz resident Juan Carlos Llanque told Reuters outside the presidential palace in La Paz after the coup attempt. He still though backed Arce.\n\n\"This was all a political comedy.\"\n\nINSTABILITY HERE TO STAY\n\nSome analysts said Arce's image of facing down the attempted coup could even play in his favor ahead of the 2025 ballot, adding some harder edge to the bespectacled and generally low-profile former economy minister.\n\nYola Mamani from nearby El Alto, had come to support Arce in the central square, and said that he needed to be allowed to rule and be given space even by Morales.\n\n\"We see that you support humble people, vulnerable people who are going through very difficult times, so you can count on our support,\" she told Reuters, referring to Arce. \"We will give our lives for you if we have to.\"\n\nArce was elected in 2020 in a re-run of a disputed election a year earlier that ended with Morales fleeing the country amid violent protests. The iconic leftist leader who had been the country's first president from its majority indigenous community, returned from exile a year later after the election of Arce.\n\nThe two leaders, who oversaw a period of commodities-fueled prosperity for over a decade, have since become political rivals, each commanding a faction of supporters within the dominant but fractured Movement to Socialism party.\n\nMorales' controversial bid for an unprecedented fourth term in office in 2019 defied constitutional term limits and ended in the voided election and a months-long crisis.\n\nZuniga, the general, had waded into the political drama earlier this week, saying in an interview that Morales should not be able to return as president and threatening to block him if he attempted to, leading Arce to strip him of his command.\n\nEmerging markets investment firm Tellimer said in a report that the coup attempt - which it called a \"damp squib\" - had highlighted the fragile state of the country, with sky-high social tensions, ahead of elections next year.\n\nThe political tensions and pressures on foreign reserves have hit the country's risk index and bonds, leading to spreads being at their widest in years. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded Bolivia's debt to \"junk\" status.\n\n\"While the attempted coup has been put down, it is another negative event that points to weak institutions and political polarization,\" Tellimer wrote. \"The saga suggests the country's political instability is unlikely to improve any time soon.\"",

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n13 hours ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at \u00a35. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. \u201cThrough the launch of our repair service, we\u2019re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London\u2019s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "body": "Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases\n\n19 hours ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.\n\nHow do you treat E. coli and what are the symptoms?",

        "body": "Are rainy days ahead for cloud computing?\n\n1 day ago By Sean McManus , Technology reporter Share\n\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson David Heinemeier Hansson saved his firm serious money by leaving the cloud\n\nThis year, software firm 37signals will see a profit boost of more than $1m (\u00a3790,000) from leaving the cloud. \u201cTo be able to get that with such relatively modest changes to our business is astounding,\u201d says co-owner and chief technology officer, David Heinemeier Hansson. The US company has millions of users for its online project management and productivity software, including Basecamp and Hey. Like many companies it outsourced data storage and computing to a third party firm, a so-called cloud services provider. They own huge data centres, where they host data from other firms, which can be accessed over the internet. In 2022, such services cost 37signals $3.2m. \u201cSeeing the bill on a weekly basis really radicalised me,\u201d Mr Heinemeier Hansson says. \"I went: \u2018Wait! What are we spending for a week of rentals?\u2019 I could buy some really powerful computers just on one week\u2019s worth of [cloud] spending.\u201d So, he did. Buying hardware and hosting it in a shared data centre costs $840,000 per year. Although costs pushed Mr Heinemeier Hansson to act, other factors were also a concern. The internet is engineered to be highly resilient. \u201cI saw the distributed design erode as more and more companies gravitated essentially to three owners of computers,\u201d he says, referring to the three leading cloud providers. If a major data centre goes down, large parts of the web can go offline. The cloud was pitched, he says, as cheaper, easier, and faster. \u201cThe cloud was not able to make things easier to a point where we could measure any productivity gains,\u201d he says, noting his operations team has always been about the same size.\n\nWas using the cloud faster? \u201cYes, but it didn\u2019t matter,\" says Mr Heinemeier Hansson. \"If you want to connect a hundred servers to the internet, you can do it in less than five minutes [in the cloud]. That\u2019s incredible. \"But we do not need, nor do I believe the vast majority of companies need, a five-minute turnaround on a massive number of additional servers.\u201d He can have new servers delivered and racked in his data centre in a week, which is fast enough. 37signals does use the cloud for experimenting with new products. \u201cWe needed to have some big machines, but we only needed them for 20 minutes,\u201d Mr Heinemeier Hansson says. \u201cThe cloud is ideal for that. It would be wasteful to buy that computer and let it stay idle for 99.99% of the time.\u201d He still recommends the cloud to fledgling businesses. \u201cWhen you have a speculative start-up and there\u2019s great uncertainty as to whether you\u2019re going to be around in 18 months, you should absolutely not spend your money buying computers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should rent them.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Cloud computing has created huge businesses like AWS and Microsoft's Azure\n\n37signals is not alone in bringing workloads back from the cloud, which is known as cloud repatriation. Digital workspace company Citrix found that 94% of large US organisations it surveyed had worked on repatriating data or workloads from the cloud in the last three years. The reasons cited included security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems and service downtime. Plitch provides software that enables people to modify single-player games, including adjusting the difficulty. It built its own private data centres and repatriated cloud workloads to them, saving an estimated 30% to 40% in costs after two years. \u201cA key factor in our decision was that we have highly proprietary R&D data and code that must remain strictly secure,\u201d says Markus Schaal, managing director at the German firm. \u201cIf our investments in features, patches, and games were leaked, it would be an advantage to our competitors. While the public cloud offers security features, we ultimately determined we needed outright control over our sensitive intellectual property. \"As our AI-assisted modelling tools advanced, we also required significantly more processing power that the cloud could not meet within budget.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe encountered occasional performance issues during heavy usage periods and limited customisation options through the cloud interface. Transitioning to a privately-owned infrastructure gave us full control over hardware purchasing, software installation, and networking optimized for our workloads.\u201d\n\nPulsant Mark Turner's firm gives companies an alternative to the cloud\n\nMark Turner, chief commercial officer at Pulsant, helps companies to migrate from the cloud to Pulsant\u2019s colocation data centres across the UK. In a colocation arrangement the client owns the IT hardware, but houses it with another firm, where it can be kept securely, at the right temperature and with power back-up. \u201cThe cloud is going to continue to be the biggest part of IT infrastructure, but there is a good place for local, physical, secure infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a repatriation going on of the things that should never have been in the cloud or that won\u2019t work in the cloud.\u201d Some his biggest clients for repatriation are online software providers, where each additional customer puts more load on the server, increasing cloud costs. One such client is LinkPool, which enables smart contracting using blockchain. It was developed in public cloud, initially using free credits. Business exploded, and the cloud bill reached $1m per month. Using colocation, costs shrunk by up to 85%. \u201c[The founder has] now got four racks in a data centre in the city where he lives and works, connected to the world. He goes up against his competitors and he can move his price point around because his cost is not going to move in line [with customer demand],\u201d says Mr Turner. \u201cThe change leaders in the IT industry are now the people who are not saying cloud first, but are saying cloud when it fits,\u201d he adds. \u201cFive years ago, the change disruptors were cloud first, cloud first, cloud first.\u201d",

Typical household incomes went up by just \u00a3140 a year, new analysis from the Resolution Foundation showed.

The Resolution Foundation said the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and high inflation had all contributed to the slowdown, but that growth in general had also been \"sluggish\". That resulted in income rises \"slowing to a crawl\" it said, hampering progress in reducing poverty levels.

        "title": "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal",
        "body": "Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\n\n2 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\n\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\" she said. \"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\"\n\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \"releases\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \" he wrote. \"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\".\n\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\n\nGetty Images",

        "body": "IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\n\n2 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\n\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \"clearly\" wanted him to say that \"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\".\n\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\n\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \"perfect\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \"fairly chaotic\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\". Mr Jenkins said this was \"totally inappropriate wording\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \"afflicted\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \"other reasons\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\n\nGuidance sought\n\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data \u201cprobably needs some further investigation\u201d. However, he said the decision to do so would be \u201chighly political\u201d. \"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \"what exactly we should be doing\". Mr Beer asked: \"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\" Mr Jenkins replied: \"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\" \"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\" Mr Jenkins responded: \"I don't know what to say to that.\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\n\n'I can't remember what I believed'",

        "body": "'How will we afford children with rent increases?'\n\n2 days ago By Alix Hattenstone, Miguel Roca-Terry and Jonathan Fagg , BBC England Data Unit Share\n\nDelia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage\n\nThe average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost \u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \u201cchronic shortage\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\n\n'All of us have been homeless'\n\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \u201cI was looking at my friends \u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\u2019t afford a house?\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \u00a31,312 to \u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\n\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\n\nHow has rent changed in your area?\n\nWhy has rent been increasing?\n\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \"geometric average\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\" he said. \"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\n\nWhere has rent increased the most?\n\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \u00a3555 in December 2019, to \u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\n\n'It was like a bidding war'\n\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \u2018mini budget\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth. This included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed \"Liz Truss' botched budget\" for \"driving up rents for tenants\" and a Labour spokesperson said \"time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters\". A Conservative Party spokesman said \u201cCovid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels\u201d, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. \u201cPeople were offering over the asking price or six months\u2019 rent up front. I wasn\u2019t in a position to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like a bidding war \u2013 I\u2019d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.\u201d Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for \u00a3900 per month. She said: \u201cI feel sorry for my children because my daughter\u2019s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 \u2013 he has to help me out with rent. He\u2019s unable to save up for his future.\u201d\n\nHow does your area compare to the rest of England?\n\nWhat do the different parties promise on rent?\n\nConservatives: Build 1.6 million homes over five years, introduce a new Help to Buy scheme requiring a 5% deposit and scrap stamp duty for properties up to \u00a3425,000 Labour: Help build 1.5 million homes over five years, introduce a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers, and end rental bidding wars. Extend protections around damp, mould and cold. Liberal Democrats: Build 380,000 homes a year and make three-year tenancies the default Reform UK: Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system for social housing, and encourage more people to become landlords by scrapping some taxes Green Party: Create 150,000 new social homes a year, implement rent controls and bring empty homes back into use",

        "body": "Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?\n\n2 days ago By Kevin Keane , BBC Scotland environment correspondent Share\n\nPA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing\n\n\"Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?\" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \"unlicenced\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\n\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\n\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\n\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \"at risk\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\n\nJob forecasts",

        "title": "Tata Steel: Families put plans on hold amid job loss worries",
        "body": "Steelwork closures' ripple effect on town's wages\n\n3 days ago By Paul Heaney , BBC Wales Investigates Share\n\nOwen Midwinter Owen and his girlfriend Cori are just some of thousands affected by the decision to close blast furnaces at Port Talbot Steelworks\n\nOwen Midwinter thought he had a \"job for life\" when he started a five-year apprenticeship at Tata Steel in Port Talbot. But 18 months on, that security has been replaced with uncertainty - and the 23-year-old and his girlfriend may have to delay their plans to start a family. New analysis for the BBC suggests his town could lose more than \u00a3200m in wages because of job cuts at the steelworks. Prof Calvin Jones, its author, said it was an \"end of an era\" for UK steelmaking, similar to the closure of coal mines in the 1980s.\n\nMr Midwinter said of when the job losses were announced: \"Everyone in the room went silent... wives and girlfriends were ringing, one of the boys had to go for a walk to clear his head. \"My old man\u2019s been here for years and years, my grandfather\u2019s been here and it was a proud moment for me. But it\u2019s very sombre now, a lot of sad faces, lot of depression.\" His girlfriend, Cori, said: \"If Owen loses his job it puts the house at risk, we want to start a family soon, but it puts everything at risk until we know.\"\n\nTown of Steel - BBC Wales Investigates Watch the full programme on BBC iPlayer.\n\nTata said it needed to \"act now\" to protect the future of the business by closing blast furnaces and moving to greener ways of producing steel, which require fewer people. Some experts say a lack of a clear strategy by successive UK governments is behind the job cuts in the well-paid industry, which may never be replaced.\n\nMandie Pugh hasn't lost her sense of humour, but is worried about her business and her family\n\nBut it is not just steelworkers who are facing uncertainty. A stone's throw from the Port Talbot plant that dominates the skyline in this part of the south Wales coast, Mandie Pugh runs a catering business built on the trade of the workers. \"I\u2019ve been here 35 years, a long time, and I\u2019m too young to retire,\" she said. \"Contractors, small businesses, from the vegetable man to the window cleaner, people are not going to be able to afford as much any more. \"My husband works at the steelworks, my son is in the control room in the blast furnace so he\u2019s out of a job, he\u2019s just had a baby not long ago, he and his partner are looking for a house so that\u2019s put the kibosh on that. \"I\u2019m gutted for him.\"\n\nProfessor Calvin Jones said the most \"alarming\" figures were on the impact of wages in the town\n\nProf Jones, from Cardiff University, carried out the research for BBC Wales Investigates. It suggests that the 2,000 or so jobs lost directly at Tata sites in Wales could be joined by a further 3,000 roles that rely on Tata for trade. But he said the most \"alarming\" figures were on the impact of wages in Port Talbot. The economics professor estimated the job losses at Tata would see a 10% drop in the town's gross earnings - \u00a3133m a year. If half of the supply companies were based locally, he estimated the drop in earnings would be 15% - more than \u00a3200m. \"That's \u00a3200m a year gone from a local economy until those people find new jobs or other employment comes in. \"So, I guess the question will be what happens instead? \"We have not had an industrial strategy worthy of the name for 40 years\u2026 we don't seem to know where we want to go industrially, so it's no surprise you don't get there. \u201cI think more widely, in the same way as the miners strike and thereafter, it was the end of the era for the valleys, this is the end of an era for industrial south Wales.\u201d\n\nJess Ralston has researched the steel industry for the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank\n\n\u201cIt's heartbreaking to see any sort of job losses, but on this scale it's really quite shocking\u2026 the industry is crying out for a clear plan.\u201d Jess Ralston has researched how countries across Europe are supporting the steel industry to modernise and reduce carbon emissions. \u201cThe new economic reality is the rest of the world is moving towards greener solutions, greener steel.\" She said Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands were \"putting out feelers\" for investment, but the UK was \"standing at the side waiting for the investment to come to them\". \"We've got just one or two green steel projects in the pipeline, Europe has around 40 and it's not just Europe, China, the US, the rest of the world is also looking at the future of steel, and the UK can't really afford to stand still.\"\n\nTata Steel's site in Port Talbot is set to lose the bulk of almost 3,000 jobs across the UK\n\nRajesh Nair, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said he knew how \"painful\" the move would be after 35 years in the industry. \"We are haemorrhaging cash, and it's not because of the lack of efforts of the people or the amount of money that we have been spending, it's simply because we have a set of assets which are end of life. \"We are today as a business, at a fork in the road\u2026 it's either now or never.\u201d\n\nStuart Phillips said he thought working at the Port Talbot steelworks was a job for life\n\nStuart Phillips, 43, has two daughters aged three and 18, and a mortgage. \u201cI\u2019m probably looking for another 15 years' work, and the difficulty I\u2019ve got is Tata Steel is all I\u2019ve ever known. \"It\u2019s quite devastating.\"\n\nStuart Phillips Stuart Phillips has two daughters\n\nImported steel will still be rolled and if the \u00a3500m deal with the current Conservative government is signed off, a new electric arc furnace will be built on the site securing some jobs. Labour said it would offer a better deal, without giving details, and Plaid Cymru argued Tata\u2019s site at Port Talbot ought to be nationalised to support a \"just transition\" to \"green steel\". The Liberal Democrats want a long term vision for the steel industry, while the Reform party said there was a risk the steel works would be a casualty of the \"net zero vanity projects\". The Green Party has called for a green industrial strategy to create sustainable, green jobs. Ms Ralston said it was the decisions of politicians \u2013 past, present and future \u2013 which would dictate the future of the industry. \u201cTata at the end of the day are a multinational company\u2026if the UK doesn't have a very good investment landscape, they don't need to put it here.\u201d",

        "title": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?",
        "body": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?\n\n2 days ago By Emma Woollacott , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores\n\nAmazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.\n\nAmazon was quick to claim that the reports were \u201cerroneous\u201d, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that \u201cthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common\u201d. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question \u2013 whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d in reference to the environmental \"green washing\".\n\nBut first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called \"generative AI\". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. \"Some founders seem to believe that if they don\u2019t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,\" says Mr Ayangar. \"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.\"\n\nSri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI\n\nIt is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as \"AI start-ups\" in fact used virtually no AI at all. \"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,\" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that \"cutting-edge AI capabilities\" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.\n\nDouglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. \"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. \"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.\" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: \"If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.\"\n\nRegulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. \"The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,\" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nNick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem",

        "body": "The screen tech that can do almost anything\n\n4 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nLink\u00f6ping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. \u201cThis is difficult but we think it\u2019s possible.\" In today\u2019s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone\u2019s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice demonstration\u2026 it\u2019s very new,\u201d says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled \u2013 at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. \u201cBy slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,\u201d says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. \u201cIf you think about mass production, this is gigantic.\u201d There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable \u2013 they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue \u2013 the key hues required for full colour digital displays.\n\nTo keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there\u2019s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn\u2019t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV\u2019s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It\u2019s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today\u2019s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.\n\nHelio Helio's film can re-emit blue light as either red or green with little light loss\n\nThe technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren\u2019t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.",

        "body": "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'\n\n5 days ago By Sameer Hashmi , Middle East Business Correspondent BBC News Share\n\nShutterstock The Line, a planned 170km long linear city, may now initially extend for only 2.4km\n\n\u201cThey can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.\u201d That was the response of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia\u2019s flagship construction projects. Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true. In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030. This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state\u2019s de-facto ruler, to transition the country\u2019s economy away from oil-dependency. As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or \u201cgiga projects\u201d as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.\n\nBut low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies. An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon. \u201cThe decision will be based on multiple factors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.\u201d Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (\u00a3394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country. The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.\n\nGetty Images Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to diversify the country's economy\n\nThe original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants. But according to people familiar with the details \u2013 and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module. When The Line was first announced it was billed as a \u201ccarbon-free linear city\u201d that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids. The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits. How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear. Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029. Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately \u201cdesigned to be over ambitious\u201d. \u201cIt was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,\u201d says Mr Shihabi.\n\nThe scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing. Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country\u2019s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world\u2019s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year. The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.\n\nTim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future. \u201cIt is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,\u201d Mr Callen says. The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital. Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019. The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production. Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel. The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh\u2019s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors. \u2018It\u2019s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,\u201d says Mr Callen. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.\u201d The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The stock market waned in the final stretch of a solid quarter, with traders keeping a close eye on any news regarding the US presidential race and remaining cautious ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections in France.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders are rearranging their positions in the aftermath of the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s shaky performance boosted sentiment around Trump\u2019s odds for securing a second term in the White House. Private prisons, oil and health-insurance firms \u2014 some of the groups that would potentially win from another Trump presidency \u2014 rallied, while renewable energy and pot stocks sank. Treasury curve-steepening also followed the presidential debate.\n\n\u201cA very bad night for Biden,\u201d said Libby Cantrill at Pacific Investment Management Co. \u201cFor markets, the biggest takeaway from last night is that deficits will remain high and tariffs are likely going up, especially if Trump gets elected. The question is when this will be priced-into markets.\u201d\n\nAfter gaining almost 1% earlier Friday, the S&P 500 fell to around 5,460. Long-term Treasuries largely underperformed shorter maturities. Bonds had earlier gained as inflation data bolstered bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts. The dollar edged lower, while capping its sixth-straight week of gains.\n\nIn late hours, the biggest US banks took turns announcing higher payouts to investors after easily passing the Fed\u2019s annual stress test earlier this week.\n\nThe US presidential election and its aftermath promises investors big market swings in the second half of the year, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s Scott Rubner.\n\n\u201cI would be looking to trim exposure up here post July 4th,\u201d Rubner wrote.\n\nAndrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities reiterated his commment that a Trump victory in the debate would put pressure on the long-end of the bond market.\n\n\u201cMassive steepening,\u201d Brenner said. \u201cAgain, we don\u2019t like talking about politics, but everyone believes Trump won the debate on a weak performance from Biden. Fears of what tariffs, lack of concern for the deficit (both parties), and continued fear of increasing Treasury issuance, will do for the curve... Steepen it out... That is what we have seen today.\u201d\n\nTo rate strategists at Barclays Plc watching the presidential debate Thursday night, the trade was clear: buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Trump appearing more likely to unseat Biden in the November election, the market should \u201cbe pricing in a considerable risk of higher-than-target inflation in the coming years, and this is from a starting point of our thinking they already offered structural value,\u201d Barclays strategists Michael Pond and Jonathan Hill said in a note.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Marko Kolanovic says the S&P 500 will falter in coming months in the face of mounting headwinds, from a slowing economy to downward earnings revisions. The gauge is poised to plunge to 4,200 by year-end, a roughly 23% drop from current levels.\n\nStocks are heading into the second half having gained almost 15% this year. Historically, a strong first half tends to be followed by above-average second-half returns, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\n\u201cWhile elevated valuations, overbought conditions, and underwhelming market breadth point to a potential pause ahead, seasonal trends suggest momentum could continue in the second half,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe S&P 500 has followed up a positive first-half return with an average second-half gain of 6%, Turnquist added. Furthermore, when first-half gains were 10% or higher, the index posted average gains of 7.7% in the second half, with 83% of occurrences producing positive results.\n\nEarlier in the session, traders kept a close eye on economic data.\n\nUS consumer sentiment declined by less than initially estimated on expectations inflationary pressures will moderate. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of underlying US inflation decelerated. Household spending rebounded and incomes showed solid growth, offering some hope that price pressures can be tamed without lasting damage to consumers.\n\n\u201cFrom the market\u2019s perspective, today\u2019s PCE report was near perfect,\u201d said David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s favorite inflation indicator not only showed inflation was moving towards the Fed\u2019s inflation target, but that the economy is resilient. Consumer spending was on the rise and take-home pay was also up after a couple of sluggish months.\u201d\n\nTo Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, while the inflation data is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed, the policy path is not yet certain.\n\n\u201cA further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cThe soft inflation data will build the case that the Fed can start cutting rates in the coming months,\u201d said Jeffrey Roach at LPL Financial. \u201cAs long as incomes grow at a healthy clip, consumers will keep spending. The key is the labor market and so now, we should shift our attention to next week\u2019s nonfarm payroll release for a fresh look into the job market.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the first rate cut matters because bonds rally in anticipation of that cut, according to Joe Kalish at Ned Davis Research.\n\n\u201cAny second half bond market outlook is contingent on Fed policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing of the first rate cut has historically been important for the bond market, as yields tend to peak 2-3 months before the first rate cut.\u201d\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nNike Inc.\u2019s management team, led by Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe, is facing growing criticism from Wall Street as a prolonged sales slump sparked the stock\u2019s biggest rout since the company went public in 1980.\n\nUber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. agreed to a series of worker benefits to resolve a longstanding state lawsuit in Massachusetts that challenged drivers\u2019 employment status as independent contractors, putting a stop to the companies\u2019 bid to take the issue before voters in November.\n\nRite Aid Corp. has been cleared to exit bankruptcy after winning court approval on a restructuring plan that\u2019s poised to save the ailing pharmacy chain from liquidation by handing control of the business to key creditors.\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\u2019s $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is set to come under added scrutiny from European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdogs, who are poised to quiz rivals about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology.\n\nNokia Oyj has agreed to buy Infinera Corp. in a $2.3 billion deal that will expand the company\u2019s networking products for data centers and increase its presence in the US, a potentially key source of growth as the boom in artificial intelligence drives demand for server capacity.\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4 p.m. New York time\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.5%\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%\n\nThe MSCI World Index fell 0.3%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.0710\n\nThe British pound was little changed at $1.2641\n\nThe Japanese yen was little changed at 160.92 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 2.2% to $60,082.15\n\nEther fell 1.8% to $3,377.67\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced 11 basis points to 4.39%\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced five basis points to 2.50%\n\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 4.17%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.3% to $81.53 a barrel\n\nSpot gold fell 0.2% to $2,324.07 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Menton, Alexandra Semenova, Felice Maranz, Carmen Reinicke, Emily Forgash, Natalia Kniazhevich and Ye Xie.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "Kenya has long been a focal point for business opportunities in East Africa.\n\nHowever, the current economic landscape poses several challenges, which businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), must navigate skillfully.\n\nHigh interest rates, high taxation, and fluctuations in disposable income have created a complex environment, demanding strategic thinking and adaptability from entrepreneurs.\n\nThe financial strain caused by these factors has not only affected the bottom line of SMEs but has also restricted their capacity for growth. Evolving consumer spending patterns further compound the situation.\n\nTo weather these economic challenges, businesses must explore diverse revenue and income streams.\n\nProduct diversification in alignment with market needs and expanding the capacities of SMEs are critical strategies. Understanding the market landscape and consumer demands will enable businesses to tailor their offerings to include complementary goods or services that align with their core competencies.\n\nDiversifying within one\u2019s expertise not only leverages existing client relationships but also establishes new revenue streams. Ancillary offers, such as maintenance services and personalised consultations, exemplify this approach.\n\nGeographical expansion is another formidable strategy. The exploration of untapped markets, whether regional or global and the tailoring of offerings to meet the diverse needs of consumer segments positions SMEs to flourish in various economic landscapes.\n\nMeanwhile, in today\u2019s rapidly evolving business environment, the cost structure of SMEs is crucial for sustainability. Digitisation and automation offer significant opportunities for streamlining operations and reducing costs. Embracing technology not only enhances efficiency but also opens up new delivery channels like e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach wider audiences, and adapt to changing consumer behaviours.\n\nWhile access to working capital remains a pressing issue for SMEs, collaborative efforts between financial institutions, government bodies, and private sector stakeholders can pave the way for more accessible and affordable financing solutions.\n\nFinally, the importance of benchmarking and networking cannot be overstated. SMEs can leverage partnerships with organisations such as the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to access valuable resources, mentorship, and business intelligence. Strategic partnerships may generate synergies that open doors to new clients, distribution channels, and revenue streams.\n\nForums and industry events provide a platform for networking, knowledge exchange, and identifying potential collaborations.",

Hellen Obiri is highlighted for her back-to-back Boston Marathon victories, the company introduced its CloudTec Phase cushioning platform with the On Cloudsurfer, its flagship store on Regent Street in London, the success of its two great tennis athletes, Iga Swiatek and Ben Shelton are highlighted, as well as several other initiatives including the expansion of its product offerings into footwear for kids and pre-teens.\n\nThese are all critical components of my investment thesis in ONON. Brand recognition is a critically important part of the success and sustainability of an athleisure company, especially for a premium footwear and apparel company like ONON. ONON expects to increase brand recognition by designing innovative and differentiated products and finding success in elite athletics, using its\"lightning and rain strategy\" to turn this success into broader adoption among consumers. It has a growing list of elite athletes, some of whom are major global champions and some who will showcase their abilities during the summer Olympic Games in Paris. Innovative new shoe designs, like On\u2019s Cloudtec platform are expected to push the brand forward to achieve higher penetration, help maintain relevance, and create avenues for expansion into different product categories. Expansion into different age and sport demographics is essential in growing the company from more of a niche player into a major competitor to the largest shoemakers in the world. The company maintains extreme levels of pricing discipline, which shows its pricing power with customers and is evidenced by the lack of discounts online or in-stores. ONON has updated its footwear lineup, simplified its sizing, and is hosting running hubs for athletes to recover and the running community to gather during the games in Paris, where co-founder, David Allemann, says to, \u201cExpect groundbreaking On product innovation to show up at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nI believe ONON has a huge opportunity and a long runway for growth ahead of it. The company is a potential DCF breaker. One that might be able to outlast everyone\u2019s DCF models by maintaining stellar free cash flow growth and then maintaining a better-than-GDP growth rate for many years beyond. The investment is not without risk, as the athletic footwear and apparel space is highly competitive, and consumer preferences can be fickle.\n\nIf ONON is able to successfully scale its footwear business, expand its apparel offerings and sales, and continue to expand operating and free cash flow margins, it should scale into a much larger company and turn out to be an incredible investment.\n\nIn this article, I will cover the story of On, my personal investigation into the company\u2019s products and why I think the company is growing in relevance and has the potential to achieve the success of Hoka. Using Hoka\u2019s growth trajectory, I will lay out the potential for the stock.\n\nPeter Lynch Style Investing\n\nThe famed investor Peter Lynch believes that individual investors can find great investment opportunities by paying attention to products and services they encounter daily. He believes everyday observations and experiences can provide valuable insights about companies with strong growth potential.\n\nI agree with Peter Lynch, but extend that sentiment beyond my own experiences. Sometimes, we can gain insight from the experiences and insights of others. In other words, I should have been paying closer attention to my friend Laine, who introduced me to On brand shoes 13 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m walking on clouds,\u201d she told me. For too long, I dismissed On footwear as a gimmick, despite seeing people around me adopting the shoes as their trusted footwear option. I don\u2019t know anyone who has grown tired of their On shoes.\n\nMy hesitance with ONON as an investment stemmed from never owning a pair of On shoes. I\u2019m a picky shoe guy, I run in Brooks and Hoka One One. I have two pairs of North Face Trail racers. I hate Nike, they don\u2019t fit me well. I never even considered On running shoes until recently. They looked funny and didn\u2019t carry the weight of a known brand like Nike, Brooks, New Balance, or Adidas.\n\nWhen I think about upstart running shoe companies, the first thing that comes to mind is Hoka. Hoka seemingly came out of nowhere in the 2010s, as a niche shoemaker for ultrarunners at a time when the minimalist shoe trend was in full force. Hoka provided something that the minimalist shoes and traditional shoe designers didn\u2019t offer: a comfortable shoe for long-distance runners. Minimalist shoes just don\u2019t work for everyone. Hoka might have opened the door to a company like On to become what it is today.\n\nUsing Decker\u2019s (DECK) financial statements, Hoka has expanded its wholesale operating margins from 19.3% in 2019 to 33.4% in 2024 and grown revenue at a 43% CAGR and operating income at a 60% CAGR during this timeframe. Hoka is a great comp for ONON, and better than LULU due to the common business lines that the companies operate in. Hoka is older and already has a larger apparel segment than ONON. This shows the potential that ONON has to grow.\n\nDECK SEC Filings\n\nTo determine if I think ONON has the potential to be like Hoka, I went down to my local running and sports store, Sports Basement, to try on some ONON shoes and learn more about the products. This local chain typically has a wide variety of running shoes and athletic apparel. I was able to glean some insight through this visit, and even though its just one experience, it backs up some of what ONON management says about its products, that it does not discount, and the potential for the company to hold pricing power and gain market share through increased brand recognition.\n\nThe Products\n\nTo summarize my 90-minute shoe testing session, I will just say that the last time I fell in love with an emerging premium running shoe brand was in the early 2010s, and that brand was Hoka One One. I\u2019m in love with On\u2019s shoes. I'm not ready to put them in the same elite tier of running shoes as Hoka or Brooks, but I ended up walking out with a pair of On Cloudsurfers to be an alternate distance trainer and will be purchasing the On Cloud 5 for my daily athleisure shoes through ONON\u2019s DTC option or through my local store's online system to get the color that I want. For my liking, the Cloudsurfers struck the perfect balance between cushioning, comfort, and performance. The Cloudtec platform really does give me the sensation of running on clouds, and I can see why so many people love these shoes.\n\nONON Online Shop - Cloudsurfer\n\nAt Sports Basement, I observed some interesting things. First, the shoes had considerably less shelf space than Hoka, Nike, and Brooks. On has fewer models than some of the larger shoemakers, so this was expected. The women's section had a significantly higher selection and stock than the men's, which was interesting to see. Perhaps On targets and sells better to women. From an investing angle, I like to see this. Women hold tremendous economic power and generally hold a big influence over household spending. I wonder if this could bode well for growth in the kids segment, as women are generally more likely to do back-to-school shopping for their children and buy them shoes when needed. If women are satisfied with On shoes, they might be more likely to dress their kids in On.\n\nSome of the men's models only had three pairs left, but they remained on the full-price rack. This takes me to the second thing I observed. There wasn't a single On shoe on the clearance rack. The clearance rack was filled with various shoes, from Hoka, Nike, Brooks, Adidas, and Alta, but there were no On shoes on the clearance rack. Normally, when a shoe gets very low in stock at Sports Basement, they are moved to the clearance rack. Sports Basement's shoe department staff are some of the most knowledgeable you'll find in a big sports apparel store. When I talked to the veteran shoe department employee on duty, he told me that On shoes never make it to the clearance rack and are some of the store's bestsellers.\n\nThis is one of the most bullish things I can think of. ONON does not habitually discount its products; in fact, as you can see on the company\u2019s store page, nothing is on sale. This differentiates between On and a struggling company like Under Armour (UAA). It\u2019s also a different policy than Hoka, which runs routine sales on its running shoes.\n\nThere was no ONON Apparel at Sports Basement, though it seems like it would fit in well with the mix of moderate-priced and premium apparel offerings at the store. This is a tremendous growth opportunity for ONON, as only 5% of its revenue comes from apparel sales.\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the shoes and the opportunity the company has to gain greater shelf space and expand into apparel. The shoes were superior to the On model I tried on years ago, and the selection was far greater. However, the company lacks the same brand power as the bigger and more established players. This is just one personal experience, but it tells me that ONON has improved its shoe's technology by leaps and bounds. The lack of clearance shelf space and the commentary from the shoe department staff member supported the idea that ONON is a premium shoe brand, holds some level of pricing power, and is easy to sell. But the lack of overall shelf space shows that it lacks the brand power of the larger competitors and has the potential to grow a great deal if it continues to take market share.\n\nHow can ONON be a great investment from today\u2019s seemingly high valuations?\n\nThe Story\n\nOn\u2019s lightning and rain strategy is what the company believes will push its brand recognition to greater levels. During the Q1 earnings call, management discussed the strategy:\n\n\u201cThe lightning and rain strategy, winning on the racecourse with next-level innovation, and gaining market share with everyday runners, continues to deliver for the On brand. Three weeks ago, Hellen Obiri won the marathon in Boston for the second time, the first woman in two decades to go back to back. She was running in On head to toe, including a groundbreaking new footwear technology, which On will reveal in Paris this summer.\u201d\n\nOn spoke about the market share gains it is achieving and attributed this success to the adoption of its latest high-performance running shoe franchises, the Cloudmonster, Cloudsurfer, and Cloudrunner shoes.\n\nThe lightning and rain strategy could be particularly effective this summer with the return of the Summer Olympic Games in Paris, beginning in late July. The lightning refers to winning races at the elite level. I believe that the lightning part is more than just about winning Olympic medals, but in On athletes making Olympic finals and winning national championships.\n\nOn holds a growing list of athletes sporting the On logo on their chests and feet; some of the more notable athletes are the aforementioned Obiri, tennis champions Ben Shelton and Iga Swiatek, top ten triathletes Pierre Le Corre, Jesper Svensson and Kate Waugh, and track athletes Yared Nuguse, Olli Hoare, Geordie Beamish, and Alexandra Burghardt.\n\nThe USA has one On athlete, in particular, that may make waves in Paris, Yared Nuguse is no worse than the fourth or fifth best 1,500 meter runner in the world and will likely go into Paris with a great shot at making the podium in one of the most exciting finals that will be run. The men\u2019s 1,500 final may be one of the great spectacles of the games, with two trash-talking distance runners from Norway and the U.K., Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr, commanding the attention of a worldwide audience. The soft-spoken Nuguse won the silver medal at this year's World Indoor Championships in the 3,000 meters and is not just a candidate to win a medal but could be a dark-horse gold medalist contender.\n\nTwitter - X - @on_running & @CitiusMag\n\nDo not be surprised if there is a press release, the morning after the Men\u2019s 1,500 meter final, congratulating Yared Nuguse for winning an Olympic Medal. If this happens, every middle-distance track nerd in the United States will idolize Nuguse and see him running in an On singlet for the foreseeable future. This is the brand recognition that will improve On\u2019s standing in the running community, which could then bleed into the rain part of the strategy, where the company gets recognized by a wide audience of athletes and non-athletes alike.\n\nThe notable On athletes from other nations should not be dismissed. Track and Field is a huge sport in many non-U.S. countries, and it sponsors national record holders, European and national champions, Olympic finalists, and up-and-coming athletes. If any of them make a splash at the Olympics, it could help boost the company\u2019s profile and drive brand recognition. Another up-and-coming American runner is On athlete, Juliette Whittaker, who punched her ticket to Paris by placing third in the U.S. women\u2019s 800-meter Olympic Trials.\n\nTwitter - X - @on_running & @CitiusMag\n\nThe rain part of the lightning and rain strategy is where On looks to scale its business far beyond elite athletes and into everyday athletes and casual consumers. Leveraging the Olympics and pro sports is just one way that On looks to make it rain on the rest of the global athletic apparel and footwear markets.\n\nGrowth\n\nONON has grown revenue at a 58% CAGR and operating income at a CAGR of 124%, since 2019. Free cash flow went from a loss of 287.3 million Swiss francs in 2022 to a gain of 271.5 million in the TTM period. The company is debt-free.\n\nFinChat\n\nMargin expansion is a critical piece of my investment thesis. The company turned profitable in 2022 and has inflected margins higher since then. ONON has expanded operating and free cash flow margins largely due to gross margin expansion.\n\nFinChat\n\nRevenues are growing faster than SG&A expenses, and its operating leverage has kicked into effect. At some point, the company may scale large enough and be able to decrease its SG&A to revenue ratio, further driving operating margin expansion.\n\nFinChat\n\nFootwear design comes with high upfront costs. ONON\u2019s positioning as a premium shoe brand should help maintain pricing better than discount shoemakers. If ONON is able to grow its offerings and sales, it should benefit from greater economies of scale, streamline expenses, and enjoy the operating leverage that comes with this industry.\n\nONON plans to continue increasing marketing expenses to drive brand awareness. Marketing expenses as a percentage of sales were 10.9% in 2023 and 10.7% in 2022. Digital acquisition expenses, investments into sponsorships with elite athletes, and collaborations with artists are also part of On\u2019s growth initiatives. Investments in inventory growth and distribution network enhancements in recent years are meant to increase supply and efficiency.\n\nGrowth investments are paying off, and the company\u2019s ROIC shows that it should continue to invest in growth. I will keep a close eye on ROIC in the coming quarters and years to ensure that the company continues to benefit from its growth initiatives.\n\nFinChat\n\nValuation\n\nONON appears expensive on the surface, earning a D- from Seeking Alpha Quant. A forward P/E of 46x and P/S of 4.8x might be offset by its PEG ratio of 1.21, which is rated as a B. This shows that the company has high earnings growth potential.\n\nSeeking Alpha Valuation\n\nLet\u2019s lay out a path to market-beating returns for ONON. I\u2019ve created a DCF model with base, bear, and bull cases. DCF models are inherently flawed, but can give us an idea of what growth ONON requires to generate great shareholder returns.\n\nMy bull case assumes that ONON exceeds the company\u2019s stated 3-year revenue guidance (30.0% vs 26.0% CAGR) before declining, as shown in the table below. It also assumes that ONON grows to be almost as profitable as Hoka. Using DECK\u2019s stated Hoka wholesale segment operating margin of 33.4% as a comp, I have modeled ONON to expand its operating margin to 32.0% by 2034. Hoka expanded its OM from 19.3% to 33.4% over five years, so I\u2019m modeling a lower expansion rate (13.0% to 32.0% over ten-plus years) than Hoka has achieved and a lower OM than Hoka\u2019s. Hoka\u2019s shoe prices are a bit higher than ONON\u2019s, I expect a lower OM, all else being equal.\n\nAuthor-generated model\n\nMy base case assumes that ONON meets its 2024 revenue growth guidance of 30.0% and its minimum target of a 26% CAGR from 2023-2026. From 2027 on, the revenue is modeled to gradually decline each year. For my base case, OM only expands to 16.5%, which is only half that of Hoka. In this scenario, the company doesn\u2019t enjoy the significant gains in efficiency that the bull case assumes, but the company is able to expand OM. The same 90% OCF to FCF conversion is used.\n\nAuthor-generated model\n\nMy bear case assumes that ONON underperforms its 2024 revenue growth guidance (only 28%), and its minimum target of a 26% CAGR from 2023-2026 (only 25%). From 2027 on, the revenue is modeled to decline faster. For my bear case, OM only expands to 15.0%. The same 90% OCF to FCF conversion is used.\n\nAuthor-generated model\n\nFor my DCF, I am using a 14.0% discount rate, because of the risk involved with investing in a high-growth shoe and apparel retailer and the hopes to achieve a high rate of return for this investment. For my base case, I am using a 3.0% terminal rate because if the company can sustain high growth for ten years, it is unlikely to suddenly fall to GDP-level growth. The bear case uses a 2.5% terminal rate, and the bull case an abnormally high 4.0% terminal rate. On has a potential for a long growth runway; therefore, higher terminal rates are acceptable, in my opinion.\n\nEven though I modeled growth in Swiss francs, I am using free cash flow in USD for my DCF model. Using a TTM free cash flow of $304 million and the Free cash flow growth rates outlined above, the stock could be reasonably valued for someone hoping to achieve a 14.0% annual rate of return in ONON. Again, DCF models are inherently flawed due to long projections that can never be accurate. What this model illustrates is that ONON has the potential to crush the market if it successfully scales similarly to Hoka, and that if the company is able to maintain a loyal and growing base of customers, that the downside is outweighed by the upside, if my assumptions are anywhere close to actual results.\n\nAuthor-Generated DCF Model Author-Generated DCF model Calculations\n\nRisks\n\nONON is in a very competitive industry and requires high-growth to continue for at least five to ten years, and sustained growth and profitability thereafter. The fickle nature of consumers is a real risk to the investment thesis. A recession could also hamper the company\u2019s growth, as premium shoes may be more discretionary and more likely to be cut from someone\u2019s budget during tough economic times. Any significant deceleration in growth will likely send the share price down.\n\nConclusion\n\nDoes ONON have that \u2018it\u2019 factor that will propel it to having its Hoka like growth story? ONON\u2019s CloudTec technology platform could be what sets it apart in the minds of its customers. Much like how Hoka started with shoes and now supports the complete apparel needs of runners and athletes, ONON has the same opportunity. Today, I have Hoka running shoes, the ora recovery sandals, Hoka shoes that I use for walking, Hoka track spikes, a Hoka running top, and a Hoka running hat. This is the opportunity that lies in front of ONON. It\u2019s likely a marathon\u2019s distance away right now, but it\u2019s a potentially great opportunity for investors if the company can continue to take market share and succeed in expanding into kids products, new sports and grow its apparel business.\n\nI consider ONON to be a buy, but a stock that I will slowly add into given the long-term thesis and risk.",

        "body": "Believe it or not, we're nearly halfway through this decade. The healthcare sector could be in store for monumental changes over the next few years.\n\nThese changes should present great opportunities for investors to make money. But where should they put their money? I predict these could be the best-performing healthcare stocks through 2030 (listed by descending market cap).\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) already ranks among the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. It has built a market cap of over $120 billion on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. But I think Vertex's growth prospects through the rest of the decade will come from non-CF therapies.\n\nThe big drugmaker already has one product outside of CF on the market. Vertex is ramping up the commercial launch of Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is a one-time functional cure for these two rare blood diseases.\n\nI predict that Vertex will add three other blockbuster drugs that don't treat CF to its lineup by 2030. It seems likely to win U.S. approval of suzetrigine (VX-548) in moderate-to-severe acute pain next year. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 clinical study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Vertex's acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences will give it a late-stage candidate targeting another kidney disease, IgA nephropathy.\n\nDon't be surprised if Vertex achieves major milestones in curing type 1 diabetes over the next few years. The company has two experimental islet cell therapies in phase 1/2 testing that hold tremendous potential in curing the disease that affects roughly 3.8 million individuals in North America and Europe.\n\n2. Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't have an approved product on the market yet. However, its market cap of around $5.2 billion underscores investors' excitement about Viking's pipeline.\n\nThe huge stock gain for Viking in 2024 is primarily due to positive news for its experimental obesity drug, VK2735. Earlier this year, Viking announced impressive results from a phase 2 study of VK2735. The drug achieved greater weight loss after 13 weeks than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nObesity isn't the only big market Viking is going after. A few weeks ago, the company reported positive results from a phase 2 study evaluating VK2809 in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is also known as metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Some analysts project that NASH/MASH could top $100 billion by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not all. Viking also has two early stage programs. It reported promising results in March for an oral version of VK2735. The company is evaluating VK0214 in a phase 1b study targeting X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a rare genetic disorder.\n\n3. TransMedics Group\n\nI don't think the list of big healthcare winners through 2030 will be limited to only biotech stocks. TransMedics Group (NASDAQ: TMDX) could be one of the top-performing medical device stocks through the rest of this decade and beyond. Its market cap of roughly $4.8 billion doesn't reflect the company's potential, in my view.\n\nTransMedics is revolutionizing the organ transplant market. With the current standard of care (using coolers for transportation), most donated hearts, lungs, and livers don't make it to their intended recipient. TransMedics' OCS (Organ Care System) technology keeps organs functioning during transportation. The result: Significantly higher utilization and reduction of severe post-transplant complications.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for TransMedics has been the lack of availability of airplanes to transport organs. That won't be much of a problem going forward, though. The company acquired a charter plane operator and has built its own fleet of aircraft.\n\nI predict TransMedics' OCS will become the standard of care in organ transplants. I also believe the company will expand the size of the U.S. transplant market and move into other countries over time. TransMedics could and should have a much larger market cap by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in TransMedics Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in TransMedics Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and TransMedics Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "NEW YORK, June 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (Maxeon or the Company) (NASDAQ: MAXN) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Maxeon securities between November 15, 2023 and May 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period). Investors have until August 27, 2024 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nClick here to participate in the action.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, before the market opened, Maxeon announced financial results for first quarter 2024 in a press release, reporting a 41% year-over-year decline in revenue to $187.5 million. The Company disclosed that it was facing a serious cash flow challenge as the result of, in part, the termination of the SunPower (NASDAQ: ) supply agreement. The Company revealed that, as a result, it was forced to negotiate[] commitments for significant liquidity support which will result in substantial dilution to existing public shareholders, with TZE [TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy Technology Co. Ltd.] ultimately becoming a controlling shareholder.\n\nOn this news, the Company's share price fell 34.7%, or $1.08, to close at $2.03 per share on May 30, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Maxeon relied on the exclusive sales of certain products to SunPower; (2) that, following the termination of the Master Supply Agreement, the Company was unable to aggressively ramp sales; (3) that, as a result, revenue substantially declined; (4) that, as a result, the Company suffered a serious cash flow crisis; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Maxeon shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com , telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form .

        "body": "Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.\n\nA bench of five judges of the apex court presided by Chief Justice Martha Koome also held that Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act do not contradict or prohibit banks and financial institutions and their customers from bargaining and entering into a mutual contract concerning interest rates that will be applied to loan facilities.\n\nHowever, the judges said interest rates on loans are subject to the regulation under Section 44 of the Banking Act, which states that \u201cNo institution shall increase its rate of banking or other charges except with the prior approval of the Minister.\u201d\n\nAccording to the court, while a contract that is mutually agreed by parties might provide the bank with the discretion to alter or vary interest rates on loans, that discretion is not absolute or unlimited.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion on this issue, we find that interest rates on loans and facilities advanced by banks or financial institutions are subject to the regulatory process under Section 44 of the Banking Act,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe court added the approval of the Treasury Cabinet Secretary before increasing interest rates ensures that there is some check and balance or oversight to ensure that consumers of the loan facilities are not exploited and that the rates are reasonable.\n\nThe Banking (Increase of Rate of Banking And other Charges) Regulations, 2006, states that an application for approval of an increase in the rate of banking or other charges under Section 44 of the Act, shall be submitted to the Minister through the Central Bank of Kenya Governor.\n\nOther Supreme Court judges who made the ruling were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, and Njoki Ndung\u2019u.\n\nThe judges were deciding a long-running dispute between Stanbic Bank and Santowels Ltd, a manufacturer of sanitary towels.\n\nThe manufacturer said its relationship with the bank hit the rocks in 2002 when it began having doubts concerning the interest charged by the lender. The company consequently paid its outstanding debt and closed its accounts with the lender the same year.\n\nSantowels later engaged Interest Rates Advisory Centre (IRAC) Ltd to recalculate the interest charged on the Stanbic loans. IRAC found that the bank had overcharged the manufacturer interest amounting to Sh68 million.\n\nThe firm moved to court seeking a refund of the overcharged interest.\n\nThe matter moved to the Supreme Court as parties sought the court\u2019s interpretation of the two sections of the Banking Act.\n\nThe lender argued in the second appeal that there are various court decisions on whether provisions of Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act apply to other bank charges, commissions, and rates but also to interest.\n\nStanbic Bank argued that there is uncertainty in the law as there are several contradicting decisions from the courts, on the question of rate of banking and interest variation and when ministerial consent is required.\n\nStanbic argued that regulations cannot override the provisions of Section 52(1) of the Banking Act, in cases where contractual charges are already in place.\n\nThe section states that \"For the avoidance of doubt, no contravention of the provisions of this Act or the Central Bank of Kenya Act shall affect or invalidate in any way any contractual obligation between an institution and any other person.\"\n\nSantowels, however, argued that the maximum rate that banks were entitled to charge their customers by law and as gazetted by CBK was 16.5 percent per annum on a reducing balance.\n\nThe court ruled that the interest it was charged was above what had been set by the CBK in 1997, hence illegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the primary objective of the Banking Act is to regulate banking business in Kenya.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the overarching reason for interest rate capping and/or regulation is to protect consumers from exploitative rates, to increase access to finance, and make credit affordable,\u201d the judges added.\n\nThe court held that the effect of the repeal of Section 39 of the CBK Act and Section 33B of the Banking Act did not completely liberalise the interest rates that banks and financial institutions can charge.\n\nRather, it meant that regulation through capped interest rates was no longer in force, the court said.\n\nThe government in September 2016 imposed legal caps on lending rates at four percentage points above the Central Bank\u2019s benchmark \u2014 then prevailing at nine percent \u2014 and set the maximum borrowing rate at 13 percent.\n\nThe caps were scrapped in 2019 after they were found unconstitutional by the High Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the regulation through the capping of interest rates simply set the parameters within which banks and financial institutions and their customers can negotiate or interact on the issue of interest rates.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis and finding with respect to Section 44 of the Banking Act, the provision plays a different regulatory role yet complementary to that which capped interest rates played,\u201d said the judges.",
        "summary": "Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.\nOther Supreme Court judges who made the ruling were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, and Njoki Ndung\u2019u.\nSantowels later engaged Interest Rates Advisory Centre (IRAC) Ltd to recalculate the interest charged on the Stanbic loans.\nRather, it meant that regulation through capped interest rates was no longer in force, the court said.\nThe Supreme Court said the regulation through the capping of interest rates simply set the parameters within which banks and financial institutions and their customers can negotiate or interact on the issue of interest rates.",

I say this because there is a feeling you get when you walk in there, through all those shelves upon shelves of bottles of wine. It\u2019s like walking through an aquarium of alcohol.\n\nYou feel giddy with anticipation even if you don\u2019t care too much about wine. Maybe this feeling is further complemented by the usage of wood. And lighting. It\u2019s all in the simplicity and the flow. Anyhow, whatever it is, a beer to the interior stylist.\n\nI recently sat with a friend in one of those raised tables inside, the one facing the short bar and the back entrance. Cosy little corner, too cosy to be wasted discussing politics. My friend is a typical middle-class who has never teared up from teargas but complains about the state of our governance. She also feels like going to protest is too \u201cdangerous.\u201d That tear gas might get into her hair. (Great hair, I will admit).\n\nThis is a malady that has afflicted us and our parents; taking it on the chin, turning the other cheek. It was my first ever protest and after that, I was calling out all my friends who think protests are for \u201cother people.\u201d I realise that I was quite insufferable.\n\nAnyway, Wine Bar (no fault of theirs) felt like the kind of place people who have never sniffed teargas would gather to talk about teargas and violence. It\u2019s safe and cosy and gorgeous. The staff/sommeliers are friendly and helpful and if you love wine and you have the ambition to go to heaven then you will wonder if that\u2019s not heaven already.",

Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nThe Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nImperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a \u201cjudicial review\u201d challenging the consultation process.\n\nGovernment lawyers responded by saying legal action might \u201cderail\u201d a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.\n\nBAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial\u2019s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.\n\nImperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was \u201ckeeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments\u201d.\n\nThe legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.\n\nPMI\u2019s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s UK subsidiary told the consultation it \u201cdid not support the age of sale ban as outlined\u201d, arguing instead for \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d on \u201ccombustible tobacco\u201d \u2013 ie cigarettes \u2013 instead of an outright ban.\n\nPMI told the Guardian the bill risked \u201cconfusing\u201d consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it \u201cfirmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK\u201d.\n\nBAT, which has previously advocated for a \u201csmokeless\u201d future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.\n\nAs the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a \u201cbusiness lunch\u201d with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company\u2019s annual party at the British Museum in London.\n\nIn May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak\u2019s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,\u201d JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the \u201copen dismissal of industry views in the decision making process\u201d.\n\nIts secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of \u201ctaking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness\u201d.\n\nA month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: \u201cThe principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one \u2026 We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.\u201d\n\nTwo Conservative MPs, including Badenoch\u2019s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved.\n\nThe Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a \u201cnanny state\u201d measure.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Sunak \u2018nanny state\u2019 beermat. Illustration: Howard McWilliam\n\nBadenoch\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch\u2019s department to join Imperial in January.\n\nStafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a \u201clover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information\u201d.\n\nHe and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group\u2019s position in a speech.\n\nThe government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.\n\nIn total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.\n\nBAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: \u201cWe are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative party did not return requests for comment.",

        "body": "Prom Week has arrived in Tennessee, and the class of 2024 is lined up in suits and crowns, posing for pictures by the red carpet. Who says four legs and a tail should stop you from going to the ball?\n\nIt\u2019s just another day in doggy daycare. As well as a graduation ceremony, canines at this facility in Franklin, Tennessee, on the outskirts of Nashville, were recently treated to bark-uterie \u2013 customized charcuterie boards \u2013 and challenged by Sports Week, for which they were dressed up with sweatbands.\n\n\u201cI did have someone tell me that our daycare calendar has more activities than their child\u2019s school,\u201d reflects Samantha Talbot, who manages the site, inside the North American headquarters of Mars Petcare.\n\nThere is method \u2013 and money \u2013 in all this madness. The pet industry is booming. Across the world, the market is projected to swell to almost $500bn by the end of the decade. In the US alone, it is expected to attract more than $150bn in spending this year, up from $97.1bn just five years ago.\n\nMars is at the center of this surge. While perhaps most associated with its myriad brands aimed at humans, from M&Ms and Wrigley\u2019s gum to Dolmio cooking sauce, the sprawling conglomerate \u2013 one of the largest private companies in the world \u2013 now generates more money from its animal-focused businesses than those aimed at people.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dogs at the Mars Petcare headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nIt is behind dozens of pet food brands, including Royal Canin, Pedigree, Sheba and Whiskas, as well as nearly 3,000 veterinary clinics, hospitals and diagnostic labs. Of the $50bn in sales Mars generated in 2023, the company says about 60% came from its pet-care arm.\n\nBut demand is shifting as rapidly as it is growing. A new generation of owners has brought new priorities, concerns and approaches \u2013 as demonstrated by the parades at Mars\u2019s US pet HQ.\n\n\u201cThirty years ago dogs slept in the garden,\u201d Lo\u00efc Moutault, global president of Mars Petcare, noted as he toured some of its Tennessee sites with the Guardian. \u201cNow they sleep in our beds!\u201d\n\nMore people are getting pets earlier in their lives, he said. An estimated 16% of American pet owners are now gen Z.\n\nNot that Mars calls them owners. \u201cPet parents\u201d are less likely to ban their animals from certain rooms, as was once the norm, and more likely to take them away on holiday. \u201cThe depth of the relationship is completely different,\u201d according to Moutault.\n\nThis generation is also far less prepared to trust pet food companies or even vets. Younger owners do their homework \u2013 and readily challenge the vets treating their pets, and the companies making their food. \u201cThis generation is way more cynical, and therefore demanding,\u201d Moutault said, \u201cin terms of how genuine we are about what we are proposing and offering.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Lo\u00efc Moutault.\n\nMars first branched out into the pet industry when it bought the British maker of Chappie canned dog food in 1935. More recently, the company built up a vast chain of veterinary clinics and hospitals through a multibillion-dollar string of takeovers.\n\nThe accelerated growth of its pet-care division has helped Mars double sales across its wider business over the past decade. The man behind its recent expansion in this market, Poul Weihrauch, was promoted to run the whole company in 2022.\n\nTop executives at Mars believe sales in this market will \u2013 and should \u2013 surge for years to come. \u201cPets make a better world for us,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cWe want to make a better world for pets.\u201d\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s Franklin site is complete with a dog park with wifi, how company brass say every office should look. Mars has so far certified nearly 150 US cities as pet-friendly, with homes, businesses and parks that are deemed welcoming. It hopes many more will follow the example of Nashville, which has a pet \u201crelief area\u201d at its airport and a dog park at its hockey arena.\n\nThere is, of course, a vested interest here: a better world for pets also means a better world for Mars. Should the international pet population continue to swell, it\u2019s a reasonable bet that its sales will, too.\n\n\u201cWe are a business, and we are absolutely unapologetic about that,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re not; we are. We are a business, and we are, thankfully, successful, growing, developing.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Employees with their pets at the Mars Petcare headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nThe firm has its fair share of critics. Mars \u201cprofits at the expense of animals and the people who care about them\u201d, said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice-president at the animal rights group Peta, who accused it of \u201cmaking vet care more expensive and less accessible\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, where Mars is one of the biggest owners of veterinary practices, rising pet-care prices have put the industry on a collision course with the country\u2019s anti-trust watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether pet owners are overpaying for medicines and asking if large, integrated vet groups \u201cact in ways which reduce consumer choice\u201d.\n\nAcademics have raised questions, too, about the environmental impact of mass pet food production. And Mars has faced a backlash over its decision to continue operating in Russia after that country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMars pointed to its creation of a climate reformulation team, focused on increasing the use of less carbon-intense ingredients, which it says has already carried out \u201cnumerous reformulations\u201d of recipes.\n\nMore broadly, Moutault insists that the company has a purpose beyond profits. The group is \u201cadvocating for the role of pets in society\u201d, he said. You can actually be cynic[al] about that and say, \u2018Well, do we really need that?\u2019, [but] I actually think human beings are wired to care. There is an inherent satisfaction of caring for a pet. It\u2019s an emotional reward that makes people feel good about themselves.\u201d\n\nPushing back against those who believe his company is purely encouraging the pet boom for its own gain, Moutault argues there are \u201ccountless\u201d benefits of having an animal \u2013 and that many sit hand-in-paw with Mars making money.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While oral hygiene has \u201cmassively evolved\u201d for humans, the development has been less advanced for pets. Mars vet hospitals are offering plans with yearly dental check-ups, in a bid to reduce the chance of tooth removals. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call holistic value creation,\u201d he says: animals in less pain, pets that live longer and Mars, rather than charging for one tooth-extraction appointment, capitalizing on multiple check-ups.\n\nFor similar reasons, Moutault, claims the company is also trying to help overweight pets. \u201cThe owners struggle to see that because they themselves, sometimes, are a little bit overweight, if I may say,\u201d he says. Mars \u201cshould have no interest\u201d in tackling this \u2013 after all, it might sell less food \u2013 but it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lo\u00efc Moutault (right) tours a Mars kibble-production plant.\n\nStaff at its vet clinics are encouraged to have \u201cvery difficult\u201d conversations with pet owners about exercise and portion sizes. Mars is also developing kibble which is lower in calories.\n\nHe also points to the human benefits \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 of owning an animal. \u201cIf I was very cynical,\u201d Moutault suggests, \u201cI would say, \u2018Well, I should ask the government to recognize the fact that we are reducing, actually, healthcare costs for a big part of the human beings who have pets.\u2019\u201d\n\nFew owners of cats and dogs have thought costs were falling in recent years when stocking up on supplies, or counting the zeros on the latest vet bill, however. Are they really getting a fair deal?\n\nMoutault, acknowledges that Mars, a giant in both the pet food and vet care markets, was \u201cvery impacted\u201d by inflation, before pushing back. Pet owners have \u201cway more options than they\u2019ve ever had\u201d, he says, claiming there is a \u201cvery, very large and wide\u201d range of prices around.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vet clinic workers and a patient at the Mars-owned BluePearl emergency hospital in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nToday people are \u201cmore and more willing to actually do more for their pets\u201d, according to Moutault, and there are more and more options available. We are sitting inside a 24-hour pet hospital, with MRI and CT scanners, an intensive care unit, recovery and oxygenated cages, and surgery suites.\n\nDoing more often requires spending more. \u201cObviously some people feel compelled to do whatever it takes. Others are saying, \u2018Well, no, there is a limit to what I can do,\u2019\u201d Moutault says, allowing that this \u201ccreates, potentially, a perception\u201d of rising vet prices.\n\n\u201cSo do they have a fair deal? I think it\u2019s very clear, and we are very clear, that taking a pet is a commitment,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cYou can\u2019t always assume that your pet is going to be healthy.\n\n\u201cAnd trying to develop this consciousness, that you have to kind of anticipate and prepare for that, I think, is an evolution that we want to bring to the pet ownership culture in a way: that you have to anticipate for some of these things happening.\u201d\n\nBig pet goes to great lengths to win over owners, and turn them into reliable customers. A few miles up the road from the hospital, inside a sensory laboratory, a panel of 10 people is tasked with breaking down the smell of certain food samples by considering about 130 different aromatic notes. Is there a whiff of a certain meat, perhaps? Or a specific fruit?\n\nView image in fullscreen Technicians examine kibble under a microscope at the Mars Petcare global innovation center in Thompson\u2019s Station, Tennessee.\n\nSuch samples are examined in forensic detail under microscopes.

In some cases, others would have the point of view that this is going too far.\n\n\u201cIt is their judgment. At the end of the day, the consumer votes.\u201d",

        "title": "Evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Position In The AI Market (NYSE:HPE)",
        "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) split from HP Inc. (HPQ) in 2015, with HP focusing on personal computers and printers and Hewlett Packard Enterprise focusing on business-focused servers, storage, networking, the cloud, software, and various services. HPE benefits from many of the same trends in enterprise computing that had pushed Dell Technologies' (DELL) stock up over 100% earlier this year. In my Dell article, I discussed how investors saw clearer evidence in its last earnings report released on May 30, 2024, that demand for artificial intelligence (\"AI\") enterprise servers could be a huge growth driver for the company moving forward.\n\nThe market recently became more excited by HPE's prospects after it released its second quarter fiscal year (\"FY\") 2024 earnings report on June 4, showing AI systems revenue more than doubled from the first quarter's results. Investors in HPE hope that now that the company's AI initiatives are picking up, its stock performance can achieve a similar performance as Dell's. The stock rose around 11% the day after the company released the report.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe problem is that although the market may give HPE credit for potentially benefiting from AI adoption, its strategy has several risks, including AI servers being less profitable than the traditional server business. Investors should proceed cautiously and not buy this stock purely based on its AI opportunity. Additionally, although several analysts raised its price target post-earnings, the stock price has already exceeded the consensus price target of $20.12.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThis article will discuss HPE's latest AI initiatives and review its latest earnings report. I will also examine the company's valuation and some risks. Last, I will discuss why I believe HPE is a hold.\n\nThe company may be an AI beneficiary\n\nAlthough some people focus on HPE's opportunity to provide AI servers to its customers, it's important to remember that the company is a complete AI solutions provider, meaning it offers services beyond its hardware components. HPE has several other services, including software tools, security solutions, Machine Learning as a Service, consulting, and a hybrid cloud tool builder named GreenLake. Hybrid computing is critical for companies using AI. Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Antonio Neri commented on the hybrid cloud's importance at the Discover 2024:\n\nAI will require hybrid cloud. But AI is not one single thing or a monolithic workload. To deploy AI, you must orchestrate hundreds of microservices, multiple AI models, specific accelerators, and connect many different data sources, all of which are highly distributed across your hybrid IT state. That is why you need a hybrid strategy. At the same time, you must maintain data governance, regulatory compliance, and security end-to-end, making on-premise private clouds essential to your hybrid mix.\n\nAs generative AI proliferates, HPE's hybrid computing solutions, software, and other peripheral services should become more valuable over the long term. Collaborations with partners like Microsoft are also meaningful. When analysts asked Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Marie Myers at the BofA Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference about the partnership with Microsoft, she said, \"HP is helping Microsoft extend the Azure AI platform to customers like OpenAI.\"\n\nManagement also announced at its recent Investor Relations Summit @ HPE Discover 2024 that it was collaborating with NVIDIA (NVDA) on a new venture named Nvidia AI Computing by HPE. This venture addresses three critical components needed for successfully utilizing Generative AI and large language models. NVIDEO CEO said at the conference that the three necessary components are a \"model stack, a data stack, and a computing stack.\"\n\nNVIDIA will contribute a product named NIM as a model stack, which are prebuilt AI models that customers can customize for different tasks. NVIDIA defines NIM as \"inference microservices that provide models as optimized containers \u2014 to deploy on clouds, data centers or workstations, giving them the ability to easily build generative AI applications for copilots, chatbots and more, in minutes rather than weeks.\"\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise will contribute the data stack or the operating system for AI, which provides data processing, vectorization (improves the processing speed of AI algorithms), semantic embedding (captures the meaning of data), and more.\n\nHPE will contribute the computing stack, which includes the servers, storage, and networking required to run power-intensive AI models in collaboration. If successful, this collaboration can potentially drive significant revenue for HPE. HPE also plans to bring along its sales channels and partnerships, including Deloitte, HCL, Infosys (INFY), TCS, and Wipro (WIT).\n\nStill, you might wonder why NVIDIA teamed up with HPE when it already has a collaboration with Dell (I discussed this collaboration in my article on Dell). Well, besides NVIDIA wanting as many outlets to sell AI chips as possible, HPE is one of the premier enterprise server companies and has built some of the world's largest computers with NVIDIA. During HPE Discover, CEO Antonio Neri highlighted several high-profile projects that the two companies collaborated on:\n\nNVIDIA has been our visionary partner who share our purpose and commitment to innovation. Over the years, HPE has partnered with NVIDIA to achieve amazing success with our customers in delivering best-in-class AI and supercomputing solutions. One great example of that is the newest Venado supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which is the first U.S. supercomputer to feature the NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs. Another example is our recently signed $200 million deal to build a new supercomputer for one of Japan's largest research institutions, AIST, which we will build in collaboration with NVIDIA using our HPE Cray XD systems, featuring NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThe second and third points in the above image mention green computing and liquid cooling. During my first article on Super Micro Computer (SMCI), I discussed how that company took market share from Dell and HPE. Supermicro actively promotes \"Green Computing\" on its website, and part of that focus is its liquid cooling solutions. In my Supermicro article, I quoted its CEO Charles Liang, who said (emphasis added), \"Our high-power efficiency systems, free-air and liquid-cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success.\" However, Supermicro's edge over its competitors may be more in terms of being the first to actively promote liquid cooling solutions for servers because HPE has had liquid cooling technology for a while now.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nIn the past, liquid cooling may have been less widespread for servers because they can be expensive to install and often require a significant upfront investment. With lower power chips used in traditional servers, air cooling was sufficient. However, with the usage of increasingly higher-powered chips to run generative AI algorithms, liquid cooling is a requirement for AI servers in data centers. Now that HPE emphasizes selling AI servers, management is talking much more about liquid cooling technology. For instance, CEO Neri said on the Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call:\n\nAs accelerated computing, silicon innovation advances, higher power density demands direct liquid cooling technologies building direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well-positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs.\n\nCFO Marie Myers also commented on the company's liquid cooling prowess at the BofA Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference:\n\nLiquid cooling is a skill that HPE has had for decades. And it goes back to the original sort of acquisitions that we did in some of the heavy compute space. And those decades of experience are now going to be very, very beneficial to customers that we talked about like Microsoft. But moreover, as the chips come on board with [NVIDIA AI chip] Blackwell, maybe it's not quite understood that they're going to be completely in need of liquid cooling. And I think that's where HPE has more than 300 patents and decades of experience.\n\nHPE management likely made those statements to emphasize to investors and potential customers that Supermicro is not the only one with liquid cooling technology. Selling AI solutions could provide a nice tailwind for HPE's revenue and free cash flow growth prospects over the next several years. Let's examine the company's second-quarter results and discover how much of an impact AI has had so far.\n\nHPE second quarter FY 2024 Earnings Results\n\nHPE's second-quarter results showed a significant change from the first quarter when the company showed poor conversion of AI server orders into sales. CEO Neri said the following about the poor first-quarter performance in the company first quarter FY 2024 earnings call:\n\nAI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU [AI chip] availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems.\n\nIn other words, HPE couldn't obtain enough AI chips from suppliers (likely NVIDIA), and customers were not ready to receive the servers because the customer's data centers had failed to complete the set-up of the auxiliary equipment needed to run the servers.\n\nThe company displayed much better results in the second quarter. AI systems orders reached $4.6 billion this quarter, showing strong demand for its AI systems. The big difference is that the company converted more of those orders into sales, which grew from around $400 million to over $900 million sequentially. Management attributed the improvement to an improved supply of AI chips.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nCEO Neri said on the second quarter call (emphasis added):\n\nOur lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between six and 12 weeks, depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year.\n\nIn Dell's last reported quarter, the company indicated the traditional enterprise server market was strong, boosted by high demand for AI servers. Dell's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said on the company's first quarter FY 2025 earnings call, \"We've seen an expansion in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions, which remains a significant opportunity for us given we are in the early stages of AI adoption.\" Dell's first fiscal quarter ended on May 3. HPE CEO Neri said a similar thing on its second-quarter FY 2024 earnings call (HPE's fiscal second quarter ended April 30):\n\nEnterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with the number of Enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe image below shows that the server business is the one area showing positive double-digit revenue growth at 18% year-over-year. HPEFS on the image stands for HPE Financial Services, the company's financing arm. The two pieces of good news in the segment results are that the company's largest segment, the Server segment, is also the fastest growing. The second piece of good news is that the Intelligent Edge and Hybrid Cloud segments are in cyclical downturns, are bottoming, and once those areas return to growth, those segments should further boost the company's overall results. I will discuss HPE's other segments in future articles.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThe company's second quarter FY 2024 net revenue of $7.2 billion exceeded the midpoint of company revenue guidance and beat analysts' consensus revenue by $372.61 million.\n\nMargins are a potential issue as we move down the income statement. In the second quarter, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) shrank by 310 basis points to 33.1%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year. CFO Marie Myers said on the earnings call that the gross margin decline was \"driven by a mix shift from our higher margin Intelligent Edge revenue to Server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud.\"\n\nSince the Server segment is the fastest-growing segment, investors should pay attention to this segment's operating margins in future quarters. The CFO noted during the earnings call that \"pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems,\" which means that although there is heavy demand for AI, there is a potential price war for AI servers between Dell, Supermicro, HPE, and other AI server manufacturers.\n\nCash Flow from operations (\"CFO\") to sales is up to 19.51%. This metric shows how efficiently a company can convert sales into cash flow. HPE is significantly better than its peers at converting sales into cash flow. Another positive sign is that its CFO-to-Sales metric is trending up, a potential positive sign for FCF growth.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nCFO said the following about second quarter FCF on the earnings call:\n\nWe generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal 2024, given higher than expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments.\n\nHPE ended the second quarter with $2.67 billion in cash and equivalents against $7.49 billion of long-term debt. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.52, meaning it has approximately half the liabilities as it has equity. The company has a net debt of $9.252 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of $4.893 billion. Therefore, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the second quarter was 1.89. Generally, a company with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than three has a lower risk of defaulting on its debt. It has an interest coverage ratio of 3.4, meaning its EBIT covers its interest payments by an adequate amount.\n\nThe following guidance raised full-year FY 2024 revenue guidance from 0-2% to 1-3% growth. CFO Marie Myers said on the second quarter earnings call, \"We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake.\" However, the company lowered GAAP operating profit growth from 7-11% to 2-6%\u2014ouch.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThis earnings report displayed mixed results. On the favorable side, the proliferation of AI should boost revenue growth. On the unfavorable side, the first-quarter and second-quarter earnings reports brought up several risks.\n\nRisks\n\nAlthough sales of AI systems should boost revenue growth, they could hurt margins. Some analysts worry that sales of AI servers might be less profitable in the long term than initially thought for companies like HPE, Dell, and Supermicro, as AI chip suppliers like NVIDIA charge higher prices for their chips and squeeze server manufacturers' margins. HPE may ultimately only produce meaningful margins on the software and other services it provides outside the AI servers.\n\nAdditionally, the server industry is commodity-like with little to no moat, meaning that no one company can differentiate itself for a meaningful period and often competes based on price. Also, Dell is an early leader in AI servers. HPE's AI systems backlog of $3.1 billion is softer than Dell's last reported backlog of $3.8 billion. There is some uncertainty about HPE's strategy to catch up. Since Supermicro and Dell are early leaders in providing AI servers, HPE may eventually decide to compete on price, worsening margins.\n\nDell emphasized using NVIDIA chips almost exclusively in the past, while HPE has used many chips that compete with NVIDIA. So, some analysts think that NVIDIA favors Dell over HPE, a potential reason that Dell had enough chips from NVIDIA to satisfy demand in the same quarter (HPE's first quarter 2024) that HPE had difficulty obtaining enough AI chip supply from NVIDIA to meet its end demand. Some fear that each time NVIDIA brings a new chip to market, it might reward Dell's loyalty by providing it with the new chip before HPE. Suppose that scenario occurs; HPE may have a more challenging time competing, as server customers factor in that they can obtain the latest NVIDIA chips faster from Dell.\n\nValuation\n\nHPE has a price-to-FCF of 9.30, below its three- and five-year median, suggesting an undervalued stock.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nHPE sells at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.25, well below Dell's P/E ratio of 27.81. Still, the difference between the valuations may be justified on a P/E basis due to Dell growing its earnings-per-share (\"EPS\") 67% year-over-year while HPE declined 25%.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe following image shows HPE's forward P/E and year-over-year annual EPS growth estimates from FY 2024 to FY 2026. By FY 2025, the company's Intelligent Edge and Hybrid Cloud business should be out of its cyclical downturn, so let's compare the company's FY 2025 EPS growth estimate of 9.86% to its forward P/E of 10.04. Since the forward EPS growth rate and forward P/E nearly match, HPE is trading at fair value at the closing stock price of $20.92 on June 26, 2024.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe following chart shows HPE's shareholder yield, which is the company's capital return via dividends, net share buybacks, and debt reduction. Generally, the market overvalues a stock when the shareholder yield is low and undervalues it when it is high. The company's shareholder yield of 5.77% is closer to the overvalued side than undervalued.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSeeking Alpha's Quant rates the stock's valuation a C.\n\nHPE is a Hold\n\nAlthough HPE will likely benefit from AI adoption, the market has likely priced in that potential upside. That may be why the stock barely budged after announcing its collaboration with NVIDIA at HPE Discover 2024. Considering the company's risks and the fact that other technology investments may benefit more from increasing generative AI adoption, investors may want to avoid this stock at its current price. Put this stock on a watch list and consider buying it if its shareholder yield rises above 10%. I rate HPE a Hold.",

        "title": "Prices Decline In May, Monetary Policy Tightens",
        "body": "Fokusiert\n\nThe United States experienced a mild deflation in May, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI), which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of -0.1 percent in May 2024, down from 3.2 percent in the prior month. The PCEPI has grown 2.5 percent over the last year and 3.8 percent per year since January 2020, just prior to the pandemic. Prices today are 8.9 percentage points higher than they would have been had the Fed hit its 2-percent inflation target over the period.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has also declined. Core PCEPI grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of 1.0 percent in May 2024, down from 3.1 percent in April and 4.0 percent in March. Core PCEPI has grown 2.5 percent over the last year and 3.6 percent per year since January 2020.\n\nFigure 1. Headline and Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index with 2-percent Trend, January 2020 \u2013 May 2024\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested the federal funds rate target range would need to remain at 5.25 to 5.5 percent for longer than had previously been thought. The median FOMC member projected just one 25-basis point rate cut this year, down from three projected back in March. Eight members projected two cuts. Seven members projected one cut. Four members projected zero cuts.\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of FOMC members\u2019 projections of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation numbers bolster the case for lowering the federal funds rate target. As inflation declines, the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate target increases. To prevent the real interest rate from rising, and monetary policy from tightening even further, the FOMC must lower its nominal federal funds rate target.\n\nA numerical example serves to illustrate. Recall that i = r + E(\u1d28), where i is the nominal federal funds rate target, r is the real federal funds rate target, and E(\u1d28) is expected inflation. Suppose one uses the prior month\u2019s core PCEPI inflation reading as a proxy for E(\u1d28). With core inflation at 3.1 percent, as it was two months ago, the Fed\u2019s nominal target range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent implies a real target range of 2.15 to 2.4 percent. With core inflation at just 1.0 percent, as it was last month, the implied real target range is 4.25 to 4.5 percent. The FOMC would need to cut its nominal federal funds rate target by 2.1 percentage points just to leave the real target range unchanged.\n\nWhile illustrative, the numerical example admittedly oversimplifies the problem. The FOMC doesn\u2019t really know how much inflation expectations have declined, nor how much it would need to adjust its nominal federal funds rate target range to prevent the real target range from rising. Still, the direction of the change required by the numerical example seems correct. When the FOMC set the current target range in July 2023, the PCEPI was growing 3.3 percent year-on-year. Core PCEPI was growing 4.1 percent. Both of those rates have since declined to 2.5 percent. Inflation is 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points lower, but the federal funds rate target range is unchanged.\n\nOf course, what ultimately matters for judging the stance of monetary policy is not the level of the real federal funds rate but rather the difference between the real federal funds rate and the so-called natural rate, r*. If r > r*, monetary policy is tight. If r = r*, monetary policy is neutral. If r < r*, monetary policy is loose.\n\nWe do not observe r*, but the New York Fed estimates it was 0.83 to 1.34 in 2023:Q2. In 2024:Q1, the latest quarter for which data is available, it was estimated at 0.7 to 1.18. Hence, the natural rate of interest is thought to have declined 0.13 to 0.16 percentage points in the time since the FOMC set its current target range, which - on its own - would increase the spread between the real federal funds rate and the corresponding natural rate, thereby tightening policy.\n\nFalling inflation likely means that the implied real federal funds rate target range has increased over the last eleven months. Estimates of the natural rate have also declined. Together, lower inflation and a lower natural rate of interest imply that the spread between the natural rate and the implied real federal funds rate target has grown. In other words, monetary policy has gotten tightener. Given the progress made on inflation and the current stance of monetary policy, it makes sense for the Fed to begin cutting its federal funds rate target. It must return policy to neutral, to avoid putting the economy in reverse.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

        "title": "XOMA Corporation: A Hold Rating With Steady Income From Preferred Shares (NASDAQ:XOMA)",
        "body": "iQoncept\n\nXOMA Corporation (NASDAQ:XOMA) operates as a biotechnology royalty aggregator, acquiring economic rights to milestones and royalties from partnered approved or clinical-stage drugs. The company\u2019s diverse IP across various development phases mitigates these risks. Some of the company\u2019s notable IP generates royalties from Roche\u2019s Faricimab for diabetic macular edema and age-related macular degeneration, Dsuvia from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals for acute pain, Ixinity from Medexus for hemophilia B, Xaciato from Organon for bacterial vaginosis, and Ojemda from Day One for pediatric low-grade glioma. Also, its recent acquisition of Kinnate Biopharma (KNTE) extended its IP portfolio into oncology. Nevertheless, while I think XOMA\u2019s business is viable for the foreseeable future, I\u2019m not sure the stock has the same explosive upside potential as other biotechs. Therefore, I deem XOMA a \u201chold,\u201d but its preferred shares (NASDAQ:XOMAP) could fit well into to a diversified dividend portfolio.\n\nDiversified IP: Business Overview\n\nXOMA is a biotechnology royalty aggregator founded in 1981 and based in Emeryville, California. XOMA\u2019s business model involves acquiring the rights of drug candidates to receive future payments after achieving milestones or obtaining royalty rates based on sales if the drugs are approved and launched commercially. You can think of XOMA as an \u201cinvestment manager\u201d of biotech IP rather than a typical biotech company with in-house R&D. XOMA funds biotech companies to advance their pipelines in a diverse portfolio that spans multiple therapeutic areas such as oncology, immunology, rare diseases, and acute pain. The pharmaceutical industry is inherently risky due to the high level of uncertainty about the success of its drug candidates.\n\nCurrently, XOMA\u2019s portfolio has over 70 assets. It includes several commercial and investigational drugs from various biotechnology firms spanning multiple phases of clinical trials. The key partners include large and smaller biotech companies and cover areas such as oncology, immunology, rare diseases, and acute pain.\n\nSource: Corporate Presentation. May 2024.\n\nFor instance, XOMA receives royalties from Roche\u2019s Faricimab, a drug indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema [DME] and age-related macular degeneration [AMD]. The royalty rate is 0.5% of the sales. In addition, XOMA\u2019s portfolio has several other FDA-approved drugs, such as Alora\u2019s Dsuvia, indicated for acute pain; Medexus\u2019s Ixinity for hemophilia B; Organon\u2019s Xaciato for bacterial vaginosis; and Day One\u2019s Ojemda for relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade [pLGG].\n\nAlso, XOMA has royalty rights to Rezolute\u2019s RZ358 and other late-stage investigational drugs that could reach FDA approvals and generate additional revenues. For instance, RZ358 is a drug candidate indicated for congenital hyperinsulinism [CHI] currently enrolling patients for phase 3 clinical trials. If approved, this drug could provide XOMA with approximately 8% to 15% of net sales.\n\nAkin to a Biotech Investment Manager\n\nAs previously noted, pharmaceuticals are inherently risky due to the uncertainty related to investigational drugs. However, XOMA\u2019s diversified approach to IP can theoretically reduce this risk by spreading its exposure across diverse medical fields and development phases. Therefore, the failure of a single investigational drug has a less negative impact, but its upside is also reduced if they\u2019re successful. The underlying benefit is that XOMA\u2019s managers know how to pick winners and losers among biotech IP, focusing on drugs with promising clinical results to reduce the possibility of loss. This is essentially the same as an active investment manager in biotech IP.\n\nSource: Corporate Presentation. May 2024.\n\nThe idea is that XOMA can focus on acquiring rights to early-to-mid-stage clinical drugs, making transactions between $25.0 million and $100.0 million. This segment is different, as big pharma typically focuses on larger M&A transactions and assets in phase 3 or commercial stages. XOMA differentiates by addressing different segments of the market, capitalizing on early development assets that are riskier but also present high-reward prospects.\n\nLatest IP Portfolio Developments\n\nIn April 2024, XOMA acquired Kinnate Biopharma Inc (KNTE) for approximately $120.0 million, including cash payment and estimated future payments from the CVR. This acquisition permits XOMA to grow its portfolio with KNTE\u2019s oncology programs and benefits from future royalty and milestone revenues related to these assets. Using the CVR mechanism ensures that KNTE also benefits from the cash payout and future income from its assets. Should XOMA sell any of KNTE\u2019s programs up to a year post-merger, 85% of the net proceeds will be allocated to CVR holders.\n\nUnfortunately, KITE sold exarafenib and other assets to Pierre Fabre Laboratories before the acquisition, executed in March 2024. So, these gains are 100% distributed to the CVR holders. Exarafenib was KITE\u2019s crown jewel IP to maintain a manageable transaction, but I imagine XOMA accepted KNTE selling it before the acquisition. This means that XOMA\u2019s bet on KITE is mostly focused on the rest of KNTE\u2019s IP, potentially promising in oncology but still mostly pre-clinical.\n\nSource: Corporate Presentation. May 2024.\n\nSince the acquisition, KNTE has operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of XOMA, continuing to advance its pipeline. The investigational programs not sold to Pierre Fabre Laboratories include a c-MET inhibitor implicated in various cancers that have become unsusceptible to other treatments and a brain-penetrant CDK4 Selective Program that stops the overactivation of CDK4, leading to uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation in cancers. This drug crosses the blood-brain barrier [BBB] to overcome resistance in challenging cases. These preclinical drugs offer potential solutions for treating cancer resistance to other medicines. This last acquisition is part of XOMA\u2019s efforts to expand its portfolio and provide a diversified income stream from approved and clinical-stage drugs.\n\nUnattractive Equity: Valuation Analysis\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, XOMA\u2019s equity trades at a $266.5 million market cap. Its balance sheet holds $136.2 million in cash and equivalents plus $9.8 million in short-term royalty receivables. I think it\u2019s sensible to add these two figures to estimate the company\u2019s available short-term liquidity of $146.0 million. However, XOMA also holds $150.7 million in financial debt and makes roughly $3.5 million in quarterly interest payments.\n\nI estimate XOMA\u2019s latest quarterly cash burn was roughly $13.6 million. I obtained this figure by adding the company\u2019s CFOs, CFIs, and preferred dividends. I think this is the correct cash burn approach because the company\u2019s IP-related transactions are essentially CAPEX, and the payments to the preferred shares also result in cash outflows. This figure implies that XOMA\u2019s cash runway is approximately 10.0 years, which is quite healthy.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha.\n\nMoreover, according to Seeking Alpha\u2019s dashboard on XOMA, the company\u2019s revenues will probably pick up in the near term. XOMA is forecasted to generate roughly $26.9 million in revenues by 2025, a 28.2% increase compared to 2024. Most of this growth will likely stem from Ojemda\u2019s recent FDA approval in April 2024 and its future commercialization. XOMA received $9.0 from this milestone and owns mid-single digit royalties on its sales, estimated at $500.0 million to $600.0 million in peak sales. Therefore, I think XOMA\u2019s long-term viability seems secure for the foreseeable future based on these future cash flows, the diversity and potential of its IP portfolio, and its long cash runway.\n\nNevertheless, while I think XOMA\u2019s business is viable for the foreseeable future, I\u2019m not sure the stock has the same explosive upside potential as other biotechs. As you might imagine, diversification mitigates risks and somewhat caps the upside. Since XOMA often doesn\u2019t wholly own the royalty rights to its IP, big wins such as Ojemda don\u2019t translate into huge revenue streams for XOMA.\n\nMoreover, the company doesn\u2019t have direct control over the progress of its IP along FDA regulatory pathways because it\u2019s often licensed to some other entity. Hence, unlike other biotech companies, XOMA isn\u2019t potentially a few trials away from unlocking billions in revenue for shareholders. Instead, the company\u2019s goal seems to remain in business with predictable cashflows to meet its obligations.\n\nSource: TradingView.\n\nUltimately, the company\u2019s forward P/S multiple is self-evidently high at 9.9. For context, XOMA\u2019s sector\u2019s median forward P/S is 3.5, so the stock equity seems somewhat pricy relative to peers. This is why I lean neutral on its equity. While its diverse portfolio is promising, and its business seems safe, its current valuation and ongoing cash burn don\u2019t leave much room for upside or value accumulation.\n\nPrefer the Preferreds: Risk Analysis\n\nI don\u2019t discount the unlikely possibility of a single IP becoming a homerun for XOMA, but from an investment perspective, we shouldn\u2019t make that our base case. I\u2019m neutral and rate the stock itself a \u201chold.\u201d However, I believe that XOMA\u2019s business is viable for the consistent payments to its debt and preferred shareholders. In that sense, the preferred shares might be a better alternative for investors, but as previously noted, they\u2019re more of a dividend play than biotech itself. The preferred shares (XOMAP) yield roughly 8.5%, which is attractive for income investors. The company\u2019s financials and future revenues with Ojemda suggest the yield is sustainable for those looking to diversify into biotech.\n\nXOMAP\u2019s dividend yield. Source: Seeking Alpha.\n\nOn the downside, it\u2019s important to remember that XOMA\u2019s revenue streams are diversified but could become somewhat concentrated over time. Since regulatory risks are inherent in biotech, a single negative FDA decision regarding an already approved IP could be devastating for income investors. But overall, I don\u2019t think such a scenario is highly likely, making XOMAP a fine addition to a diversified dividend portfolio.\n\nXOMAP over XOMA: Conclusion\n\nOn balance, XOMA\u2019s business model is intriguing. On its face, I compare it to an investment manager of biotech patents and IP. This yields a relatively steady diversified set of revenue streams with some speculative potential inherent in biotech. However, while this approach mitigates downside risk, it also caps its upside potential. XOMA\u2019s valuation and ongoing cash burn make it unattractive since it doesn\u2019t hold the same explosive upside potential as regular biotech stocks. However, this business model seems appropriate for investors looking into steady dividend income via the preferred shares (XOMAP). Hence, I rate XOMA a \u201chold,\u201d but I think XOMAP could be a fine addition to a diversified dividend portfolio at these levels.",
        "summary": "Also, its recent acquisition of Kinnate Biopharma (KNTE) extended its IP portfolio into oncology.\nTherefore, I deem XOMA a \u201chold,\u201d but its preferred shares (NASDAQ:XOMAP) could fit well into to a diversified dividend portfolio.\nYou can think of XOMA as an \u201cinvestment manager\u201d of biotech IP rather than a typical biotech company with in-house R&D.\nThis is essentially the same as an active investment manager in biotech IP.\nThis figure implies that XOMA\u2019s cash runway is approximately 10.0 years, which is quite healthy.",

The 160 yen level of course is a large round psychologically significant figure and an area that I think a lot of people are going to pay attention to it. Market memory comes into picture, and we could see buyers there, but even if we pull back from there, the market I think has plenty of support near the 158 yen level, possibly even the 155 yen level.\n\nAll things being equal, this is a market that I do think continues to go higher, but we are a little stretched, so don\u2019t be surprised with a little bit of a give back. That give back should be thought of as a buying opportunity due to the fact that the interest rate differential will continue to be quite wide between the two central banks. Remember, Japan really can\u2019t do anything with its monetary policy at the moment, while the Federal Reserve, looks very likely to hang out at this level.\n\nSo, with that being said, I think you\u2019ve got a situation where you continue to buy dips. And I do think that given enough time, we continue to see the Japanese yen lose strength against most currencies, not just the green bank, but with interest rates high in the United States.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The latest social-media frivolity this week from the man known as Roaring Kitty sent traders frantically reading into a cartoon featuring, of all things, a dog.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWas Keith Gill getting into WOOF? (Petco Health & Wellness Co.) Perhaps PET? (Wag! Group Co.) Or, quite possibly, the company that was co-founded by Ryan Cohen, GameStop Corp.\u2019s current chief executive, CHWY? (Chewy Inc.)\n\nHis legions of retail traders \u2014 tracking @TheRoaringKitty on X and u/DeepF\u2014\u2014ingValue on Reddit \u2014 didn\u2019t wait to find out. Each stock jumped by at least 12% after the dog post, triggering trading halts that in pre-meme years were usually reserved for merger news or management changes.\n\nMuch like when Gill renewed a bout of GameStop fever with a photo of a gamer leaning in with his controller, the episode has longtime market observers on edge about the influence of a retail-trading ringleader with the power to bend markets, for potentially their own personal gain. It\u2019s one thing when there\u2019s obvious falsehoods or misrepresentations, but how, they wonder, could authorities ever fault someone for what Redditors or bots read into a meme?\n\nOr, to put it bluntly: Who does this guy \u2014 and the traders who track him \u2014 think he is, exactly?\n\n\u201cCrypto folks are probably laughing at the equity market. Someone posts a picture of a dog, and stocks rip,\u201d said Joseph Saluzzi, partner and co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. \u201cWe talk about how bad the crypto market is \u2014 just unregulated craziness \u2014 but here we are.\u201d\n\nNow concern is rising that this year\u2019s meme frenzy will end badly for the amateur crowd, once again. While Gill has long made a fundamental case for GameStop, it\u2019s less clear how to interpret his potential foray into pet companies.\n\nRicher Memelord\n\nSure, Elon Musk, a fellow memelord, can sway the price of dogecoin with a mere mention on Saturday Night Live, or roil shares of Tesla Inc. by putting up a poll about selling a chunk of his stake. But with a fortune in excess of $200 billion, and with a handful of interconnected companies in his control, he has the financial might to shift markets.\n\nGill though? He earned a CFA charter and was previously employed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., in effectively an unremarkable office job. Yet, in the meme-stock era he helped usher in, he\u2019s built up a sizeable fortune by all accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest market moves suggest at least some Roaring Kitty fatigue is kicking in. Petco shares closed little changed on Thursday, and ended the week just 6.8% higher than where they started. Wag! Group, after at one point on Thursday notching its biggest daily gain in 10 months, fell 4.2% on Friday. Chewy, which nearly hit a one-year high on Tuesday, closed out the week by falling 6.2%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear his impact is becoming shorter- and shorter-lived with Chewy down since the dog meme from yesterday,\u201d said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. \u201cThe more the trading community sees the Roaring Kitty story play out (tweet, stock spike, stock crash), the shorter the time frame becomes for each interaction.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which the pet-related shares rallied \u2014 and then reversed \u2014 raises questions about the traders who are heeding Gill\u2019s purported populist call more than three years ago. Back then, he and a group of Redditors famously wreaked havoc on short-selling hedge funds and provided a windfall for the retail crowd.\n\nThat celebration didn\u2019t last long. When the risk-on spirits took a U-turn in 2022, amateur traders gave back all of the meme-era gains within months, Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis at a time showed.\n\n\u201cIf hedge funds aggressively short Chewy, GameStop and other meme stocks, you\u2019re essentially trading against an 800 pound gorilla,\u201d said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser at Wealthspire Advisors. \u201cIf you\u2019re betting on this with your retirement money, I\u2019ll say a prayer for you and wish you well.\u201d\n\nThe fact that there\u2019s appetite to ride volatile meme stocks has caught some onlookers by surprise, given the different economic backdrop from its original fervor in 2021. The pandemic excess savings buffer is depleted and then some, helping drive a decline in consumer firepower.\n\nBut, at least in the US market, there appears to be plenty of ammunition to lift broad indexes \u2014 and, at least for a moment, the Roaring Kitty stock of the day.\n\n\u201cThe fervor to speculate is still very much alive,\u201d Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, said on Bloomberg Radio. \u201cPeople are still ready to gamble on the stock market as if the pandemic just hit the shores. It again shows you that there\u2019s a great big willingness to take risk.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo, Carmen Reinicke and Stefani Reynolds.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "SAN DIEGO, June 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers of shares of Teladoc (NYSE: ) Health, Inc. (NYSE: TDOC) stock between November 2, 2022 and February 20, 2024, all dates inclusive (the Class Period), have until Tuesday, July 16, 2024 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Teladoc class action lawsuit. Captioned Stary v. Teladoc Health, Inc., No. 24-cv-03849 (S.D.N.Y.), the Teladoc class action lawsuit charges Teladoc as well as certain of Teladoc's top current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Teladoc class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-teladoc-health-inc-class-action-tdoc.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Teladoc class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 16, 2024.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Teladoc provides online, direct-to-consumer health service services. BetterHelp is Teladoc's largest division and contributes the Company's greatest revenue share, contributing about 42% of overall revenue.\n\nThe Teladoc class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Teladoc continued to expand its marketing spend throughout 2023, despite public assurances that it would pull back its advertising spending; (ii) increased marketing spend on BetterHelp deteriorated Teladoc's revenue, with little return for that investment; (iii) despite Teladoc's acknowledgment that increased advertising spend would be marginally inefficient due to market saturation, it continued to grow its advertising spend in the BetterHelp business; and (iv) despite public statements that there remained a long runway for BetterHelp membership growth, BetterHelp's membership stagnated and then decreased in 2023, due to market saturation, largely due to BetterHelp's own marketing.\n\nThe Teladoc class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 20, 2024, Teladoc released its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings report on Form 10-K, which demonstrated substantially increased advertising costs substantially driven by higher digital and media advertising costs related to BetterHelp. Teladoc also revealed that BetterHelp revenue fell $1 million compared to the year prior and fell about $10 million from the third to the fourth quarter of 2023; that BetterHelp lost members for two consecutive quarters, despite that increased advertising spend; and that Teladoc's revenue was flat compared to the prior year and down 3% sequentially \u201c well below expectation, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of Teladoc's shares fell by more than 23%, according to the Teladoc class action lawsuit.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Teladoc stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Teladoc class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Teladoc class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Teladoc class action lawsuit.

        "title": "4 expert-recommended supplements to boost your energy",
        "body": "The heat wave gripping much of the country can be a serious energy sapper. But so can a slew of other culprits, from lack of sleep and poor diet to depression, anemia, stress, thyroid issues, and even lack of exercise. And sometimes caffeine just doesn\u2019t do the trick (not to mention that drinking too much can cause ill effects from increased heart rate to dizziness and anxiety).\n\nSo what about vitamins and supplements to help boost your energy? There are a few that experts swear by.\n\nBut first, a few caveats.\n\n\u201cIf someone is dealing with low energy, my initial response would be to recommend a series of tests before considering supplements,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth Sharp, internist and medical director at Health Meets Wellness in New York City, tells Fortune. \u201cTesting for vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamin D and vitamin B12, especially in vegetarians, is crucial. Additionally, I would screen for thyroid disorders if other symptoms suggest such a condition, and I would also rule out anemia and iron deficiency. It\u2019s important to identify the underlying cause accurately to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.\u201d\n\nOnce they are determined to be appropriate, she says, be cautious when making your purchase. \u201cBe wary of supplements that are far cheaper than the rest or look like a good deal,\u201d Jolene Brighten, naturopathic endocrinologist and author of Is This Normal?, warns. \u201cOften these are using poor quality ingredients and in some cases, because they are not regulated, they won\u2019t actually have what the label lists.\u201d\n\nTo help avoid such risks, suggests Cathi Dennehy, a doctor of pharmacy, dietary supplement researcher, and professor at the University of California San Francisco, start by speaking with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian who is well-versed in supplements. Then, when you\u2019re ready to buy, be sure to do some research, especially on the brand.\n\nConsumers may want to consult the National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements] as well as subscription-based sources, such as Consumer Lab, which charges a fee for access to its test results, which looks into everything from possible contaminants to making sure a supplement contains what it claims to. \u201cA question that I get asked fairly frequently is, \u2018Is this brand that I\u2019m taking a good brand?\u2019\u201d says Dennehy, who points to these sources for answers.\n\nFinally, she says, when deciding which vitamins and supplements could help with energy: \u201cThis is my take on it: If you\u2019re deficient in it, then correcting can be helpful. But if you\u2019re not deficient in it, then it\u2019s not likely to be helpful.\u201d\n\nAll of that said, below are four favorites to consider.\n\n1. Vitamin B12\n\nA nutrient that helps keep our body\u2019s blood and nerve cells healthy and while also helping to make DNA, the genetic material in all of our cells, vitamin B12 also helps prevent megaloblastic anemia, a blood condition that makes people tired and weak, according to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. It\u2019s why it\u2019s often a solid go-to for people lacking energy, as long as there\u2019s evidence of a deficiency.\n\n\u201cThere are certain vitamins that we know to be more likely to be associated with deficiency in the general population. And about 15% of the population is deficient in B-12. So that\u2019s something that you could test for,\u201d says Dennehy. She adds that certain populations are more likely to be deficient\u2014including vegans, because B-12 is bound to animal protein in food; folks with an autoimmune disorder called pernicious anemia, who are unable to absorb the vitamin; and people who take a lot of over-the-counter stomach-acid reducers, like famotidine, because they don\u2019t have the stomach acid to release the B-12 from the animal protein.\n\nBut, warns Brighten, \u201cBe cautious taking these in the late afternoon or evening since they can interfere with sleep in some people.\u201d\n\nAnd, once again, says Dennehy, \u201cthe only reason it would improve energy would be if you\u2019re correcting a deficiency.\u201d\n\n2. Vitamin D\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, some of the top symptoms of vitamin D deficiency in adults are fatigue, muscle weakness and low mood, which can lead to feeling down and exhausted. So does it make sense that supplementing the vitamin could add some pep in your step?\n\nPossibly. A study published in the journal Medicine compared the results of two groups with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency\u2014one of which was given vitamin D supplements, the other a placebo. In just four weeks, the group given vitamin D experienced significant improvements in energy levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get the vitamin D you need from your diet; oily fish and fortified dairy products are the only important sources,\u201d notes a Harvard newsletter on supplements. \u201cSo supplements do make good sense for most adults.\n\n\u201cVitamin D is beneficial during the winter,\u201d says Sharp, \u201cwith 1,000 to 2,000 IU daily being safe for most people.\u201d Brighten adds that \u201cit is also important to be getting enough sunlight,\u201d and suggests testing D levels to determine what you need.\n\n3. Creatine\n\nCreatine is a compound made in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas\u2014and found naturally in foods such as red meat and fish. It\u2019s primarily stored in your muscles in the form of phosphocreatine, which is \u201cthe initial energy source for all exercise and the preferred source for \u2018explosive\u2019 movements such as lifting heavy objects, jumping, and short sprints. As such, creatine monohydrate supplements are widely used to increase strength performance,\u201d according to the Department of Defense Dietary Supplement Resource.\n\nAnd unlike some other supplements, says Dennehy, \u201cThat one actually has some decent evidence for being beneficial for someone who does, let\u2019s say, high-intensity exercise.\u201d The International Society of Sports Nutrition, she adds, has a favorable stance on creatine, as does the Natural Medicines Database. \u201cIt seems to improve that maximal, intense-exercise output.\u201d So creatine\u2014available in powder, capsule or gummy form\u2014 makes sense, she says, \u201cif you\u2019re someone who\u2019s doing a lot of heavy athletic activity.\u201d\n\nBrighten agrees, noting, \u201cCreatine is a very well studied supplement that offers both brain and muscle health benefits. In addition, it can help your cells generate a molecule called ATP, which is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell. Creatine can help improve your workouts, which can result in you feeling more energetic and getting better sleep.\u201d\n\n4. Iron\n\n\u201cAgain, it would make sense if you\u2019re deficient in iron,\u201d says Dennehy. \u201cAnd like the World Health Organization notes, iron deficiency is common worldwide. About 30% of the world has a more severe form of iron deficiency anemia, and we know iron deficiency anemia can result in tiredness and fatigue and weakness, and decreased immunity. So this is where you would want to have your kind of lab work done.\u201d\n\nBecause excess iron, on the other hand, can be toxic to the body, she says.\n\nBrighten adds, \u201cOutside of patients who are regularly menstruating, pregnant, or who have confirmed iron deficiency anemia, we don\u2019t typically recommend iron supplementation because it can have negative effects on your health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can cause gastrointestinal issues if not needed,\u201d warns Sharp.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nFinally, two bonus supplements to consider include beetroot powder, which Brighten says \u201cis rich in nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide, which leads to increased blood flow and delivering oxygen to your tissues, which can result in more energy,\u201d and magnesium. That, she says, \u201cis a mineral that a lot of people benefit from and can help with energy levels by improving sleep. Additionally, magnesium is required for the metabolism of foods, which is how we obtain energy, and in regulating our blood sugar, which helps us maintain energy.\u201d\n\nMore on supplements:",

        "title": "Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz: Ticket company is family member",
        "body": "There are five members of the Hartz household: Julia and her husband Kevin, their two daughters and their $483 million company\u2014Eventbrite.\n\nThe couple launched the business in 2006 alongside their third co-founder\u2014Renaud Visage\u2014with Kevin initially taking on the title of CEO. In 2016 Julia took the reins, just in time to take the company public before she and her team were slammed into the crisis that was the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile Hartz held the top job that fateful March, she told Fortune titles went out the window as the team pulled together to keep the business above water. For Hartz, that meant making some tough decisions on how many staff the company needed to survive\u2014for her husband it meant dropping his full-time job as an investor and working alongside his wife to keep the company on track.\n\nBut four years later the company\u2014built on gathering people in person\u2014has not only survived social distancing and lockdowns, but is flourishing. Indeed, as consumers have rediscovered in-person socializing a new frontier has opened up for Eventbrite: niche hobbies which might even allow visitors to make some romantic connections.\n\nSpeaking to Fortune, Hartz reflected on the \u201cexciting but deeply disturbing\u201d experience of being one of the only female founder-CEOs to have launched her business on the New York Stock Exchange, and how the pandemic forced her to get past any shred imposter syndrome she might have felt.\n\nA dark room with no oxygen\n\nAt first, Hartz told Fortune in a video interview, she judged herself on \u201cAm I doing it right? What would Kevin do?\u201d Then, \u201cthat line of questioning and self-doubt went out the window when COVID happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine getting stuck in a room that has very little oxygen and every single light goes out, to the point it\u2019s an utter void of darkness. That was like the first two weeks of COVID,\u201d recalled Hartz, who has been named on Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women list. \u201cThe entire basis of our business evaporated and no one in their right mind could have predicted that. We do all this scenario planning, disaster planning, tabletop exercises\u2014there never once was a scenario when a global pandemic hits and people aren\u2019t actually allowed to gather in a place like the United States.\n\n\u201cIn order to get out of that room\u2014that dark room\u2014I had to go on instinct completely. I had to do things that rationally I would never ever imagine doing, and I made a bunch of micro mistakes but the things I got right were really critical. Which was to move quickly, to not let it play out and see what happened, and that meant making a lot of tough decisions.\u201d\n\nThat included axing half of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014around 450 people\u2014and hitting the (metaphorical) road to drum up some fresh financing.\n\nWith a massive overhaul came the opportunity to rebuild the company with added experience, so Hartz and her senior executive team drew up a one-page draft of how they wanted the reset to go.\n\n\u201cWe were dividing conquering and I realized after being in a month of crisis mode that I had forgotten to have a moment of doubt. And I was like \u2018Oh, that\u2019s handy I should keep doing this,'\u201d Hartz recalled. \u201cI remember laying on the ground of our home office just thinking \u2018If I live through this I\u2019m never going to waste time feeling a lack of confidence.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile an ideas overhaul reshaped the company, one decisive factor stayed the same: parity. From the offset Eventbrite wanted the company to \u201clook like the world\u201d and to have a 50/50 gender balance, with Hartz describing her cofounders as \u201cincredible feminists.\u201d\n\nAnd that hasn\u2019t changed\u2014in 2018 the the Eventbrite board reached 50/50 parity and in 2024 the idea that you have to \u201csee it to be it\u201d is still core to the business.\n\nHartz explained: \u201cIt\u2019s come about very organically. I think if you have that North Star that guides you to build a company that is treating everyone well, gives everybody a place, and never makes anybody look over their shoulder and think: \u2018Should I be here?\u2019 then you\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nFifth family member\n\nWhile 18 is the age many parents see their kids as grown up and independent, near-two decades in business is no guarantee that its founders can take their eyes off the ball.\n\nFor Hartz\u2019s daughters, Eventbrite has become something of a commercial sibling they grew up alongside, understanding that when their parents needed to focus on the business it has been for their family.\n\nDuring COVID Kevin and Julia were working 20 hours a day, with their home becoming a \u201cvillage\u201d of people who pitched in to help.\n\n\u201cI have these sweet photos Kevin took of our daughters sleeping on the couch in our office. It was reminiscent of when we started the company and they were a part of that journey as well,\u201d Hartz said. \u201cDuring that time the girls would serve us dinner\u2014they\u2019d come in dressed as waiters and do little skits and sing songs. I think they knew that levity was really important. I think there\u2019s something really special about having this company be a member of the family in terms of what we prioritize and I hope that they have really fond memories of it.\u201d\n\nThat \u201csweet intimacy\u201d in a \u201ccold, scary time of unknown\u201d also echoed through to Hartz\u2019s relationship with her husband\u2014not only as a life partner, but as a co-founder.\n\nFor many, a life partner setting up massive gaming-style screens in your home office may not scream charm but for Hartz it was \u201cthe most romantic gesture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just melted because in one gesture he showed me he was going to drop everything and be a co-founder. It didn\u2019t matter what our titles were, we were going to be side by side. We were shoulder to shoulder for a month making some really difficult decisions\u2014when you\u2019re founders it\u2019s not unlike being parents,\u201d Hartz added.\n\nEventbrite\u2019s new era\n\nWith the pandemic in the rearview, Eventbrite\u2014which has recently increased its engineering footprint in India with gender equity throughout its ranks\u2014and its customers alike are focussed on what\u2019s next. For consumers that entails exploring their niche interests and meeting new people, be it friends or romantic interests.\n\nA recent data capture of people using the Eventbrite platform found that dating and singles events were on the rise \u201cmassively\u201d\u2014up three to four-fold. And that doesn\u2019t entail more stereotypical events like speed dating or mixers, it\u2019s happening around activities like classes or hobbies.\n\nIndeed, women in Eventbrite\u2019s survey group said they would prefer to meet someone at a cooking class as opposed to out at a bar.\n\nHartz added: \u201cI find it so sweet and charming when you think about the dynamic of wanting to get outside of this swiping and algorithmic, programmed matching\u2026 to actually being somewhere, doing something you love to do and actually meeting someone through that experience.\u201d\n\nAs well as romantic events, sober get togethers are also rising in popularity\u2014even down to reading groups where people are encouraged not to discuss the book, but simply enjoy their novel in silence.\n\nAnd\u2014in a year of Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and the Euros football tournament\u2014there\u2019s also plenty of fans looking to enjoy events together.\n\n\u201cWe tracked almost 200 Euro viewing parties that already had more sign-ups than the capacity of the first stadium,\u201d Hartz said. \u201c[People were also] doing all sorts of Taylor Swift-themed programming and official non-ticketed events. The vibrancy of events is incredibly high, the creativity is incredibly high, people want to go out and do something that\u2019s unique. That\u2019s propelled by social media, by discovering great events and wanting to share you\u2019ve been somewhere unique that matches your niche interests.\u201d",

        "title": "Hinge CMO on fighting the loneliness crisis and Gen Z's exhaustion with dating apps",
        "body": "A vast majority of Gen Z\u201479%\u2014feel emotionally, mentally, or physically exhausted from using dating apps, according to a survey from Forbes Health this year. \u2018Dating app fatigue\u2019 is a vicious cycle: Hopeful romantics rely on their phones to help them find love, but they\u2019re also burned out by the experience.\n\nThe loneliness epidemic\u2014which technology helped fuel and is also trying to solve\u2014is at the top of Hinge CMO Jackie Jantos\u2019s mind. She recognizes that her core Gen Z audience lacks authentic connections but knows they define community as engaging in person with people with similar interests and values. She is focusing the marketing effort on pushing users toward connection and investing in solving the loneliness epidemic through social impact outside of the app itself.\n\n\u201cWe know that you can\u2019t date well if you\u2019re not feeling well, so we started digging into what was happening there,\u201d she says.\n\nFortune virtually sat down with Jantos to learn more about Hinge\u2019s \u201cOne More Hour\u201d initiative and the app\u2019s role in addressing the loneliness epidemic.\n\nThe interview has been edited for clarity when necessary.\n\nFortune: What is your research and data showing us about dating, loneliness, and Gen Z today?\n\nJackie Jantos: Our research found that over 80% of Gen Z feel lonely. There are a variety of places they turn when they\u2019re feeling this way, from social media to online entertainment. And in reality, they are spending 1,000 fewer hours in person.\n\nFor us, the focus is on how we bring people together and encourage them to return to in-person connections. What are the ways that we can support the social groups and organizations that are trying to do that work? And how do we combat some of the barriers that are holding people back from in-person gatherings?\n\nFortune: And how are you doing this?\n\nJantos: Our organization and app are very focused on getting people off the app and into real dates. We actually measure great dates, and it\u2019s the core metric that we look at. Getting people to connect in person is really critical to building relationships and to the work that we\u2019re always trying to do.\n\nFortune: With Gen Z as your core audience, how do you ensure Hinge is not contributing to their loneliness\u2014or serving as another barrier to in-person connection?\n\nJantos: Hinge as an app is very different from others. It\u2019s much more focused on slow onboarding and helping you really articulate what you\u2019re looking for at a pace that is more comfortable for you. If you look at some of the recent product work that we\u2019ve put out there, we\u2019ve put out things like \u2018your term limits,\u2019 which is a feature we were testing and launched a couple of weeks ago. The goal is to encourage people to focus on a few great conversations versus sitting on many interactions on the app at any given time.\n\nMost of what we\u2019re doing is trying to help people navigate this experience. We do this by articulating what they\u2019re looking for really clearly, connecting them with relevant matches, and helping them focus on higher-quality conversations with those matches. All that is in service of getting them off the app and into great dates faster.\n\nIf we don\u2019t encourage people to meet in person, they\u2019ll continue to spend more time online than in person. It is not about how often you engage on the app but how seamlessly you get off the app.\n\nFortune: How has your role as CMO changed throughout your time at Hinge?\n\nJantos: When I think about brand marketing, it has historically been about expressing the values of your organization and your brand to the world to encourage people to feel connected to it. Particularly when engaging with the Gen Z audience, the tangible activities of the brand and the business more tangibly connect to their understanding of your brand\u2019s values.\n\nOur social impact work right now is focused not just on romantic relationships but also on helping Gen Z more easily connect in person with each other. We\u2019re really focusing on that social impact activity to bring more energy and conversation around this topic to life.\n\nFortune: What is Hinge\u2019s One More Hour initiative?\n\nJantos: One More Hour is a program that we launched in December, and we launched it with a million-dollar fund that was essentially a call to action, a call to individuals or groups organizing social clubs where people can come together in person and engage in some sort of activity. Affordability is a big part of what we were looking for as well. And this month, we had just over 200 applications for the One More Hour grant. We have awarded an inaugural cohort of 40 social clubs, and so the response has really been overwhelming. We\u2019ve been working with Gen Z organizations and our own Gen Z advisory council to advise us along the way.\n\nFortune: What have you noticed about the evolving nature of dating apps and how people engage with Hinge?\n\nJantos: In the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been growing at an incredible pace with Gen Z. This is an audience that does not mince words when they talk about how they feel about brands, and they\u2019re looking for services that meet their needs. What\u2019s unique about this audience is they are looking for meaningful connections. They\u2019re looking for ways to find that. They\u2019re just at the beginning of being able to recognize the value of connecting in person, and that is the crux of the conversation.\n\nWe\u2019re coming of age in a period when the development of identity and how you connect with one another are critical aspects of growing and understanding what sort of relationships you want to be in and how you want to show up in a relationship.\n\nThere are many ways that brands, particularly brands serving Gen Z, can donate their money, resources, and talent to great causes with organizations that are also trying to serve Gen Z. So, for me, social impact is really critical to growing a sustainable, long-term business and to supporting the audience you\u2019re aiming to serve.\n\nFortune: What do you see as the future of Hinge\u2019s role in the larger loneliness epidemic?\n\nJantos: We know that you can\u2019t date well if you\u2019re not feeling well, so we started digging into what was happening there. A year or so later, the U.S. Surgeon General announced the advisory on the loneliness epidemic, which came as no surprise to us.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to know that people, particularly younger generations, have access to so much information, very openly share their views, and read the views of others.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising to us when we then influence the development of the product itself and launch features like hidden words, which went out quite recently, where you can essentially block words from incoming likes to have a more curated experience on Hinge. Term limits help tighten the quality of matches and conversations happening on hinge.\n\nFortune: Are there any features on the horizon we should look out for?\n\nJantos: We have a lot in the hopper right now that will come out in the second half of this year. So, there is more to come that I can\u2019t speak to right now. But absolutely. Product features in development right now are in accordance with the organization\u2019s values and how we hope to serve this group of young adults better.",

        "body": "Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.\n\nSky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.\n\nCity sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.\n\nMoney blog: How to split housework fairly\n\nThese are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.\n\nAn outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.\n\nOVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.\n\nUnder Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.\n\nOVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.\n\nImage: Stephen Fitzpatrick launched OVO in 2009. Pic: OVO\n\nIn recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.\n\nIn May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.\n\nMr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.\n\nHe is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nFour major banks hit by glitches\n\nExit from recession stronger than first thought\n\nEx-Fujitsu engineer denies 'protecting the monster'\n\nKey to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.\n\nOVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (\u00a3395m) valuation.\n\nKaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.\n\nOVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.\n\nIn 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of \u00a31.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.\n\nIt said this had \"no cash impact\" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nLast summer, the company announced a \u00a3200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.\n\nOther investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.\n\nMayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.\n\nThis weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.\n\nLike its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.\n\nLast month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of \u00a3122, to \u00a31568.\n\nOther big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over \u00a37bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.\n\nCentrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of \u00a37.3bn.\n\nOVO, whose valuation in any major transaction was unclear this weekend, declined to comment.",

        "title": "PG: Earnings Consistency, Strong Momentum Heading Into FY 2025 (NYSE:PG)",
        "body": "RobsonPL/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nConsumer Staples stocks have quietly produced gains so far this quarter, nearly keeping pace with the tech-dominated S&P 500. While there has been an uptick just recently in Consumer Discretionary stocks, namely a fresh high in shares of Amazon (AMZN), many blue-chip Staples continue to trade at premium valuation multiples in the face of a booming broader market. I believe that will generally persist.\n\nI am upgrading The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) from a sell to a hold. I questioned its valuation and pointed out technical risks early last year, but failed to appreciate the durability of the company and its management\u2019s execution. While I do not see the stock as a bargain today, risks appear balanced. Shares have returned 23% since the original analysis compared to a 35% S&P 500 performance.\n\nQTD S&P 500 Sector Performances: Staples Holding Up Well\n\nKoyfin Charts\n\nAccording to Bank of America Global Research, Procter & Gamble, one of the world's largest consumer products companies, operates under five segments: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby & Family Care. Brands include Pampers, Tide, Bounty, Charmin, Gillette, Oral B, Crest, Olay, Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Ariel, Gain, Always, Tampax, Downy, and Dawn.\n\nBack in April, PG reported a mixed set of quarterly results. Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 beat the Wall Street consensus forecast of $1.41 while sales of $20.2 billion, up just 0.6% from year-ago levels, was a $240 million miss. But the company raised its FY 2024 diluted net EPS growth rate from a range of \u20131% to flat to +1% to +2% compared with the previous year\u2019s $5.90 total. Core net EPS growth was also increased to the 10% to 11% range y/y. The firm expects to reward shareholders with more than $9 billion in dividends while it buys back $5 to $6 billion in stock this year.\n\nAfter registering 3% y/y organic revenue growth in Q3, all eyes are on the upcoming quarter which featured a higher US Dollar Index and likely more soft numbers out of China and the Middle East. North America sales may be steady in the low-to-mid single-digit range and another strong showing from Europe, which was +7% in the previous quarter, would be a significant tailwind.\n\nCommodities have been held in check for the most part this year, but any further rise in the price of oil, perhaps toward the $90 mark later this summer, would be a challenge for PG. Ahead of the July 30 Q4 report, the options market has priced in a small 2.2% earnings-related stock price swing when analyzing the at-the-money straddle expiring soonest after the report, according to data from Option Research & Technology Services.\n\nKey risks for the company include weaker-than-expected sales growth in the quarters ahead, potentially due to increased competition from private label brands and a broader market upturn which may result in more cyclical areas of the market outperforming. Furthermore, additional strength in the US dollar would be at least a temporary hit to earnings.\n\nOn earnings, analysts at BofA see operating EPS rising sharply this year with continued robust growth through the out year and 2026. The current Seeking Alpha consensus forecast shows comparable non-GAAP per-share earnings advancement in the coming years while PG\u2019s top line is seen rising at a steady pace between 2.9% and 3.9%.\n\nDividends, meanwhile, are expected to increase from $3.83 this year to potentially above $4.25 by year-end 2026, resulting in a dividend yield that could grow to be more than twice that of the S&P 500. While the company\u2019s free cash flow yield is not extremely high, the firm is executing well after shedding some non-core businesses in recent years.\n\nPG: Earnings, Valuation, Dividend Yield, Free Cash Flow Yield Forecasts\n\nBofA Global Research\n\nOn valuation, PG has historically traded with a significant P/E premium due to its stability even during periods of economic stress. Still, the current earnings multiple is a full turn above its 5-year average. If we assume normalized non-GAAP EPS of $6.70 over the next 12 months, very close to the current consensus, and apply a 5-year average forward P/E, then shares should trade near $164, putting the stock about fairly valued. PG shares are also modestly expensive on a price-to-sales basis.\n\nPG: Shares Trade Near the Historic P/E, Slightly Elevated P/S\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nCompared to its peers, PG features a weak valuation rating, but that is common among the steadiest large-cap Staples stocks. With a lukewarm growth trajectory, PG\u2019s profitability metrics are about the best you\u2019ll find across the sector. What\u2019s more, PG has topped EPS estimates time and again, leading to strong sellside EPS revisions over the past 90 days. Finally, share-price momentum continues to run strong with the stock near all-time highs.\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLooking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed Q4 2024 earnings date of Tuesday, July 30 BMO with a conference call immediately after the numbers hit the tape. You can listen live here. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.\n\nCorporate Event Risk Calendar\n\nWall Street Horizon\n\nThe Technical Take\n\nI was bearish on PG early last year at precisely the wrong time. Mea culpa. Shares had been consolidating after moving lower from a January 2023 peak near $155. Despite a dip under the 200-day moving average, the bulls took charge and a broad uptrend was underway. Jump ahead to today, and the stock is very close to all-time highs, rising above the January 2022 previous peak above $165. Moreover, the 200dma remains upward-sloping, suggesting that the bulls control the primary trend.\n\nI am mildly concerned that shares are not moving decisively above the previous all-time high amid negative RSI divergence. Still, given a previous range between $141 and $158, there is a near-term upside target to $175 based on the $17 height of that past range. I see current support at the 200dma around $156 and the Q2 low of $153.52. Finally, there is now a high amount of volume by price from $165 down to $140 given the congestion zone over the past few years, which should offer cushion on any significant downside moves.\n\nOverall, PG\u2019s chart is healthy with shares hovering near all-time highs.\n\nPG: Bullish Advance to All-Time Highs\n\nStockcharts.com\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI am upgrading PG from a sell to a hold. I was too bearish on the valuation last year while bulls defended the stock during an early 2023 pullback. Going forward, solid sales growth, strong margins, and stabilizing commodity prices should be supportive of future earnings increases.",

        "title": "How To Invest $100,000 For Big Dividends From 3 Big Macro Trends",
        "body": "DNY59\n\nDividend investing can be quite challenging in the rapidly changing world in which we find ourselves. Many times, dividend investors may focus on dividend kings and aristocrats (NOBL) with the thought that since their business models have been able to support dividend growth every year for 25 to 50 or more years without any interruptions, they are likely to continue doing so for years to come. While this principle generally holds, there are still some glaring exceptions, as evidenced by recent massive failures by various dividend kings and aristocrats such as Leggett & Platt (LEG), 3M (MMM), AT&T (T), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and even WP Carey (WPC). As a result, simply buying dividend aristocrats and dividend kings blindly is a risky proposition, as you never know when the next shoe will drop from that list. Instead, it may be best to look for businesses that combine attractive fundamentals, dividends, and valuations with major macro tailwinds that can drive them to continued prosperity for years to come.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss stocks that are poised to profit from three macro trends that we see being quite prominent in the coming decade, if not longer: artificial intelligence, soaring geopolitical risks and conflicts, and the onset of stagflation for at least the next few years.\n\n#1. Artificial Intelligence Dividend Investments\n\nFor the portion of the portfolio that could profit from the artificial intelligence boom while still being income-focused, I think the best plays are Broadcom (AVGO) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ). While Broadcom no longer has a high yield due to its strong stock performance in recent years, its 1.4% dividend yield is still on the high end relative to many other major AI stocks. Additionally, the company has a track record of growing its dividend consistently and appears poised to continue doing so for years to come, with analysts expecting it to grow at a near 13% CAGR through 2028, making it a solid dividend growth pick while also leaning into the AI tailwind.\n\nInvestors can complement that by holding JEPQ, which has 52% of its portfolio invested in technology stocks, including all of its top ten holdings positioned to profit from artificial intelligence in some way. These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks. JEPQ implements a notional covered call strategy, enabling it to pay very lucrative monthly dividends equating to an 8.75% trailing 12-month yield. This means that an income investor can significantly boost their portfolio's income generation capabilities while also maintaining significant exposure to leading artificial intelligence plays, including Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN). I also like JEPQ at the moment because I believe the AI space is richly valued, and the covered call strategy implemented by JEPQ takes some of that risk off the table as their strategy exchanges some future upside for cash premiums on the covered calls, which I find attractive given the current market conditions.\n\n#2. Geopolitical Risk Dividend Investments\n\nWhen it comes to rising geopolitical risks, investing in major defense primes like General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) are good bets because they are the leading shipbuilders for the United States Navy. Given that the leading geopolitical challenge is in the Pacific from China, the U.S., along with its AUKUS allies, will likely invest aggressively in expanding its naval capabilities. In fact the U.S. Navy is already investing aggressively towards this end and the Biden administration recently requested even more funds to do so. If Trump gets elected in the Fall, it is highly likely that he will increase this effort even further as he has made building up the U.S. military and countering China a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda if he gets re-elected. This should profit GD and HII significantly. While their current dividend yields of about 2% each are not particularly high, their valuations are reasonable, with HII trading at a 14.9 P/E and GD at a 19.1 P/E. Additionally, both companies should be able to post strong earnings per share and dividend growth in the coming years. For example, HII is expected to grow its dividend per share at a 20% CAGR through 2028, and GD is expected to grow its dividend at about a 10% CAGR in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, I think that Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a worthwhile investment because gold will likely shoot higher from rising geopolitical risks and the continued de-dollarization around the world. Central banks are buying gold hand over fist, and Newmont, with its high-grade mines, provides leveraged exposure to the price of gold. Additionally, its concentration in jurisdictions with lower geopolitical risk should help it hold up well, even if global conflicts intensify.\n\n#3. Stagflation Dividend Investments\n\nWhen it comes to profiting from stagflation, I think buying the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is a good approach since most of the holdings in that ETF are fairly defensive in nature and grow their dividends at a strong clip, which should exceed inflation. However, I believe even better plays are infrastructure and real estate businesses that are not only very defensive and highly contracted in nature but also have inflation-linked revenue escalators. My four favorite picks for this type of investment are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)(BIPC), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)(BEPC), and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) (Enbridge (ENB) isn't a bad substitute for those looking to avoid a K1) in the infrastructure and energy spaces. All three have strong balance sheets, well-diversified portfolios of assets that are highly contracted and/or regulated, and significant inflation protections. W.P. Carey (WPC) is also compelling in the real estate space due to its CPI-linked leases and triple-net lease structure, providing significant cash flow visibility and a very long 12.2-year term to maturity on its leases.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nCombining these stocks into a $100,000 portfolio, I would allocate 15% to JEPQ and 5% to AVGO, giving the portfolio 20% exposure to the AI trade while still generating sufficient current income and dividend growth. For the geopolitical risk trade, I would allocate 5% to GD, 5% to HII, and 10% to NEM, though it may make sense to allocate 5% to Gold (GLD) and 5% to NEM to further mitigate risks. Finally, for the stagflation trade, I would allocate 10% each to EPD, BIP, BEP, and WPC, and 15% to SCHD. The result would be an attractive overall dividend yield along with strong dividend growth, with high single-digit annualized dividend growth expected for SCHD, BIP, BEP, and GD; double-digit annualized dividend growth expected for AVGO and HII; and mid-single-digit dividend growth expected for WPC and EPD. Overall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.",
        "summary": "These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks.\nJEPQ implements a notional covered call strategy, enabling it to pay very lucrative monthly dividends equating to an 8.75% trailing 12-month yield.\nAdditionally, both companies should be able to post strong earnings per share and dividend growth in the coming years.\nThe result would be an attractive overall dividend yield along with strong dividend growth, with high single-digit annualized dividend growth expected for SCHD, BIP, BEP, and GD; double-digit annualized dividend growth expected for AVGO and HII; and mid-single-digit dividend growth expected for WPC and EPD.\nOverall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.",

Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.\n\nDespite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college.

        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to own in the artificial intelligence (AI) race so far. The company's revenue has tripled year over year in recent quarters, sending the stock up 149% in the first half of 2024.\n\nAt these lofty share prices, Nvidia's valuation looks stretched. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio was less than 30 to start the year, but it now trades at a more expensive 45 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. Nvidia might experience enough growth to push the stock higher, but there's also a chance that near-term demand is already baked into the share price, which could limit the stock's gains through the end of the year.\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia isn't the only AI stock beating the market. Nvidia has benefited from tight supply of AI chips, but as supply improves, it could drive more demand for AI servers, and the stocks of these companies trade at more reasonable valuations, which could set up superior returns in the near term.\n\nHere are two AI server stocks that could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in 2024, up 188%. It sells rack-mount systems for data centers. Because of its exposure to the broader demand for AI chips, Supermicro (as it is also known) is a solid alternative to Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro sells into several markets, including 5G connectivity and edge computing. But demand for its plug-and-play rack systems that feature data center chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are key drivers of its growth right now. Revenue surged 200% year over year last quarter, which mirrors Nvidia's growth.\n\nSelling server systems is a competitive market, but it's encouraging to see Supermicro growing faster than the industry. It maintains close relationships with suppliers like Nvidia, which helps the company deliver innovative solutions before competitors. It's currently pushing the adoption of direct liquid cooling solutions, which it has developed for years, to better manage the heat generated from AI computing systems.\n\nIf it continues to outpace the rest of the server industry, the stock could have substantial upside. Wall Street analysts expect Supermicro's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 46% over the next several years -- higher than the 33% estimate for Nvidia.\n\nMoreover, Supermicro stock also offers better value than Nvidia. Its current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 35 -- lower than the 45 forward P/E multiple for Nvidia. Investors are getting more earnings growth for a lower price with Supermicro -- a recipe for superior returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) shares are up 80% year to date, but the company's shares could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year due to accelerating demand for the company's AI servers.\n\nDell generates most of its revenue from client solutions, which include sales of PCs, but infrastructure solutions is its fastest-growing business, with revenue up 22% year over year last quarter. AI server shipments more than doubled over the year-ago period. Over the last year, revenue from AI servers exploded from zero to $1.7 billion, and it's just getting started.\n\nSales of AI servers are weighing on Dell's gross margin, but the robust revenue growth expected in the AI server business could support substantial earnings growth to send the stock higher over the next few years.\n\nThe company's AI server backlog grew approximately 31% in the last quarter to $3.8 billion. That increase might reflect new business from Tesla, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. Dell seems to be in a strong competitive position, as the analyst believes that Dell won a larger amount of server business with the electric vehicle maker than Supermicro.\n\nWall Street analysts project earnings to grow 12% annually over the next several years, and those estimates might increase further once Dell's PC business recovers. The stock's forward P/E of 18 looks attractive against the potential for accelerating earnings growth and could provide superior returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 75%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "A resurgence in the popularity of stock splits has been front and center in 2024 as a number of high-profile stocks have taken the plunge. Companies will typically go down this path after years or even decades of robust operating and financial results have pushed the stock price out of reach of some investors. While a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying value of the business, it does make shares more affordable for employees and everyday investors, a reason that is often given by companies as the principal motivation for the split.\n\nInvestors, however, should focus on the robust results that ultimately led to the stock split, as this is historically an indicator of a business that is firing on all cylinders, which is a brilliant reason to own the stock.\n\nLet's take a look at two companies that still have significant upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 59%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with mounds of upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was already the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and in data centers. However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) early last year kicked its business into overdrive.\n\nThe company is referred to as a \"picks-and-shovels play.\" The investing reference has its origins in a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\" For the AI gold rush, Nvidia is supplying the picks and shovels.\n\nThe parallel-processing capability of Nvidia's GPUs was groundbreaking for rendering lifelike images in video games. It allows them to run a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It turns out this same functionality works equally well at processing AI.\n\nNvidia's recent results show why most analysts on Wall Street are upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes the processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest money maker, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.\n\nNvidia recently completed its high-profile, 10-for-1 stock split, and despite posting gains of more than 194% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains remarkably bullish. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann boosted his price target to $200 while reiterating a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 59% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerating demand for AI-centric processors forms the foundation of the analyst's thesis, but he believes the secret sauce is Nvidia's proprietary software that's coupled with its best-in-class chips.\n\n\"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. The analyst's price target suggests Nvidia's market will soar to nearly $5 trillion over the next year.\n\nDespite the stock's epic run over the past year, Wall Street is still remarkably bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Implied upside of 75%\n\nAnother stock-split stock with significant upside potential is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The company's focus on health-centric energy drinks has been a hit with consumers. It's the third-largest energy drink brand and the fastest-growing, contributing 47% of all industry growth in the first quarter, outpacing larger rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage.\n\nCelsius holds an enviable position in an industry that continues to grow. The energy drink category has continued to generate robust growth over the past three years, even as the broader beverage category has contracted -- and Celsius is leading the charge.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS surged 108%. It's always encouraging when profits are growing faster than revenue, as this illustrates that a company has reached the scale necessary to drop more income to the bottom line.\n\nThe company's sales more than doubled last year as it leaned into its partnership with PepsiCo, which resulted in the beverage and snacks giant making a $550 million investment in Celsius, taking an 8.5% stake in the company and inking a long-term distribution agreement. This is a double-edged sword, however, as Celsius now faces tough comps after such a banner year.\n\nCelsius Holdings conducted its 3-for-1 stock split late last year, thanks to its track record of robust performance. However, fears regarding slowing growth have punished the stock, which has shed 42% over the past month, but some on Wall Street are undaunted. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala has a $98 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 75% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst noted the drawdown is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and advises investors to ignore the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Celsius. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 14 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Is Nvidia Going to Crash in the Second Half of 2024? History Weighs in and Offers a Big Clue",
        "body": "Unless you've been living under a rock for the last year, you've probably noticed that the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. While a resilient U.S. economy has certainly played a role, the lion's share of the gains in the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite and benchmark S&P 500 can be attributed to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nIn simple terms, AI uses software and systems for tasks that humans would normally oversee or undertake. What makes AI special and gives the technology such wide-ranging utility is the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This can allow AI software and systems to become more proficient at tasks and perhaps even evolve to learn new skill sets.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe broad-reaching appeal of AI excited the analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) enough for them to estimate that this innovative technology could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. With dollar figures this large, there's room for multiple big-time winners.\n\nFor the time being, no company is more directly associated with the rise of AI than semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe $64,000 question is: Can Nvidia keep the good times rolling, or is a potential crash around the corner?\n\nNvidia has scaled like no market leader before it\n\nFor a very brief period this month, Nvidia pulled the crown away from Microsoft and Apple to become the most valuable publicly traded company. That's no small feat when you realize that Nvidia's market cap stood at less than $360 billion when the curtain opened for 2023.\n\nPretty much the entirety of Nvidia's $3 trillion increase in market cap over the last 18 months and its recent need to complete a 10-for-1 stock split have been fueled by the popularity of its AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the company's H100 GPUs have become the go-to chip for businesses looking to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in high-compute data centers. In terms of computability, Nvidia's chips haven't been surpassed.\n\nOn top of its first-mover advantages, Nvidia counts many of the country's most influential businesses as its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for around 40% of Nvidia's net sales. It's a testament to Nvidia that leading tech companies are lining up to use its GPUs in their AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nWe're also talking about a company that's enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its chips. Even with leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing substantially increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which is needed for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory, Nvidia isn't close to meeting enterprise demand for its GPUs. Higher prices lifted its adjusted gross margin to a jaw-dropping 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cherry on Nvidia's sundae is that it's held onto its innovative advantages. With external competitors like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices aiming to go head-to-head with the H100, Nvidia is readying to roll out its next-generation AI GPU architecture known as Blackwell.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Nvidia stock going to crash in the second half of 2024?\n\nOn paper, Nvidia can seemingly do no wrong. Wall Street's AI leader has blown past every revenue and profit forecast put in front of it for more than a year. Yet, despite this outperformance and blueprint scaling we've witnessed, the possibility of Nvidia's stock crashing in the second half of the year is within the potential range of outcomes over the next six months.\n\nHistory is the single biggest factor suggesting Nvidia has a non-zero chance of crashing in the latter half of the year. Specifically, I'm talking about the history of next-big-thing innovations/technologies and valuation-based history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the proliferation of the internet began changing corporate America's long-term growth arc. While there's no denying the internet was a game-changing innovation for businesses, it took time for this technology to mature and for businesses to figure out how they'd use direct-to-consumer channels to generate sales and profits.\n\nEvery next-big-thing innovation, technology, and trend that's come along since the internet has featured plenty of hype, big dollar figures, and a bubble-bursting event in its early stages. Whether we're talking about genome decoding, China stocks, nanotechnology, U.S. housing, 3D printing, cannabis stocks, blockchain technology, the metaverse, or the internet revolution of the mid-1990s, history conclusively shows us that all new trends and technologies need time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nAlthough Wall Street's leading businesses have no qualms about spending big on hardware for high-compute data centers, most companies lack a concrete plan as to how they're going to lean on AI to grow their sales and profits. This is consistent with previous next-big-thing innovations over the prior three decades and provides further evidence for why early-stage bubbles have occurred.\n\nCSCO PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe other history-based issue for Nvidia has to do with its valuation. In terms of its forward-year earnings multiple and price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio), Nvidia isn't raising any red flags. But pull up its trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and it's a completely different story.\n\nPrior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Cisco Systems' and Amazon's TTM P/S ratios peaked in the high 30s to low 40s. Nvidia's peak TTM P/S ratio occurred a little over a week ago at virtually the same level (about 42). While history doesn't repeat itself to a T on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme. For market-leading businesses, Nvidia is currently in rarified (and likely unsustainable) territory.\n\nUnfortunately, history isn't all that accurate at pinpointing when corrections and crashes will occur. While it's been spot-on for three decades when it comes to forecasting an eventual bubble-bursting event for next-big-thing innovations and technologies, it's anything but a guarantee that Nvidia's stock will crash during the second half of 2024.\n\nWhile Nvidia's AI hardware could be quite successful over the long run, and its market cap might motor considerably higher, allowing history to be the investors' guide suggests Nvidia's road is likely to get bumpier, at the very least, through the end of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Investors love tobacco stocks because of their high dividend yields and growing dividend payouts. Long-term shareholders in these companies have made a fortune by simply holding and watching the dividend payments pile up in their accounts.\n\nToday, Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has a dividend yield of 8.43%. The United States-focused tobacco giant can generate $1,000 in annual dividend income for investors who buy $11,862 worth of stock right now. But is this dividend sustainable? Is Altria Group a safe dividend stock today?\n\nI think it is. Here's why Altria Group is a smart play for investors looking to build a diversified dividend income portfolio.\n\nVolume declines, but rising new categories\n\nAltria Group owns the U.S. brand of Marlboro, which is the top premium cigarette in the country with around 40% market share. This dominance has been retained for decades. However, investors are worried about accelerating overall volume declines in the cigarette category, which has caused stocks such as Altria to underperform the market.\n\nFor example, last quarter Altria estimated that cigarette volumes declined by 9% year over year for the entire U.S. market. Despite this, the company's net revenue for smokeable products only declined by 2.3%, with segment operating profit declining by a similar amount as well. While this isn't an ideal situation, Altria has been able to raise prices to counteract volume declines for decades to maintain profits.\n\nSmokeable products are the majority of Altria's $11.4 billion in operating profits today, but they're increasingly getting replaced by new nicotine products in vaping and nicotine pouches. The company's recent acquisition of the Njoy brand has a market share of 4.3%, which grew by 0.6 percentage points last quarter. Now, the U.S. government and law enforcement are increasing crackdowns on illegal vaping devices, which should help Njoy greatly increase market share.\n\nOn top of this, the On! nicotine pouch brand grew shipment volumes by 32% year over year last quarter. It is still a tiny part of the brand portfolio but should continue to grow quickly. It might help too that the largest competitor in nicotine pouches, Zyn, is seeing supply shortages in the United States right now.\n\nThe dividend is not only safe, but can grow\n\nRecent 9% volume declines and a 2% decrease in profits for the smokeable category are concerning for investors. However, running the math on Altria's dividend payout shows the 8%+ dividend yield is here to stay.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Altria has paid a dividend per share of $3.88. Free cash flow per share -- the fuel for dividend payments -- was $5 and has been consistently above the dividend per share for the last five years. Altria is also reducing its shares outstanding through a stock buyback program, which has brought shares outstanding down by a cumulative 8% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving 8% fewer shares means an 8% lower cumulative dividend payout while maintaining the same dividend per share level. It also helps free cash flow per share grow, even if nominal free cash flow is flat. So, even if Altria's earnings stagnate due to heavy volume declines, the company has plenty of room to grow its dividend per share due to the wide spread between its dividend payout and free cash flow along with the consistent buyback program.\n\nMO Dividend Yield Chart\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nWith such a high dividend yield, I think contrarian investors looking to build retirement income are smart to buy Altria Group stock today. Its dividend yield has gone from less than 4% to over 8% in the last 10 years as the stock has suffered. But the business is still in fine shape and has the earnings power to maintain a growing dividend over the next five years and beyond.\n\nBuying a little over $11,000 of Altria stock can deliver $1,000 in dividend income to your portfolio every year. Investors should remember to diversify their holdings, though. If $11,000 is a large investment for you, start with a smaller amount and build up your dividend income by buying more shares over time. It is never smart to go all in on one stock, as no company is a risk-free investment. The same holds true for Altria and any other tobacco stock.\n\nWith investors piling into technology and AI stocks at huge earnings multiples, it may be smart to zig while others are zagging and buy some high-dividend-yield stocks like Altria Group in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Altria Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 AI Semiconductor Stocks Surged 150% and 122% in the First Half of 2024. Wall Street Says 1 Could Crash in the Second Half",
        "body": "The Nasdaq-100 tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The index is heavily weighted toward the technology sector, and it includes some of the most innovative companies in the world.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 returned 18% during the first half of 2024 due to excitement about artificial intelligence (AI). Investors showed a particular preference for two AI semiconductor stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) led the Nasdaq-100 higher, with shares soaring 150% and 122%, respectively, during the first half.\n\nWall Street is less optimistic about their prospects in the second half, especially where Arm is concerned. Nvidia carries a median price target of $128 per share, which implies 3% upside from its current price of $124 per share. But Arm carries a median price target of $120 per share, implying 28% downside from its current price of $167 per share.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia: The market leader in data center GPUs and AI processors\n\nNvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). The company accounted for 92% of data center GPU sales last year, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia has further entrenched its GPUs as the industry standard in AI computing by branching into other hardware markets. Its networking solutions recently surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion. And its Grace central processing unit (CPU) -- Nvidia's first data center server CPU -- is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nNvidia also provides subscription software and cloud services that help developers train large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning models (MLMs), and build all sorts of AI applications. That portion of its business recently surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. Nvidia has a nearly insurmountable economic moat in its ability to pair superior hardware with software and services that support AI projects, according to analysts.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at 33% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends January 2028). In that context, the current valuation of 69 times earnings is less expensive than it looks. Those numbers give a PEG ratio -- the price-to-earnings multiple divided by forecasted-earnings growth -- of 2.1, which is a substantial discount to the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nStory continues\n\nI have been a Nvidia shareholder since 2017, and I am happy with my position size. But if my portfolio lacked Nvidia exposure, I would feel comfortable buying a small position today, despite the muted, near-term outlook among Wall Street analysts.\n\nArm Holdings: The market leader in smartphone and mobile processors\n\nArm develops and licenses CPU products and development tools to clients like Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Those companies use Arm technology to design custom chips and systems that address various use cases. For instance, Arm Cortex processors are optimized for smartphones and mobile devices, while its Neoverse processors are optimized for cloud-computing workloads like artificial intelligence.\n\nEvery processor has an instruction-set architecture that defines how the hardware and software interact. Arm architecture has historically been associated with power efficiency, so Arm holds 99% market share in smartphones and over 60% market share in other mobile devices. But the x86 architecture used by Intel and AMD has historically been associated with computational performance, so those companies dominate the PC and data center markets.\n\nHowever, while Intel and AMD have failed to gain ground in the mobile-processor market, Arm has improved the computational performance of its CPUs and gained market share across consumer electronics and cloud computing. For example, Apple M-series chips and Amazon Graviton processors are built on Arm architecture, as are Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Grace Blackwell Superchips.\n\nArm reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), beating guidance on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 47% to $928 million, and non-GAAP net income improved to $0.36 per diluted share, up from $0.02 per diluted share in the prior year. But management expects momentum to slow. Guidance implies 22% revenue growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Arm to grow adjusted EPS at 23% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends March 2028). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 131 times earnings look outrageously expensive. Remember how Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 2.1? Well, Arm has a PEG ratio of 5.7.\n\nArm is an excellent business with compelling growth prospects. Wall Street may or may not be correct about Arm shares declining sharply in the coming months. but I plan to avoid this stock until it trades at a cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Coca-Cola: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "body": "It's not just one of the world's best-known brand names. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has also been -- and continues to be -- one of the world's more rewarding investments. Plenty of buy-and-hold investors have become millionaires while sitting on a long-term stake in Coca-Cola stock, well-rewarded for their patience.\n\nThe biggest name in the beverage business, however, isn't the company behind the industry's most rewarding stock. That honor actually belongs to shares of rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP).\n\nAnd the underpinnings of its superior performance aren't apt to change in the foreseeable future either.\n\nNumbers (and pictures) don't lie\n\nSurprised? It would be a little surprising if you weren't. Coca-Cola is viewed by most as the premier name in the drinks business, after all. But, it's true. Over the past 50 years, PepsiCo's share price has outgained Coke's nearly threefold.\n\nKO Chart\n\nVeteran investors will point out that Coke is dividend royalty -- literally. It hasn't just paid a quarterly dividend for decades now. It's also raised its full-year payout every year for the past 62 years, qualifying it as a Dividend King. As it stands right now only 53 stocks are eligible for the title.\n\nCare to guess one of the market's other Dividend Kings? If you said PepsiCo, you're right! It's raised its total yearly dividends for 52 consecutive years now. While its dividend-growth track record isn't quite as lengthy, the company's been upping its payouts at a measurably faster clip.\n\nKO Chart\n\nThe big question here, of course, is how? How is PepsiCo able to do what its bigger rival couldn't for its respective shareholders?\n\nThe answer is multifaceted, but it isn't complicated.\n\nPepsiCo is different than Coca-Cola in all the ways that matter\n\nTo fully understand how PepsiCo has achieved the unthinkable, take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\nPepsiCo isn't just a beverage company. Roughly half of its top line is actually driven by its snack foods segment made up of several familiar brand names including Doritos, Rold Gold pretzels, Fritos, Cheetos, and of course, Lay's potato chips. The North America snack foods division alone accounts for roughly half of the entire company's operating profits thanks to its far greater profit margins than the highly competitive beverage business could ever support. All told, Frito-Lay's operating profit margin is consistently in the ballpark of 25% of sales.\n\nCoca-Cola's operating margin is similar at around 20% of revenue, for the record. But, Coke's business is distinctly different than PepsiCo's drinks and snacks operation. Whereas PepsiCo does most of its own bottling and handles the bulk of its own food production, Coca-Cola's business model is largely royalty-focused -- the company punts the bulk of its production work to third-party bottlers that simply purchase Coke's concentrated syrups and pay franchise fees for the right to distribute its brand-name products.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a high-margin business model to be sure. But its revenue potential is also modest. Although Coca-Cola's brands of beverages easily outsell PepsiCo's in terms of the total amount of revenue produced, the company itself only collected $45.8 billion worth of sales last year, turning $11.3 billion of that into operating income. PepsiCo banked greater operating profits of just under $12 billion in 2023, reporting cash flow of $13.4 billion versus Coca-Cola's $11.6 billion.\n\nNo, PepsiCo isn't producing leaps and bounds more earnings and higher profit margins than its top beverage rival is. The nickels and dimes add up over time, however.\n\nIt's worth adding that while Coke's royalty/franchise model punts much of the risk of being a bottler to its partner bottlers, it also means Coca-Cola loses a bit of control of the production process. PepsiCo may not like operating its own production facilities, but having complete oversight of them still offers a strategic advantage. One of these advantages is being able to serve as a bottler for other brands including competing soft drink brands like Dr. Pepper, energy drink upstarts like Celsius, as well as juice brand Ocean Spray.\n\nPepsiCo's stock-buyback and stock-retirement programs are also consistently more shareholder-friendly than Coca-Cola's. Since mid-2004, PepsiCo has reduced its share count by more than 20%, versus Coke's reduction of just a little more than 11%.\n\nKO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) Chart\n\nJust buy PepsiCo stock and forget about it already\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, of course, meaning there's no assurance PepsiCo shares will continue minting more millionaires than more popular Coca-Cola stock does. Besides, there's more to stock-picking than mere numbers.\n\nThe underpinnings of these two stocks' different performances are largely rooted in each companies' products, operations, and corporate ethos though. Those are things that are unlikely to change anytime soon. And PepsiCo's management certainly doesn't want them to.\n\nBottom line? If you're considering a new position in either of these companies to round out the consumer goods portion of your portfolio, PepsiCo is (surprisingly enough) the better option at this time. That's particularly true in light of the fact that you'd be plugging in while its shares' forward-looking dividend yield stands at 3.24% versus Coke's lesser yield of just over 3%.\n\nDon't overthink this. More than that though, don't let your investing judgment be clouded by your personal preference or nostalgia for a particular brand of beverages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "AI's Growth Potential Has Helped Power a More Than 140% Rally for This Surprising Stock. Does It Still Have Fuel to Keep Heading Higher?",
        "body": "AI is a game-changing technology. It can significantly boost productivity and reduce costs. That's driving companies to pour billions of dollars into buying AI chips to train models and power applications.\n\nThe AI investment frenzy has driven up semiconductor stocks like Nvidia. However, chip sellers aren't the only ones benefiting from the AI boom. One potential beneficiary that might come as a surprise is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The leading nuclear power producer's stock has surged over 140% in the past year. Here's a look at what's fueling that rally and whether the power producer's stock can keep rising.\n\nAI needs data and power\n\nAI applications have several major requirements. They need an enormous amount of data to train AI models and a tremendous amount of power to run the specialized chips developed by companies like Nvidia. These catalysts are driving growing demand for data centers to house AI servers and processes.\n\nData centers are power-hungry facilities. They consume 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical office building. Meanwhile, AI data centers use even more power. For example, a generative AI search uses four to five times more computing power than a standard search. That drives the view that AI could cause a more than 160% increase in data center power demand by 2030, growing their consumption from 1%-2% of global usage to 3%-4%.\n\nThis surge in power demand is coming at a time when the world is already racing to transition from fossil fuels to lower-emissions alternatives. It could accelerate the already robust demand for renewables. However, renewable energy can't carry this entire load on its own. More intermittent power sources like wind and solar will need help from baseload power producers like natural gas and nuclear energy.\n\nThat's where Constellation Energy comes into play. It's the country's largest producer of carbon-free energy due mainly to its leading nuclear fleet. The company could benefit from increasing demand for nuclear energy to power data centers in the coming years. That has helped fuel its massive rally over the past year.\n\nPowerful growth ahead\n\nConstellation Energy is working to capture the AI power opportunity. The company's CEO, Joseph Dominguez, recently commented that:\n\nWe're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large -- well-known companies that you all know -- about powering their needs... While we're not done yet, I do expect that we will finalize agreements that will have long-term and transformational value.\n\nStory continues\n\nSigning power purchase agreements with large technology companies to power their AI data centers would supply Constellation with increasingly visible income from its existing plants. That would add to the company's already robust earnings growth outlook. Constellation Energy expects to grow its base earnings by more than 10% annually through 2028.\n\nThat outlook also doesn't include new expansion opportunities that could arise when AI accelerates power demand. Constellation Energy could secure additional opportunities to invest in renewable energy and storage projects. It could also provide new opportunities for investing in nuclear energy. For example, the company is looking into adding new small modular reactors and other technologies to help deliver more baseload energy to data centers.\n\nA look at what's left in the fuel tank\n\nWhile Constellation Energy has a lot of growth potential, that doesn't necessarily mean it will have plenty of power to continue rallying. Shares of the lower carbon energy producer currently trade at a forward P/E ratio of more than 28.5 times. That's pretty expensive, especially for a utility stock. It trades closer to the level of the fast-growing Nasdaq-100 index (nearly 29 times forward P/E). That's much more expensive than the broader market (the S&P 500's forward P/E is around 22 times) and other large utilities (they trade at 15 to 22 times forward P/E, though they are growing slower than Constellation at a mid-single-digit rate).\n\nThe current AI craze could continue driving up shares of Constellation Energy, especially if it inks contracts to supply nuclear power to AI data centers. However, it trades at a lofty valuation. Because of that, if AI power contracts fail to materialize or it hits an unexpected speed bump, shares could cool off quickly. That's why investors might want to put Constellation Energy on their watch list for now and consider another utility with AI-powered growth potential instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 ETFs That Could Benefit from a Trump Presidency",
        "body": "With election season underway, it\u2019s a good time to think about what industries and ETFs stand to benefit from a Trump presidency if the former President wins the election. The point of this article isn\u2019t to predict the outcome of the election or wade into politics, but with many observers saying that the former President won the first Presidential debate, it\u2019s a worthwhile exercise to look for ETFs representing industries and assets that could benefit significantly if Donald Trump wins and returns to the White House.\n\nHere are three ETFs: the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI), the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT), and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE).\n\nIf Trump wins in November, he will have the opportunity to appoint his own administrators and regulators to important positions. This would significantly shape U.S. policy toward various industries and make these ETFs potentially interesting investment opportunities.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI)\n\nBased on Trump\u2019s pro-crypto pivot, a Trump administration would likely unshackle the U.S. crypto industry itself, and perhaps no segment of the industry would benefit more than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners, which is what the WGMI ETF invests in.\n\nThe Biden administration previously proposed a heavy excise tax on Bitcoin miners, which would subject them to a prohibitive 30% tax on their electricity costs, effectively making Bitcoin mining in the United States untenable. It\u2019s no secret that Biden and his administration are not fans of what they view as an energy-intensive industry.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has a significantly more favorable view of the industry. In fact, Trump recently met with the CEOs of Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), two of the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin miners, to listen to their concerns and offer his support.\n\nIndustry leaders from a variety of crypto companies voiced their concerns to Trump that some of the brightest minds in the industry are leaving the U.S. because of a hostile regulatory climate, leading Trump to state, \u201cWe\u2019re going to embrace them if we want them to stay.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with them, Trump emphatically declared his support for the industry, declaring that he wants all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the U.S.\n\nWGMI is a unique and effective way to gain undiluted exposure to the stocks of Bitcoin miners. The entire ETF is devoted to Bitcoin miners as well as the semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) whose graphic processing units (GPUs) enable Bitcoin mining.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can check out an overview of WGMI\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nThis is a bit of a \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d investment, as it is a small ETF with just $123.7 million in assets under management and little in the way of diversification, as it owns just 20 stocks. Furthermore, its expense ratio of 0.75% is on the higher end.\n\nFor these reasons, an investment in WGMI likely isn\u2019t for everybody, but if Trump wins and ushers in a new administration that treats the Bitcoin mining industry more favorably, it\u2019s hard to think of an investment that would benefit more, so I\u2019m bullish on WGMI.\n\nIs WGMI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, WGMI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average WGMI stock price target of $29.56 implies 39.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT)\n\nAs noted above, a Trump administration would certainly treat the burgeoning crypto industry more favorably than the Biden administration has. Plus, Trump would have the opportunity to appoint his own regulators, which would potentially unburden the industry from many of the onerous regulations it is dealing with now.\n\nTrump has taken to his Truth Social Platform to state, \u201cOur country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place\u2026 I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.\u201d\n\nAs an ETF that gives investors undiluted exposure to Bitcoin by buying it directly, the iShares Bitcoin Trust from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is a simple, effective way to make a directional bet on Bitcoin and the growth of the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Additionally, if you don\u2019t want to take on the operational risks and other company-specific considerations that come with investing in Bitcoin miners or other crypto-related companies, IBIT offers an elegant way to simply bet on Bitcoin itself.\n\nIBIT is the largest of the new Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024, with $18.9 billion in assets under management (AUM). IBIT has taken the market by storm, reaching $10 billion in AUM in a mere 37 days, highlighting the strong demand for Bitcoin exposure by the investing public in the United States. A pro-crypto President would likely further add to Bitcoin\u2019s mainstream appeal. Also, IBIT is a cost-effective way to gain exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF, with a cost-effective expense ratio of just 0.12%.\n\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE)\n\nTrump is pro-oil and clearly more pro-oil than current President Joe Biden, so a Trump presidency would be a big boost to the U.S. shale industry. XLE is a great way to invest in this space, as it offers investors exposure to the energy sector of the S&P 500 (SPX), with large positions in energy majors like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) plus other top U.S. oil stocks.\n\nYou can check out an overview of XLE\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nFurthermore, XLE comes with an above-average dividend yield of 3.2% and charges a very small fee with an expense ratio of just 0.09%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $9 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIs XLE Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XLE earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XLE stock price target of $109.03 implies 19.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\nLooking Ahead to November\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say who will win the Presidential Election in the U.S., and the purpose of this article is not to forecast or endorse a winner.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s never too early to look ahead, and it\u2019s never a bad idea for investors to think about what industries and investments could see upside or downside based on elections. Additionally, investors should consider positioning their portfolios to capitalize on these potential changes.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on these three ETFs, WGMI, IBIT, and XLE, as they could all be major beneficiaries of a Trump win in November. This is based on the fact that a Trump administration would regulate and treat the Energy and Cryptocurrency industries very differently than the current Biden administration has.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Biden acknowledges age, bad debate performance but vows to beat Trump By Reuters",
        "body": "By Steve Holland, Tim Reid and David Morgan\n\nRALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Friday he intended to defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the November presidential election, giving no sign he would consider dropping out of the race after a feeble debate performance that dismayed his fellow Democrats.\n\n\"I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,\" an ebullient Biden said at a rally one day after the head-to-head showdown with his Republican rival, which was widely viewed as a defeat for the 81-year-old president.\n\n\"I don't walk as easy as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to,\" he said, as the crowd chanted \"four more years.\"\n\n\"I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. The stakes are too high,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's verbal stumbles and occasionally meandering responses in the debate heightened voter concerns that he might not be fit to serve another four-year term and prompted some of his fellow Democrats to wonder whether they could replace him as their candidate for the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCampaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said there were no conversations taking place about that possibility. \"We'd rather have one bad night than a candidate with a bad vision for where he wants to take the country,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nThe campaign held an \"all hands on deck\" meeting on Friday afternoon to reassure staffers that Biden was not dropping out of the race, according to two people familiar with the meeting.\n\nThough Trump, 78, put forward a series of falsehoods throughout the debate, the focus afterward was squarely on Biden, especially among Democrats.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Party leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, avoided answering directly when asked whether he still had faith in Biden's candidacy.\n\n\u201cI support the ticket. I support the Senate Democratic majority. We're going to do everything possible to take back the House in November. Thank you, everyone,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSome other Democrats likewise demurred when asked if Biden should stay in the race. \"That's the president's decision,\" Democratic Senator Jack Reed told a local TV station in Rhode Island.\n\nBut several of the party's most senior figures, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said they were sticking with Biden.\n\n\"Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and somebody who only cares about himself,\" former Democratic President Barack Obama wrote on X.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board, which endorsed Biden in 2020, called on him to drop out of the race to give the Democratic Party a better chance of beating Trump by picking another candidate. \"The greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it raised $14 million on Thursday and Friday and posted its single best hour of fundraising immediately after the Thursday night debate. The Trump campaign said it raised $8 million on the night of the debate.\n\nOne possible bright spot for Biden: preliminary viewership data showed that only 48 million Americans watched the debate, far short of the 73 million who watched the candidates' last face-off in 2020.\n\nBiden, already the oldest American president in history, faced only token opposition during the party's months-long nominating contest, and he has secured enough support to guarantee his spot as the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump likewise overcame his intra-party challengers early in the year, setting the stage for a long and bitter general election fight.\n\nIf Biden were to step aside, the party would have less than two months to pick another nominee at its national convention, which starts on Aug. 19 - a potentially messy process that could pit Kamala Harris, the nation's first Black female vice president, against governors and other officeholders whose names have been floated as possible replacements.\n\nTRUMP TARGETS VIRGINIA\n\nAt an afternoon rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, Trump told supporters that he had a \"big victory against a man looking to destroy our country.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden's problem is not his age,\" Trump said. \"It's his competence.\"\n\nTrump advisers said they thought the debate would bolster their chances in Democratic-leaning states like Virginia, which has not backed a Republican presidential candidate since 2004.\n\nBeforehand, some Trump supporters said they were struck by Biden's poor performance. \u201cI\u2019m scared they are going to replace him and put up somebody more competitive,\u201d said Mike Boatman, who said he had attended more than 90 Trump rallies.\n\nTrump fundraisers said they were fielding enthusiastic calls from donors. \"Anyone who raises money knows there's a time to go to donors, and this is one of those watershed moments,\" said Ed McMullen, who served as ambassador to Switzerland during Trump's presidency.\n\nQuestions about Trump's fitness for office have also arisen over his conviction last month in New York for covering up a hush money payment to a porn star, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his chaotic term in office.\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, just days before his party convenes to formally nominate him. He still faces three other criminal indictments, though none appears likely to reach trial before November.\n\nBiden's shaky performance in the debate drew stunned global reactions on Friday, prompting public calls for him to step aside and likely leaving some of America's closest allies steeling for Trump's return.",

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.",

        "title": "India opposition asks Modi government to question Foxconn hiring practices By Reuters",
        "body": "By Aditya Kalra and Praveen Paramasivam\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition Congress urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Saturday to question Foxconn about its hiring practices after Reuters reported that the Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier rejects married women from iPhone assembly jobs in the country.\n\nThe government has sought a detailed report from the state of Tamil Nadu, site of a major iPhone factory where Reuters uncovered Foxconn's hiring practices. The story has sparked debates on TV channels, newspaper editorials and calls from women groups, including within Modi's party, to investigate the matter.\n\nCongress lawmaker Karti P. Chidambaram wrote in a letter to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya that Foxconn receives \"substantial incentives\" from the federal government and the company should be asked to explain its practices to ensure it complies with \"Indian laws and values\".\n\n\"While foreign investment is crucial, it should not come at the cost of disregarding our cultural values,\" Chidambaram wrote in the letter, posted on X.\n\nApple, Taiwan-based Foxconn and the ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Congress letter.\n\nThe Reuters investigation found Foxconn has systematically excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant on the grounds they have more family responsibilities than their unmarried counterparts.\n\nFoxconn hiring agents and HR sources cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons for not hiring married women.\n\nResponding to the investigation, published on Tuesday, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged to Reuters lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and said they had worked to address the issues. All the discriminatory practices documented by Reuters at the Sriperumbudur plant, however, took place in 2023 and 2024.\n\nFoxconn said it \"vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form.\"\n\nApple said all its suppliers, including Foxconn, hire married women and \"when concerns about hiring practices were first raised in 2022 we immediately took action and worked with our supplier to conduct monthly audits to identify issues and ensure that our high standards are upheld.\"\n\nThe Foxconn positions in India offer food and accommodation and a monthly paycheck of about $200. In China, six online job ads reviewed by Reuters showed workers engaged in iPhone assembly at Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant can earn $400 to $800 a month. The ads did not mention marital status or gender requirements.\n\n\"While they don't discriminate in China, can they do whatever in India?,\" Vasuki Umanath of the Communist Party Of India (Marxist), another Modi opponent, told Reuters on Thursday.\n\n\"Labour unions, women's welfare organizations and democratic forces should raise their voice against this discrimination.\"\n\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation party said this week that action must be taken against what it said were \"exploitative and discriminatory (hiring) practice\".",

        "body": "Since the start of 2024, investors have been mainly fixated on when the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates.\n\nInitially, March seemed like a probable time to do it, but expectations then shifted to June after an unfavorable spate of economic data. Now, for those same reasons, the first cut may not occur until December, if at all this year, though economists at UBS still anticipate a cut in September.\n\nHowever, the investment outlook actually hinges less on when the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates and more on the path and destination thereafter, analysts at UBS said.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that the rose almost 15% year-to-date despite market pricing for cuts in 2024 dropping from nearly seven to below two now.\n\n\u201cWhat has mattered is that economic growth and earnings have been better than expected,\u201d they explained. \u201cWhether the first cut is in September or December likely won\u2019t make any material difference for either over the next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsequently, expect the debate over the pace, magnitude, and terminal level for rate cuts to be front and center this summer, a point made in our second-half outlook,\u201d analysts added.\n\nThis reflects the consensus view for macro conditions in the rest of 2024, with most investors expecting moderate GDP growth and inflation, low recession risk, and a realistic range of zero to two rate cuts. However, the range of possible outcomes for growth, inflation, fiscal policy, and Fed rate cuts is much wider for 2025 and beyond, analysts remarked.\n\nWhen focusing on the rate path, in particular, the debate is relevant for the investment outlook for three main reasons, the note states.\n\nFirstly, fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury yield have closely mirrored changes in market expectations for the neutral federal funds rate, suggesting that shifts in anticipated Fed rate cuts could similarly impact the 10-year yield.\n\nSecondly, the debate over the neutral federal funds rate (r*) and how restrictive current monetary policy is remains critical. Opinions vary significantly, with some arguing that the policy is not very restrictive and others maintaining that the neutral rate is around 3%.\n\n\u201cThe resilience of the US economy favors the former view for now, but a rapid growth deceleration could tip it toward the latter,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nLastly, the lack of a clear framework from the Fed regarding the rate-cutting path is a source of potential market volatility.\n\nWhile the Fed\u2019s \"dot plot\" suggests a steady pace of cuts until the funds rate reaches 3-3.25% by December 2026, it remains uncertain how the Fed will respond to deviations from its growth and inflation forecasts.\n\nAs economic conditions evolve, large oscillations in rate cut expectations are likely, potentially contributing to market volatility.",

Benchmark thinks the stock is significantly undervalued and said it is time to \"establish a new long position, increase an existing weighting or cover a short.\"\n\nBenchmark argues that \"the stock is mispriced relative to fundamental reality.\" They view the current price as a major buying opportunity, especially considering it's close to levels seen during major crises like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe low valuation is even more striking when compared to Schlumberger's current financial health. Benchmark highlights the company's \"EV/EBITDA multiple of ~7x, the lowest valuation in a non-crisis year since 2011-13.\"\n\nHistorically, such low valuations have been followed by significant rebounds, with Benchmark citing an average gain of \"20% within 3-weeks.\"\n\nFurthermore, Benchmark believes Schlumberger's strong fundamentals justify a higher stock price. Their estimates include the recent acquisition of ChampionX (CHX), which strengthens Schlumberger's position in the production sector.\n\nDespite solid financials, Schlumberger's valuation remains lower than historical averages, presenting a significant \"multiple reversion\" opportunity.\n\nBeyond financials, Benchmark highlights several positive developments for Schlumberger.\n\nThe company benefits from strong revenue visibility due to long-term international and offshore projects. The recent acquisition of CHX bolsters Schlumberger's presence in artificial lift and production chemicals.\n\nFurthermore, Benchmark says Schlumberger's AI-powered solutions are experiencing rapid growth and are expected to be a significant profit driver.

They advise using these dips to add to your U.S. Large Cap Equity holdings, their preferred equity class.\n\nLock in Yields with Longer-Duration Bonds: With interest rates at multi-year highs, Wells Fargo sees an opportunity to generate income with \"U.S. Short Term Taxable Fixed Income.\" They suggest considering longer-term maturities to lock in attractive rates when yields reach the higher end of the range (4.25% - 5.00%).\n\nInvest in Growth Sectors: Fueled by infrastructure spending and AI advancements, Wells Fargo recommends overweighting allocations in Energy, Industrials, and Materials sectors. They also highlight data center REITs and energy companies poised to benefit from the data storage and power needs of AI.\n\nHedge Uncertainty with Alternatives: Alternative investments like Relative Value and Event-driven strategies can add diversification and potentially offset market volatility. Additionally, Wells Fargo sees private capital emerging as a compelling option due to trends like AI and lower valuations.\n\nHedge Risks with Geopolitical Plays: Given the heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty, Wells Fargo suggests using the US dollar, US equities, and investment-grade fixed income as hedges. They also favor commodities and precious metals for their potential inflation hedge and to mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by global conflicts.",

        "title": "Why Economists and Citizens Have Different Inflation Realities",
        "body": "The Fed and economists are encouraged because is down to 3.3% from a high of nearly 9% in 2022. Despite the Fed\u2019s \u201csignificant progress\u201d in lowering inflation, most citizens are outraged and confused by economists\u2019 relatively rosy inflation observations. Most citizens believe inflation is still rampant.\n\nThe Fed and economists are correct in that inflation is now tame. At the same time, citizens dissatisfied with high prices have solid grounds on which to base their disapproval.\n\nLet\u2019s better understand how such contradictory beliefs can both be factual. Furthermore, in the process, we can help Jerome Powell understand why economic sentiment is poor despite a near-record low unemployment rate.\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t think anyone knows, has a definitive answer why people are not as happy about the economy as they might be. -Jerome Powell 6/12/2024\n\nVisualizing Divergent Inflation Opinions\n\nThe graph below of the BLS CPI New Vehicles price index, a CPI component, demonstrates why economists and citizens have such grossly contrasting opinions of inflation.\n\nEconomists focus on the blue line, graphing the year-over-year change in new vehicle prices. Over the last year, the price index of new vehicles has decreased by .60%. Economists can say the cost of buying a new vehicle is in a deflationary state.\n\nWhile the chart may warm the hearts of economists and the Fed, most individuals see the orange line, the CPI price index for new vehicles instead. It shows that new vehicle prices are up about 20% since the pandemic. Yes, they may have recently declined slightly, but today\u2019s prices are nowhere close to where they were four years ago. In their minds, there is significant inflation in new vehicles.\n\nEconomists Prefer Growth Rates, Not Absolutes\n\nAsk an economist what the nation\u2019s is, and they will quote an annualized growth rate to a decimal point. We bet almost all of them will get the answer correct within one or two-tenths of one percent.\n\nAsk them again, but request the answer in dollars. It would not be surprising if many economists are off by a trillion or even two trillion dollars, representing anywhere from 3.00% to 7.00% of the economy.\n\nEconomists prefer to analyze and quote many economic data points in terms of percentage change. For instance, how much did industrial production or retail sales change versus last month or over the previous quarter or year? They vastly prefer growth rates because it gives them a comparable and insightful way of analyzing economic data. Let\u2019s review why this is the case.\n\nComparative Analysis\n\nEconomists are more adept at comparing data from different periods, industries, and countries if they have a common measurement calculation. Instead of absolute change, which doesn\u2019t account for the starting point, a growth rate captures the absolute change and the starting point. Consider the following:\n\nIf GDP increases by $1 trillion this year, how would that compare to a $1 trillion increase in 2000? The question is challenging to answer using absolute numbers. However, growth rates allow us to evaluate the two periods quickly. Today, GDP is $28.284 trillion; therefore, a $1 trillion increase would represent 3.50% growth. In 2000, GDP was close to $10 trillion. Adding a trillion dollars of economic growth would have resulted in a 10% growth rate. While a trillion dollars is a trillion dollars in absolute terms, there is a stark difference between 10% and 3.50% growth.\n\nTrend Analysis\n\nGrowth rates highlight trends and changes over time more clearly than absolute numbers. They can show whether an economy is accelerating, decelerating, or maintaining a steady pace.\n\nConsider the graph below. The blue line, showing the make-believe production of widgets, starts at 1,000 widgets and increases by 100 widgets annually. The steady growth in absolute terms is a linear upward trending line. However, the annual growth rate steadily declines from 10% to 4% by year 20. An economist looking at the graph would say the rate of the production of widgets is declining despite the upward trend in the number of widgets being produced annually.\n\nPolicy Decision Making\n\nThe Fed aims to promote stable economic growth. To do so they balance the level of interest rates with inflation and economic activity. Having like figures to analyze, such as growth rates, makes their task significantly more straightforward. Imagine if the Fed had to determine the appropriate interest rate given that the economy grew by $750 billion last year and the CPI price index rose by 2.45.\n\nInvestors prefer growth rates for the same reason. If I can estimate the economy\u2019s growth rate and other critical economic figures, they can better determine a growth rate or interest rate they would accept for taking risks.\n\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a bedrock for finance. The formula states that an asset\u2019s expected return should equal the risk-free interest rate plus the asset\u2019s sensitivity (beta) times the market\u2019s expected return. This formula can only work with growth rates, not absolute numbers.\n\nConsumer\u2019s Point Of View\n\nRegarding inflation, consumers are less concerned with growth rates and heavily focused on absolute prices. They remember that bread used to cost $4 a loaf and now costs $7. The graph below shows the price of white bread was stable between $1.25 and $1.50 a pound from 2008 to the pandemic. It is now close to $2 a pound.\n\nThat is significant inflation. But it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. If wages also rose similarly, purchasing power hasn\u2019t changed. It is similar to hearing stories from your parents or grandparents about going to the movies and getting popcorn and a soda, all for $1. Did you ever ask them how much money they made at the time?\n\nSummary\n\nWe want to make it clear that we do not condone inflation. It accelerates an already wide wealth gap and creates hardships for many citizens. For more, please read our article, .\n\nWe analyze inflation data similarly to economists. We accept that absolute prices are much higher today than a few years ago, but we also acknowledge that, in general, wages are higher as well. Just like we can\u2019t realistically compare a 15-cent ) hamburger to a $3.00 one today, we should be careful comparing prices today to their prices a few years ago.\n\nPrices are not returning to 2020 levels. In fact, any hint that aggregate prices retreat from current levels will cause the Fed to panic and quickly stimulate inflation via lower interest rates and QE.

        "body": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative tightening (QT) program will conclude this December without causing significant market disruption, analysts at Barclays said in a recent note.\n\nAs they highlighted, this stands in stark contrast to the abrupt end of QT in 2019, which triggered a funding shock. The analysis from Barclays highlights the measures the Fed has implemented to avoid repeating past mistakes and ensure a smooth transition.\n\n\u201cThe Fed continued QT for too long in 2019,\u201d Barclays noted. \u201cIt did not have a good sense for banks' preferred levels of precautionary liquidity, and it focused too closely on developments in the fed funds market.\u201d\n\nThis time, the Fed is taking a more cautious approach. The central bank has broadened its monitoring of funding conditions and started tapering QT with reserves still above $3.4 trillion. Moreover, central clearing and the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provide additional safeguards against a funding shock similar to 2019.\n\nSeveral indicators that signaled market strains in 2018-19 are now elevated. Hedge funds have similar levels of long Treasury positions financed with secured borrowing, and dealer balance sheets are congested with record-high Treasury holdings.\n\nNow, Barclays believes that the Fed's preparedness and proactive measures will ensure a smooth end to QT.\n\n\u201cWe think there are two factors pointing to a cleaner end to QT this year,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cFirst, the Fed seems to be paying more attention to markets and conditions outside the fed funds market,\u201d the analysts state.\n\nThe second factor contributing to Barclays\u2019 confidence is the expansion of sponsored repo activity and central clearing since 2020. These measures have significantly increased dealers' balance sheet capacity through netting.\n\n\u201cSponsored repo \u2013 and central clearing more generally \u2013 expands dealers' balance sheet capacity through netting. Sponsored repo (longs and shorts) exceeds $1 trillion and has more than doubled since 2019,\u201d the report highlights.\n\nIn sum, Barclays expects the Fed to end QT in December \u201cwith hardly a whimper\u201d and \u201cwell before signs of stress emerge in either the fed funds or repo market.\u201d",

        "title": "Carrier's Business Transformation Adds Value (NYSE:CARR)",
        "body": "JaniceRichard/E+ via Getty Images\n\nOver the past 14 months, Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) has been on an aggressive strategy to streamline its business into a company with a much more narrowed focus. In early 2023, the company announced a vision to transform itself into a pure-play leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Through acquisitions and divestments, Carrier has accomplished this vision at a remarkably fast pace, and now it needs to show the market it can capitalize on this transformation. This article will focus on the background of the transformation, how Carrier stacks up against its peers in the industry, and whether Carrier can reward shareholders going forward.\n\nViessman Climate Solutions\n\nThe cornerstone of Carrier\u2019s vision to improve its renewed focus to become the global leader in heating and cooling solutions was the purchase of Viessman Climate Solutions in early 2023. Carrier paid \u20ac12 billion in cash and stock for Viessman. Viessman is a well-established and premium brand in Europe and drastically improves Carrier\u2019s footprint in Europe. Viessman brings with it annual sales of roughly \u20ac4 billion, as well as a well-established direct-to-installer model that includes more than 75,000 installers in 25 countries. This bolt-on acquisition has grown 15% on a compounded annual growth rate basis since 2020 and Carrier expects to see double-digit growth to continue through 2030.\n\nKey to Viessman\u2019s continued success is the explosion of heat pump adoption across Europe. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent halting of natural gas exports from Russia to Europe, sparked Europeans to electrify their home heating so they wouldn\u2019t be reliant on natural gas and their inherent price spikes and fluctuations. In addition, European governments began offering enticing incentives. Due to this continued rapid adoption, Carrier projects the current \u20ac5 billion heat pump market to triple in size by 2030 to \u20ac15 billion.\n\nDivestments\n\nTo help fund Carrier\u2019s acquisition of Viessman, the company made the decision to divest all non-core businesses. The company identified 4 business segments for sale; Global Business Solutions, Commercial Refrigeration, Industrial Fire Solutions, and Residential and Commercial Fire Solutions.\n\nCarrier kicked off its divestment spree by selling its Global Business Solutions to Honeywell (HON) for an enterprise value of $4.95 billion. At 17x 2023 EBITDA, Carrier was able to get a premium for the segment. Just one week later, Carrier was able to sell its Commercial Refrigeration unit to Haier for an enterprise value of $775 million. In 1Q2024, the company announced the sale of its Industrial Fire Business to Sentinel Capital Partners for $1.425 billion.\n\nWith the sale of 3 of its 4 identified business units, Carrier has received net proceeds of around $5.5 billion. This leaves only the residential and commercial fire business on the chopping block, and management is confident they can finalize a buyer in the next several months. Ever since the business transformation was announced, management made it clear that it would use the proceeds from any business sale to deleverage the balance sheet. In a recent presentation, CFO Patrick Goris stated,\n\nWhat we have said is that $5.5 billion would go towards deleveraging the company. And so, we will first paydown our term loans, they carry the highest interest rate. After that, we'll see what we will paydown, what makes the most economical sense. We actually might decide to keep cash on the books for a little while, because in today's environment, the cash may earn more than some of our debt.\n\nIn addition to debt repayment, the company has also announced they plan to begin share repurchases toward the end of 2024 through the use of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of the residential and commercial fire business. Carrier issued 58 million shares to help fund the acquisition of Viessman and the company intends to repurchase all dilution from that transaction.\n\nCarrier streamlining its business to focus on its core competency of heating and cooling solutions makes a lot of sense. The move will allow the company to focus on revenue growth and margins in a much simpler manner. Carrier expects to realize $200 million in cost synergies by 2026 with around $75 million reduced in 2024. In addition, the acquisition will be accretive to EPS in 2025.\n\nInvestors need to determine if Carrier\u2019s business transformation will reward shareholders going forward. There\u2019s no question the acquisition of Viessman improved its market share in Europe, but can the new simplified company gain market share from industry titans like Lennox (LII) and Trane (TT) in the US and ex-US?\n\nValuation to Peers\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSince the announcement of the company\u2019s business transformation and acquisition of Viessman, Carrier has drastically underperformed its peers. Unlike Carrier, Trane and Lennox have undergone a significant rerating in their valuations. Historically, these stocks have held a forward price/earnings multiple in the high teens to low twenties. However, over the past 12 months, these valuations have spiked as the shares rapidly appreciated.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nMuch of this outperformance from Trane likely comes from their leading organic growth rate of 8-9% compared to Lennox at 4-5% and Carrier at just 2% organic growth. For 2024, Carrier sees revenue up 12% including acquisitions and divestitures. It will take a few more quarters before investors get a clear view of Carrier operating solely within its new slimmed down company, similar to Lennox and Trane. However, investors can expect Carrier\u2019s adjusted operating margin going forward will be similar to peers. Carrier expects Viessman adjusted operating margins around 15.5%, in-line with its existing heating/cooling solutions.\n\nBuy Thesis\n\nWith Carrier underperforming its peers and trading at a lower valuation without meaningful differences in growth and margins, Carrier may be due for a catch-up trade. As the company completes its transformation, investors will have to take a second look at Carrier and make the decision if it truly deserves to trade at such a large discount to its peers.\n\nThe HVAC industry has numerous tailwinds and megatrends in its favor, and Carrier is set to capitalize. First, no analysis is complete without a clear picture of the effect of AI on the company and its industry. Obviously, cooling solutions are integral to AI data centers and the HVAC industry is seen as a clear beneficiary. During Carrier\u2019s 1Q2024 earnings call, CEO David Gitlin, stated,\n\nToday, AI makes up about 20% of the load of a typical data center, and some of our customers project that percentage to increase to 80% in the next few years, thus spurring huge demand on the grid and increasing the need for differentiated HVAC and control solutions. Accordingly, the data center market for the HVAC business is projected to increase from roughly $7 billion in 2023 to $15 billion to $20 billion in 2027. For us, this vertical represents a low double-digit percentage of our global commercial HVAC applied business. And we see a tremendous opportunity of increasing this segment to well over 20% of our commercial HVAC sales in the next few years. We doubled our backlog in Q1 alone, and in April, secured further key wins as we optimize the use of our global footprint to support our customers.\n\nWith Carrier expecting its data center business to grow from a low double-digit percentage of commercial HVAC business to over 20% in the next few years, it expects its data center business to essentially match the HVAC data center potential of 20% CAGR through 2027.\n\nAnother trend favoring Carrier is the increased prevalence of heat waves gripping large populations across the globe. Just this past weekend, over 100 million people across the east coast of the US were under heat advisory warnings. This punctuates the need for efficient HVAC systems in some areas that historically may not have always had an air conditioning unit in homes. It also increases the strain on older units, causing mechanical failure sooner than may be expected. In a bit of irony, as I started writing this article over the weekend in central Texas, my AC suddenly stopped working. This prompted a scramble for parts (in my non-Carrier unit) and bids for new AC units. As one might expect, Carrier sees lumpy quarterly revenue which is back-loaded with the majority of revenue coming in Q3 and Q4. But earlier and earlier heat waves may result in an increasing of the revenue across the back half of Q2 as well.\n\nIn a final trend seen across Europe, heat pumps are rapidly becoming the standard in HVAC installations as a result of government incentives and efficiency. Viessman puts Carrier at the forefront of this trend across Europe. Carrier projects the heat pump market to grow at 20% CAGR through 2030. While it may not be in a straight line and there could be lumpiness in growing the heat pump market from \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac15 by 2030, Carrier will be a leader in the space and capture significant market share.\n\nAt its current $62/share and 22 forward price/earnings, Carrier is trading at the higher end of its historical average valuation. I\u2019d recommend investors with a 3-5 year timeline slowly accumulate shares to take advantage of any price volatility. While the stock could rally and catch up to the valuations of its peers, I believe it\u2019s more likely Trane and Lennox trade back toward Carrier\u2019s level. However, as Carrier transitions into a pure play heating and cooling business, the company has numerous growth levers it can take advantage of over the medium-to-long-term.\n\nAs Carrier completes its transformation and starts to see more and more of the tailwinds mentioned above, I expect Carrier to begin seeing improvement in organic growth to mid-to-high single digits and margins to stay steady around 15-16%. Also taking into account, Carrier will repurchase 58 million shares, or 6.5% of total outstanding shares, the company should see EPS growth in the low double-digits. Along with a deleveraged balance sheet, the fundamentals of Carrier will be much improved in 2025. As a result, I\u2019d place a 12-18 month price target of $72/share.",

        "title": "Iran presidential candidate Jalili is fiercely loyal to Khamenei By Reuters",
        "body": "By Parisa Hafezi\n\nDUBAI(Reuters) - Saeed Jalili, a zealous ideologue loyal to Iran's supreme leader, plans to resolve the country's social, political and economic ills by adhering rigidly to the hardline ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution if he wins the country's presidential election.\n\nJalili was narrowly beaten in Friday's first round vote by moderate Massoud Pezeshkian but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\nJalili, a former diplomat, describes himself as a pious believer in \"velayat-e faqih\", or rule by supreme jurisprudence, the system of Islamic government that provides the basis for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's paramount position.\n\nHis staunch defence of the 45-year-old Islamic revolution appears designed to appeal to hardline, religiously-devout lower-income voters but offered little to young and urban Iranians frustrated by curbs on political and social freedoms.\n\nOnce Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Jalili, 58, was one of four candidates in the election for a successor to Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nHe is currently a member of a body that mediates in disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a body that screens election candidates for their political and Islamic qualifications.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's advance to the second round signals the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nForeign and nuclear policy are the domain of Khamenei, who wields supreme command of the armed forces, has the power to declare war and appoints senior figures including armed forces commanders, judicial heads and the head of the state media.\n\nHowever, the president can influence the tone of foreign and domestic policy.\n\nInsiders and analysts say Khamenei, 85, seeks a strongly loyal president to run the government day-to-day and to be a trusted ally who can ensure stability, amid manoeuvring over the eventual succession to his own position.\n\nUNCOMPROMISING STANCE\n\nJalili is an opponent of Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with major powers that was negotiated on the Iranian side by a group of pragmatic officials open to detente with the West.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump reneged on the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. With the possible return of Trump to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election and Jalili's possible election win, the deal's resurgence seems improbable.\n\nBefore the nuclear pact, Jalili served as Iran's top nuclear negotiator for five years from 2007, a period in which Tehran took a confrontational and uncompromising approach to discussions with global powers about its uranium enrichment programme.\n\nIn those years, three U.N. Security Council resolutions were imposed on Iran, and several attempts to resolve the dispute failed.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, Jalili was heavily criticised in debates on state TV by other candidates for his uncompromising nuclear stance and his opposition to Iran signing up to two conventions on financial crime recommended by the Financial Action Taskforce, an international crime watchdog.\n\nSome hardliners, like Jalili, argue that the acceptance of the Convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on Combating Transnational Organized Crime could hamper Iran's support for its paramilitary proxies across the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nPRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nJalili has been trying for the presidency for years. He finished third in the 2013 contest, and stood again in 2021 but eventually withdrew to support Raisi.\n\nBorn in the holy Muslim Shi'ite city of Mashhad in 1965, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1980s in fighting during the Iran-Iraq war and joined the Foreign Ministry in 1989. Despite his hardline views, he is outwardly soft-spoken.\n\nHe gained a doctorate in political science at Imam Sadiq University, a training ground for Iranian leaders, where he wrote a study entitled \"Foreign policy of (the) Prophet of Islam\", according to a biography that was for a time posted on the Foreign Ministry website for a time.\n\nFor four years from 2001, he worked at Khamenei's office.\n\nWhen hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, he chose Jalili to be his adviser, and within months made him deputy foreign minister.\n\nJalili was appointed in 2007 as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, a post that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator.",

And a police forensic official told Reuters the authorities believe the pistol remains on the streets.\n\nThe havoc attributed to a single firearm exemplifies the challenges for President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on an explosion of violent crime and homicides since 2020, fueled by a sharp increase in smuggled weapons during the same time, many of them from the United States. Ecuador recorded 7,994 murders last year, a nearly six-fold increase since 2020.\n\nReuters was the first media organization granted access to police bullet-tracing efforts, a key component in Ecuador's fight against crime. Tracing the origins of bullets and guns could help authorities choke off trafficking routes as well as build forensic histories of illegal weapons for future prosecutions, police said.\n\nBut it is slow work.\n\nOf the more than 40,000 guns seized since 2019, just 900 have been traced, Major Efrain Arguello, who heads a national forensic investigations unit, told Reuters.\n\nThe weapon used in Nueva Prosperina may belong to, or have been rented out, among five rival drug gangs fighting for control of the precinct, Arguello said.\n\nPolice are investigating killings, robberies and other violent incidents in connection with the same gun.\n\n\"A gun connected to 30 crimes means there isn't just an increase in trafficking, but in the circulation or internal sales of illicit guns,\" said Renato Rivera, the director of the Ecuadorean Organized Crime Observatory research group.\n\nThe Pacific port city of Guayaquil is a hub for drug trafficking and the scene of turf wars between Mexican, Albanian and other foreign cartels that have led to a sharp rise in homicides.\n\nNoboa in January designated 22 gangs - including the five operating in Nueva Prosperina - as terrorist organizations.\n\nSince taking office last November, after he was elected to finish out his predecessor's term, Noboa has increased funding for security forces by 6.6% to $3.52 billion.\n\nEQUIPMENT SHORTAGES\n\nBut two senior police officials told Reuters that Ecuador is struggling to choke off gun trafficking routes from the United States, Peru and other countries in the region because of a lack of funding, forensic equipment and trained personnel.\n\nEcuador has just eight microscopes in a country of 17 million for bullet tracing, police said, and 247 trained technicians.\n\n\"We are tracing with what we have,\" Arguello said.\n\nIn a small room in Quito's police forensic building, technician Jhony Tapia peered through the only ballistic microscope in the city at shell casings and bullets from five guns used to kill four people at a bar in the Amazon (NASDAQ: ).\n\nDistinctive markings from the firing pins of individual firearms, visible under a high power microscope, allow technicians to match bullets to guns or to other bullets fired from the same weapon.\n\n\"The firing pin leaves a mark that is more effective (for tracing) than a fingerprint,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Molina, head of the national police arms and explosives trafficking unit.\n\nTapia will spend the next several hours studying 126 shell casings of varying sizes, he told Reuters.\n\nHis findings will be checked against a national police database of bullets and shell casings.\n\nFinding a match is simpler if police also recover the gun, allowing technicians like Tapia to compare markings on the barrel, called rifling, with the marks left on bullets.\n\nSeized guns are checked against international databases run by the United States and Interpol.\n\nForensic staff did not say whether the guns in the Amazon case had been recovered.\n\nUnlike neighboring Colombia, which has fought drug trafficking networks for decades, Ecuador until recently was considered one of Latin America's safest countries - a popular destination for foreign tourists and retirees.\n\nBut after increased drug interdiction along Colombia's Pacific Coast, traffickers shifted their route to Ecuador and violent crime soared.\n\nEcuador's police have identified seven gun trafficking routes, Noboa's office said.\n\nThree run overland through Peru while a fourth route enters northern Ecuador near the border with Colombia, though police did not specify if the weapons came from there.\n\nGUN-TRAFFICKING ROUTES FROM THE U.S.\n\nThree more gun-trafficking routes originate in the United States: one by air from Miami to coastal Manta, another through Lima and then overland, and a third by sea via the storied Galapagos (NASDAQ: ) Islands, police and Noboa's office said.\n\nPolice said they have also found gun parts shipped by courier services from Miami or produced using 3-D printing.\n\nIn April police seized a 3-D printer in coastal Manabi province which they said was used to make up to 20 gun parts.\n\nPolice would not share estimates for the prices of illegal guns but the Ecuador Organized Crime Observatory said that Glocks and other pistols go for up to $4,000 new and $500 used.\n\nRifles can cost between $8,000 and $15,000, the research group said, while guns made with 3-D printers go for $3,000. There is also a market for homemade guns, it said.\n\nPolice seized nearly 10,000 guns across Ecuador last year, according to police data, more than half of them revolvers or pistols, close to double the number of seizures in 2019.\n\nAt least a quarter of the traced guns were legally acquired in the United States, but they generally have no record of legal entry to Ecuador, police said.\n\nAuthorities have also traced at least 36 guns that were legally exported from the United States to Peru and smuggled north into Ecuador, said Molina, the head of the arms trafficking unit.\n\nPeruvian authorities told Reuters they raided three companies moving guns on the black market in March and criminally charged 18 people.\n\nMolina said police were also looking into the possibility that Ecuadorean gangs could be trading cocaine for weapons from Mexican cartels.\n\nSince 2022, Ecuador has increased its co-operation with the United States to fight gun-running, gaining access to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) internet database eTrace.\n\nLast year the ATF conducted traces on over 500 firearms seized in Ecuador, the State Department and the ATF said in a joint statement, compared to fewer than 100 in 2021.\n\nYet some analysts say that without a specific plan to tackle arms trafficking, seizures of guns and munitions will remain a side show to drug busts.\n\n\"There is no process of intelligence monitoring to locate the providers and systems and get ahead of the arms trafficking,\" said former army intelligence chief and security analyst Mario Pazmino.\n\nNoboa's office said security forces had had a number of successes against the gun traffickers, including the seizure of 2,291 guns since the president's declaration of war on gangs in January.",

        "title": "All Systems Go For Crane, As Execution And A Growth Pivot Drive A Major Re-Rating (NYSE:CR)",
        "body": "Hramovnick/iStock via Getty Images\n\nI\u2019m not sure I could have asked for much more than what Crane (NYSE:CR) has done since it announced it was splitting Crane and Crane NXT (NXT). Not only did I like that decision, I\u2019ve really liked management\u2019s pivot toward growth opportunities in Process Flow (or PF), it\u2019s new M&A program, and I feel like the messaging to the Street has been on point, not to mention the execution.\n\nThe market has noticed, sending the shares over 60% higher since my last update, handily beating the broader industrial sector and just about any like-for-like rival you care to mention.\n\nI\u2019m clearly a big fan of what management is doing here, and I think a more growth-oriented PF segment and the underlying market growth opportunities in Aerospace and Electronics (or AE) can drive mid-single-digit organic growth and meaningful margin leverage. A lot is already expected in that valuation, though, and while I do see enough reasons to stay positive, this is no longer a hidden gem type of story.\n\nPivoting To Growth And Margins In PF\n\nOnce a somewhat sleep and cyclical fluid handling business (valves, pumps, specialty pipe, et al), Crane has put a fair bit of work into repositioning the PF business toward better growth and margin opportunities. Businesses with more cyclicality, less impressive secular growth potential, and less willingness to pay up for innovation (like oil/gas, energy, and non-residential buildings) have been deprioritized, and management has been getting more active on pricing to better align prices with the value of the offerings.\n\nOn the growth side, Crane is targeting markets like LNG, hydrogen, pharma, water, automation, and what I would call \u201csustainable chemicals\u201d \u2013 chemicals made with different inputs or processes to reduce their carbon footprint and/or use or reduce waste streams.\n\nOpportunities in hydrogen are fairly straightforward, as more industries look to replace traditional fossil fuel inputs with hydrogen, this business should continue to grow (steel companies, for instance, are starting to look into hydrogen and this could drive major growth). Should hydrogen become more relevant in mobility (more likely trucks and trains than passenger vehicles), there\u2019s even more upside. Management has already done a couple of deals to boost its capabilities in hydrogen (not unlike what Dover (DOV) did a little while ago), and this is a credible growth market.\n\nI\u2019m also curious to see what the company will do in areas like pharma and possibly electronics down the line. Management has been developing products with higher specifications to handle the more exacting needs of biologicals (antibodies, et al) production, including recent expansion into products for antibody drug conjugate production, and I think a greater focus on high-spec systems could eventually pave the way to get more involved in electronics as well.\n\nIn the meantime, trends are mixed. As I said in that last article, I expected headwinds in 2024 from end-markets like chemicals, general industrial, non-residential, and pharma, and that\u2019s what has been happening, pushing Crane\u2019s organic growth here to modest contraction in the last two quarters. Orders and backlog are still growing, though, and I think Crane will be fine in 2025.\n\nAE Offers Long-Term Opportunity Beyond Near-Term Noise\n\nAerospace has been one of the hot end-markets in the industrial sector for some time, with many companies (I\u2019m thinking of Eaton (ETN) and Parker Hannifin (PH) among others) spending significant sums on M&A to position themselves for what should be a decade-long run of production growth and then years of high-margin aftermarket sales afterward. Crane is more than just a participant here, and this should be a significant growth driver for years to come.\n\nWhile the long-term aero story remains strong, there have been concerns of late about the near-term risk of further production delays and shortfalls as Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) and Boeing (BA) deal with various issues that are very likely to lead to 2024 production coming in below prior targets. In the case of Crane, though, there really isn\u2019t much risk here \u2013 when near-term production stumbles, Crane can easily shift most of its products from the original equipment market to the aftermarket, where it enjoys higher prices and margins anyway. With narrowbody production disappointing, more older jets have had to remain in service, driving strong aftermarket demand for Crane, Melrose (OTCPK:MLSPF), and others in the market.\n\nOn a related note, I like how Crane takes a platform-agnostic approach to its aerospace product development. There are risks in not partnering on pre-specified programs, but Crane management understates its markets and what its customers need, and this makes the company less tied to specific wins (and/or shortfalls in production of specific aircraft) and less vulnerable on margins, as OEMs will often squeeze suppliers hard for first-fit products.\n\nOriginal equipment sales have been picking up lately, but aftermarket remains very strong and margins continue to grow nicely here (over 22% on a segment level last quarter). With multiple defense programs ramping up (including radar, missile, and aircraft programs), improving narrowbody production, and the real expansion in widebody production still to come, I think management\u2019s target of 7% to 9% growth in aerospace is definitely achievable over the next three to five years.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nWith multiyear strength in aerospace and new growth markets in process flow, I think Crane can grow revenue at a strong mid-single-digit organic pace. This is going to be complemented by an active M&A program, with the company so far sticking to its target of one meaningful deal per quarter (two of which are relevant to emerging opportunities like hydrogen and pharma).\n\nSeeing a few quarters of execution and understanding more about what management is looking to do as it pivots to sustainably higher-margin market opportunities, I\u2019m more confident in that 23% EBITDA margin target for 2028, and I think a 20% EBITDA margin in or before 2026 is pretty likely. With that, I see free cash flow margins moving fairly quickly toward the mid-teens, and there could be some further upside there.\n\nThe problem is that the market already expects that and then some. It\u2019s tricky to model in M&A, but in the case of Crane you pretty much have to or the numbers just don\u2019t work. I\u2019m comfortable with the idea that Crane will see actual reported revenue growth in the double-digits on the back of M&A, but that hardly makes for conservative modeling.\n\nValuation isn\u2019t any simpler with my margin and return-driven EV/EBITDA methodology. Crane\u2019s improving profitability can support an above-average EBITDA multiple, but even a 15x multiple (which includes some credit for above-average top-line growth potential, which the market does reward), I can\u2019t get to an attractive fair value this way.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCrane is a good litmus test for how much an investor emphasizes valuation over story and improving fundamentals. It takes some aggressive assumptions to support a fair value in the $160\u2019s (my discounted cash flow-based fair value estimate), but Crane appears to have an above-average sustainable multiyear growth story, and the market has shown over and over again it will pay for above-average revenue growth and margin leverage.\n\nThere are more risks here now because of the valuation, and I\u2019m more inclined to wait for a pullback, but it\u2019s hard to argue with a company that is delivering beat-and-raise performances and outlining a path to higher sustained growth and margin levels in the years to come.",

        "title": "OFG Bancorp: Taking The More Cautious Route (NYSE:OFG)",
        "body": "Fly View Productions\n\nOne of the more interesting banks that I have come across over the past year or so has been OFG Bancorp (NYSE:OFG). For those not familiar with the company, it is a bank holding company that provides banking, wealth management, and treasury services to its clients. While most banks by this point in time have adopted some digital offerings, management boasts that this particular business is truly \u2018digital first\u2019. As a testament to this, management has provided investors with some interesting data points. For instance, 94% of all routine transactions, 96% of all deposit transactions, and 64% of all loan payments on the retail side are conducted through digital/self-service channels. In the most recent quarter, the company boasted digital enrollment figures that were 12% higher than they were the same time one year earlier. And in fact, digital loan payments were up 68%, while virtual teller utilization had grown by 32%.\n\nTo be perfectly honest with you, it's this emphasis that I did not give enough credit to when I last wrote about the company. Back in September of 2023, I acknowledged that the firm had recovered nicely from the banking crisis that began earlier that year. But I felt as though shares were priced at levels that did not justify further upside. That caused me to rate the business a \u2018hold\u2019 to reflect my view that shares would be unlikely to outperform the broader market for the foreseeable future. But ultimately, the stock did outperform, generating upside of 31.5% at a time when the S&P 500 is up 27%. Today, I do have a more bullish view about the company. But this doesn't mean that I am ready to upgrade just yet.\n\nDigging in\n\nPerhaps the best place to start when it comes to OFG Bancorp would be on the deposit side of things. This is the one area of the business that I'm still not keen on. During the most recent quarter, management reported deposits of $9.55 billion. Although that's a hefty sum of change, it's actually lower than the $9.76 billion the company reported at the end of 2023. Having said that, it is quite a bit higher than the $8.57 billion in deposits that the institution had at the end of 2022. Even though the drop is unfortunate to see, if we exclude brokered deposits and focus only on core deposits, then the decline was much smaller, from $9.60 billion to $9.55 billion. Even so, a decline is a decline. Add on top of this the fact that uninsured deposits now account for 51% of total deposits, a number that is up from 42.8% when I last wrote about the firm, and this is a part of the enterprise that I still don't like.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nEven though there was a decline in deposits, the firm has seen the value of loans on its books increase. As of the end of the most recent quarter, loans totaled $7.41 billion. That's up from the $7.40 billion in loans that the company had at the end of 2023. And it's an increase over the $6.72 billion reported in 2022. With the growth in deposits, you might expect a growth in other securities. But that was not the case.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nToday, securities total about $2.48 billion. That's down slightly from the $2.69 billion reported one year earlier. During this time, it is worth noting that cash and cash equivalents increased. But the rise from $748.2 million to $754.4 million was not enough to account for the decline in securities. As disappointing as the drop in the value of deposits and securities has been, one positive thing about the institution is that debt has remained roughly flat. At the end of the most recent quarter, debt came in at $200.8 million. That's exactly where it was at the end of 2023. But it is up from the $27 million reported at the end of 2022.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nOne really good thing about OFG Bancorp is that its net interest margin is quite high. Many of the banks that I see have net interest margins ranging between 2% and 4%. But in the most recent quarter, our candidate had a reading of 5.40%. Unfortunately, that was down from the 5.89% reported one year earlier. However, that was not enough to offset the overall expansion in the company's balance sheet that allowed its net interest income to rise from $126.5 million to $129 million. Noninterest income also grew, rising from $28.9 million to $30.3 million. Combined, these two made it possible for net profits to grow from $46.2 million to $49.7 million.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nGiven how early it is in the 2024 fiscal year, it might just be best to value the company using results from 2023. Doing so, we get a price to earnings multiple of only 9.3. This is actually in the range of what I typically like to see in banks. Normally, a price to earnings multiple of between 6 and 10 is desirable. In the chart above, you can see how OFG Bancorp stacks up against five similar banks. Only one of the five ended up being cheaper than it on a price to earnings basis. There are, of course, other ways to value a bank. In the chart above, you can see the price to book multiple and the price to tangible book multiple, not only for our candidate, but for the same five firms that I valued it against on a price to earnings basis. On a price to book basis, four of the five firms were cheaper than OFG Bancorp. But this number drops to two of the five when looking at the picture through the lens of the price to tangible book multiple.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nWe should also be paying attention to asset quality. A bank can make sense to trade at a premium if asset quality is high. And if asset quality is low, it can deserve to trade at a discount. In the first chart below, you can see the return on assets for OFG Bancorp, as well as for the five companies I am comparing it to. With a reading of 1.66%, OFG Bancorp ended up boasting a return on assets that is greater than four of the five firms I have it stacked up against. In the subsequent chart, you can see the same thing when it came to the return on equity of the institution. The 16.08% boasted by OFG Bancorp is awfully high. The company is so profitable, in fact, that earlier this year management announced a new $50 million share buyback program.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nTakeaway\n\nTo be perfectly honest with you, while preparing this article and writing it, I was very close to upgrading OFG Bancorp. It occurred to me that I did not give enough weight to the quality of its assets and relative valuation when considering the institution previously. However, I don't like seeing a drop in deposits and I really don't like seeing high and growing levels of uninsured deposit exposure. Had these not been an issue, I think an upgrade would have been warranted. But given the downside associated with both of these metrics, I don't think it's wrong to be a bit more cautious.",

        "title": "Prediction: This Move From Nvidia in the Second Half Will Be Much Bigger Than the Stock Split",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared over the past few years, and the stock added to gains in recent times when it announced something a lot of investors had been waiting for: a stock split. The company decided to launch a 10-for-1 split to bring its shares down to a level that would make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy. These operations involve the issuance of more shares to current holders to make that happen.\n\nPrior to the operation, Nvidia surged to more than $1,000 a share -- a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors and a difficult buy for those aiming to take a small position. Now, with Nvidia shares trading around $120, these problems have disappeared. So, though stock splits aren't catalysts for share performance, they can represent a positive move for a company.\n\nBut Nvidia's big moves this year aren't over. In fact, Nvidia has something major planned for the second half. My prediction is this move from the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant will be much bigger than the stock split -- and offer you a great reason to buy the stock. Let's check out what's ahead.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's lower per-share price\n\nOf course, gaining access to Nvidia for a lower per-share price, thanks to the stock split, is exciting, but it's important to remember that splits don't change a company's valuation: Nvidia isn't any cheaper today than it was prior to the split. In fact, a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental.\n\nThis upcoming move, however, will. First, a bit of background. Nvidia already is the world's AI chip leader, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) holding 80% share of the market. This is because Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, powering critical AI tasks like training and inferencing -- the processes that help large language models do their job of solving complex tasks.\n\nNvidia also sells a variety of related AI products and services that make it the go-to destination for those launching an AI project. All of this has helped the company increase revenue and net income in the triple digits quarter after quarter.\n\nNow, moving along to my prediction: Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and best chip yet is much bigger news for the company and could represent a significant catalyst for the stock in the near term as well as over time as this platform adds to revenue.\n\nBlackwell could be a game changer because it represents a whole new way of powering AI, achieving incredible performance at a cost and energy consumption that's as much as 25 times lower than Hopper, the previous system. This is a critical feature because this savings reduces an AI customer's overall costs, potentially making the Nvidia system the most economical choice over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackwell's game-changing innovations\n\nBlackwell includes six transformative innovations, including the world's most powerful chip; the next generation Nvidia NVLink to offer high-speed communication among as many as 576 GPUs; a system of preventative maintenance to maximize system function; and more. And the Blackwell GPU offers as much as four-times-faster training and 30-times-faster inference than Nvidia's current leading chip, the H100.\n\nAnd now the really good news is this: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into next year. The launch strategy, making Blackwell available in more than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems, could ensure a strong start. All of this is reason to be optimistic about the platform's debut and its contribution to revenue in the coming quarters.\n\nThe Blackwell launch also may reassure investors who worry about rivals taking market share from the chip giant because it should set Nvidia significantly ahead.\n\nSo, even though Nvidia made headlines for its stock split in recent times, the upcoming launch of Blackwell is much bigger news -- and news that could help this already top-performing AI stock continue its gains in the second half and beyond. And that makes Nvidia a great buy now, even after its 150% increase in the first half of the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy and Hold Apple Stock Forever",
        "body": "Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been around a while and has delivered market-crushing returns over its long and storied history. However, some investors and analysts now feel it's no longer worth investing in the iPhone maker. The market cap now tops $3 trillion, which limits its upside potential, especially since Apple's biggest moneymaker -- the iPhone -- no longer generates the kind of year-over-year growth in sales that it once did.\n\nWhile these are fair concerns, there remain solid reasons to buy Apple's shares and hold onto them for good. Let's consider three such reasons.\n\n1. Apple's culture of innovation\n\nHow does a company remain relevant for decades? It's generally not enough to offer necessary products or services. Even in industries such as healthcare, corporations need to innovate constantly to avoid becoming dinosaurs. That's also true -- and arguably more so -- in the tech industry where Apple operates. The company has stayed relevant and thriving for as long as it has largely because it's created a culture centered around innovation.\n\nApple doesn't need to be first to market. It expertly takes existing products and adds its own spin to them. That's what it did with the iPhone and many other technologies. More recently, the company finally announced its artificial intelligence (AI) plans: It will add various AI functionalities to eligible devices (including the iPhone 15 Pro and beyond). While some observers worried that Apple was getting behind in the AI race, the company has made a meaningful move.\n\nNo doubt there will be more to come. Beyond AI, Apple pours plenty of money into research and development (R&D) to avoid becoming a dinosaur -- and, in fact, to remain highly relevant for a long time, just as it has throughout its history. That's an excellent reason to consider the stock.\n\n2. An incredibly deep ecosystem\n\nApple's success has paid off in many ways, one of which is that it now boasts a deep ecosystem of devices and customers who use at least one of them; more than 2 billion Apple devices are in circulation. It's difficult to overstate the value of this base of customers.\n\nThe company knows it, too -- that's why it's ramping up its services segment, through which it offers a variety of services including Apple Music and Apple TV. Apple has more than 1 billion active paid subscriptions.\n\nHere's another perk of Apple's strategy to increasingly rely on services: While making and selling hardware is a relatively low-margin business, the opposite is true for the services it offers to its vast base of customers. So, over time, there's a good chance that gross and profit margins will improve. That's great for the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's true that the services unit still doesn't provide a substantial portion of its top line. In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (which ended March 30), Apple's services revenue came in at $23.9 billion, about 14% higher than the year-ago period.\n\nApple's total sales of $90.8 billion dropped by about 4% year over year, so services accounted for only roughly 26% of total sales. But that number has generally grown over the years -- it was just 10% in the third quarter of 2015. This trend bodes well for Apple's long-term prospects.\n\n3. Apple's competitive advantages\n\nThough Apple benefits from a deep ecosystem, can it keep most of its customers? Thanks to its competitive advantages, it should be able to do so. Apple's business benefits from the network effect, switching costs, and a strong brand name, all of which are important sources of a competitive edge.\n\nApple's network effect can be seen in its App Store: The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes to developers, and vice versa. That's the hallmark of the network effect: The value of services increases with use.\n\nApple's devices also have features that other smartphones or tablets don't have, making communication between Apple-centric devices extremely convenient. Leaving the ecosystem means leaving these behind, hence the switching costs.\n\nLastly, Apple routinely ranks as one of the most valuable brand names in the world. These features make it likely that its business remains solid despite stiff competition.\n\nBuy and forget\n\nLike every company, Apple faces headwinds; a decline in iPhone sales in China and antitrust lawsuits both come to mind. However, the company has more than enough going its way to appeal to investors, including an excellent dividend program. So, if you're interested, look past Apple's recent struggles and consider sticking with the company for good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Walmart Is a Rock-Solid Dividend King, but So Is This High-Yield Dividend Stock That's Down 11% in the Past 3 Months",
        "body": "With the spotlight on artificial intelligence (AI) and megacap growth stocks, it's easy to overlook the impressive run-up in stable stalwarts like Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Soaring just shy of 30% year to date, Walmart is the best-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- outpacing gains from Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and other growth stocks. What's more, Walmart has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years -- making it a Dividend King.\n\nWalmart has a clear plan for growing earnings and increasing its dividend -- but the stock has gotten more expensive and the yield is just 1.2%.\n\nTool and outdoor products maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) is also a Dividend King. But the stock is down over 10% in the last three months and a painful 57% over the last three years. Here's why Stanley Black & Decker is out of favor, how it is turning things around, and why it is worth buying now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA primer on Stanley Black & Decker\n\nStanley Black & Decker sells various hand tools, power tools, and accessories under brands like DeWalt, Stanley, Black+Decker, Craftsman, and others.\n\nA whopping $13.4 billion or 85% of 2023 revenue came from its tools and outdoor segment, while just $2.4 billion came from its industrial business-to-business (B2B) segment. Sixty-two percent of 2023 sales were generated in the U.S. As such, the company has been heavily impacted by inflation, higher interest rates, weak consumer spending, and a challenged housing market. Meanwhile, other industrial companies that primarily engage in B2B sales -- such as General Electric and Siemens -- are hovering around all-time highs.\n\nPeaks and valleys\n\nStanley Black & Decker has been on a roller coaster over the last few years. It achieved all-time high net income of $1.69 billion in 2021, only to lose a record $311 million in 2023. The following chart paints this dramatic picture well.\n\nSWK Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nYou may be wondering how a company can go from a period of growth and expansion to a period of weakness in just a few years. The short answer is that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the toolmaker's business, disrupting supply chains and consumer behavior. Initially, Stanley Black & Decker benefited from a surge in goods spending, which is reflected in its 2021 results. But by 2022, it became clear that demand was merely pulled forward by a few years and that the boom was unsustainable.\n\nStanley Black & Decker's operating expenses increased to keep up with demand. But when demand fell, and revenue began to decline, those higher expenses ate away at margins. In 2023, Stanley Black & Decker had an operating margin barely over 4% compared to a pre-pandemic range of about 12% to 14% -- illustrating how inefficient the business has become.\n\nStory continues\n\nSWK Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nGetting back on track\n\nThe company has implemented a massive cost-cutting effort to restore margins -- with a goal of reaching an adjusted gross margin of 35% over the long term and 30% for full-year 2024. Stanley Black & Decker achieved $145 million in pre-tax cost savings last quarter, bringing its aggregate cost savings to $1.2 billion since the program was launched in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTo its credit, Stanley Black & Decker has stayed on track toward hitting its goals. When it first announced the program, it was guiding for $1 billion in pre-tax savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion in savings within three years. During its first-quarter 2024 earnings call, Stanley Black & Decker said it was still targeting $1.5 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nReducing inventory has been another focus for the company. Stanley Black & Decker is forecasting $400 million to $500 million in inventory reductions for the full year and capital expenditures of just $400 million to $500 million. Reducing inventory and keeping a tight lid on spending should help the company reach its free-cash-flow (FCF) goal of $600 million to $800 million for the full year. That's still a way off from the $1.08 billion in FCF the company earned in full year 2019, which is a good benchmark considering it's before the pandemic disrupted its business.\n\nA high yield with a (potentially) inexpensive valuation\n\n2024 FCF guidance would allow Stanley Black & Decker to cover its dividend with FCF. In the recent quarter, Stanley Black & Decker paid $121.8 billion in dividends. Over the last couple of years, it has made minimum $0.01-per-share-per-quarter dividend raises to retain its status as a Dividend King -- which is understandable given the business is undergoing a turnaround. Therefore, investors should expect minimum raises over the next few years as well, meaning the annual dividend expense should be under $500 billion for 2024 and 2025.\n\nA lower stock price paired with a moderately higher dividend has pole-vaulted Stanley Black & Decker's yield to 3.8% -- which is significantly higher than the 2% or so yield investors were getting pre-pandemic.\n\nSWK Dividend Yield Chart\n\nGiven its net loss in 2023, Stanley Black & Decker currently has a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, analyst estimates reflect the impact of its cost-cutting efforts and a return to profitability. Average analyst estimates call for $4 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.48 in 2025 EPS. Based on the 2025 EPS guidance, Stanley Black & Decker would have a P/E ratio of just 15.5 -- which is dirt cheap for a Dividend King. However, a lot could go wrong between now and when that full-year 2025 figure rolls in -- so investors shouldn't bank on analyst estimates.\n\nStanley Black & Decker is worth the wait\n\nStanley Black & Decker poorly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and interest rates. And the stock price reflects these mistakes -- as it is just 15% or so off its 10-year low. However, the company has been doing a good job over the last seven quarters by sticking to its cost-cutting plan.\n\nIn the near term, Stanley Black & Decker's FCF projections indicate confidence that it can support its dividend with cash. Over the medium term, a return to profitability and earnings growth makes the stock look like a good value.\n\nEven as the business recovers, investors shouldn't expect the company to drastically increase its dividend or buy back stock. The balance sheet has weakened in recent years due to higher debt. S&P Global's June 20 annual review of the company gave it an A- credit rating, which is good but could be improved.\n\nAt times like this, it's important to zoom out and think about where a business will be three to five years from now. If Stanley Black & Decker can return to its pre-pandemic form and chart a path toward growth, the valuation and yield will make the stock look too cheap to ignore. Patient investors may want to scoop up shares of the Dividend King now, while others may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to ensure Stanley Black & Decker can effectively operate under a leaner business model.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Stanley Black & Decker right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Stanley Black & Decker, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Stanley Black & Decker wasn\u2019t one of them.

(PowerSchool) (NYSE: PWSC) buyout by Bain Capital.\n\n\n\nIf you invested in PowerSchool, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/powerschool-holdings-inc-investigation.\n\nWhy is PowerSchool being Investigated by BFA Law?\n\nOn June 7, 2024, PowerSchool publicly announced that it entered into a merger agreement to be acquired by Bain Capital, pursuant to which PowerSchool shareholders will receive $22.80 per share in cash. Minority shareholders will have no voice in the transaction because PowerSchool's controlling shareholders Vista Equity Partners (Vista) and Onex Partners Manager LP (Onex) have already approved the merger agreement by written consent.\n\nPowerSchool is controlled by Vista and Onex through their collective ownership of over 70% of PowerSchool's stock. According to the merger announcement, Vista and Onex will rollover a portion of their equity investment in the post-close company. BFA Law is currently investigating whether the rollover of Vista and Onex resulted in Bain Capital offering an unfair price to acquire PowerSchool. The issue is especially relevant given the merger price of $22.80 per share in cash is far lower than analyst price targets, which are as high as $31.\n\nBFA Law is concerned that Vista and Onex, as well as members of PowerSchool's board of directors, may have breached their fiduciary duties in approving an unfair merger transaction for the benefit of the controlling stockholders.\n\nShareholders are encouraged to submit your information to find out about your rights.\n\nSubmit your information here: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/powerschool-holdings-inc-investigation\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIf you currently own shares of PowerSchool, you may have legal options and are encouraged to contact the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

        "body": "Central banks have been actively and massively buying gold over the last few years. In its report published this week, UBS highlighted the sustained interest in gold by central banks, underscoring its role as a hedge against inflation, a diversifier during market stress, and a credible asset in times of economic turmoil.\n\nIn the wake of the Ukraine war and the freezing of approximately $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings, central banks, particularly those from smaller countries vulnerable to Western sanctions, have increased their gold reserves.\n\nThis trend, while not immediately impacting the dollar-based status quo, signals a shift in the perception of central bank sovereignty and adds to calls for reform in the international financial system.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, central bank holdings of gold stood at around 37,000 metric tons, representing 16.7% of total central bank foreign exchange reserves. Developed countries hold the largest reserves, with the United States, Germany, Italy, and France at the forefront.\n\nNevertheless, emerging markets are rapidly accumulating gold, with notable increases by Russia and China, UBS strategists said.\n\nThese purchases are part of a broader move to diversify assets and reduce reliance on major currencies such as the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and British pound.\n\nThe World Gold Council's survey of reserve managers indicated that gold's long-term value, its role as an inflation hedge, and the lack of counterparty risks are key reasons for its inclusion in reserves. Moreover, gold's daily liquidity and absence of default risk are crucial amid rising public debts.\n\nDiscrepancies in reported gold purchases between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources like Metals Focus highlight the sensitive nature of reserve disclosures and the likely underreporting of gold acquisitions by sovereign wealth funds.\n\nHistorical patterns suggest that central bank actions can significantly influence gold prices. Comparing current dynamics to the mid-1960s, when central banks sold gold to maintain the gold standard, today's market is more liquid and diverse.\n\n\"Looking ahead, demand for gold has solid support from central banks. An additional factor over the next few years could be our outlook for a weaker US dollar. Central banks in emerging market tend to intervene in currency markets when their currency appreciates against the US dollar,\" UBS said.\n\n\"With emerging market central banks potentially increasing their foreign currency holdings as result of interventions in the currency market, there could be a greater need to buy even more gold.\"\n\nUBS maintains a positive outlook on gold, citing central bank demand, geopolitical tensions, high inflation, and potentially lower US interest rates as supportive factors.\n\nThe Swiss brokerage firm expects gold prices to reach $2,600 per ounce by the end of the year and $2,700 per ounce by mid-2025, recommending a 5% gold allocation in a USD-based balanced portfolio for individual investors.",

        "body": "NEW YORK, June 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath (NYSE: ), Inc. (UiPath or the Company) (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.\n\n\n\nInvestors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the Class Period). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702.\n\nIf you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.\n\nWhat is the Lawsuit About?\n\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality, asserted that our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum, and that there's no doubt there's [been] better execution since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.\n\nThese statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused confusion among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.\n\nOn May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate execution strategy to scale the Company's AI-powered growth products to reach their full potential, and that AI had create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers. Ui Path also described how the investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs while experiencing contract execution challenges on large deals.\n\nThis news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you. Shareholders are not responsible for any court costs or expenses of litigation. The Firm will seek court approval for any potential fees and expenses.
