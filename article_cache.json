        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

Mario Tama | Getty Images\n\nwatch now\n\nAir traffic, extreme weather The Federal Aviation Administration has found a shortage of up to 3,000 needed air traffic controllers. Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination. Based on air traffic patterns and airport density, New York City and Florida are subject to the highest risk of backups. The massive heat wave across the U.S. was a peek at the kind of extreme weather that can lead to travel issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects disruptive weather for the holiday week, with storms across the Midwest and East Coast, and continuing dangerous heat in the Southwest and interior Northeast. Extreme temperatures cause technical failures that result in delays. High heat creates thin air, which hampers the plane's thrust for takeoff and ascent. That means airplanes need more runway for takeoff or a lighter aircraft \u2014 by removing baggage or passengers. And it means that very high temperatures increase the risk of flight cancellations. The best bet to avoid this risk is to take early morning and late-night flights. Good news to reduce travel anxiety If travelers prepare and secure backup plans, they can make the best out of the busy summer season. And despite travel anxiety and a cascade of uncertain factors, travel expert and managing editor at The Points Guy, Clint Henderson, says airlines and airports are so far showing signs of being better prepared than past years. Despite May issues and despite some airlines pulling back on overall hiring plans compared to past years, in part due to Boeing delays, Henderson said, \"We have not seen the major meltdowns that we saw a couple of years ago. And I think part of the reason for that is the airlines and the airports, and everyone from Uber to rental car companies, you know, you name it, everyone staffed back up.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nUnited Airlines has projected a 7% increase in flyers from the 2023 Independence Day week, and is adapting with new staff. American Airlines is slated for 10% more summer departures year over year. Improvements in coordination for air traffic controllers are also taking place. \"The federal government and local ATC towers have been working together better, and that includes the military. They've opened up military airspace to help accommodate the crowd, so we have seen snarls,\" Henderson said. \"There is still a shortage of air traffic controllers, but it hasn't led to the worst outcomes that we were expecting when we were talking about the shortage of air traffic control workers even a year ago.\" That said, he warns that in severe weather, a shortage of air traffic control may still worsen delays for travelers. Tips for Independence Day travel With lower-than-expected prices, many more flyers this summer are infrequent flyers, who should start by signing up for airline apps which may offer them some introductory benefits, starting with miles and extending to free WiFi on some flights. Henderson said the easiest ways to save hours of wait times include signing up for programs that offer passengers faster movement through security, including TSA PreCheck and Clear, as well as the no-application-required Mobile Passport Control app, which allows users to go through an expedited U.S. Customs lane. He also recommended the \"Flighty\" tracker app, or similar flight tracker, to stay on top of options in the event flight status changes. Flyers need to also stay on top of the routes that the planes they plan to take are already traveling on, to catch issues at other airports which could ultimately cause a cascade of cancellations. \"If your flight gets canceled, you're competing with all those people on that plane to get on the next available flight. So if you have a head start on those people, you're going to be the winner,\" Henderson said. When it comes to traveling during peak season, \"Information is power,\" he said. Cheaper airfares may not be here to stay Airfares are down, but many factors influence price, from the specific destination of a traveler, with wide variation in prices depending on route, to how far in advance tickets are purchased, midweek travel versus weekend dates, and what additional fees (e.g. baggage) may push up the total cost of travel significantly. In addition, with issues lingering in the supply of new planes, from Boeing production being curtailed by the FAA to Airbus running into supply chain snafus, the recent dip in fares may not last too long. Henderson eventually expects price hikes from airlines related to increasing maintenance costs and reduced fleet capacity. Labor costs and fuel costs per flight skyrocketed in the past year. With production delays, airlines pay billions to fly less fuel-efficient and more costly and aged jets. Technical issues are more common on older plans and increase delays as well. On June 26, Southwest Airlines cut its second-quarter revenue forecast while citing booking concerns. The firm announced a decline in expected revenue per seat per mile, and fuel costs increasing up to 7.5% year over year. But for now, even with rising costs, flight prices have yet to return to their summer 2023 peaks, and consumers are taking advantage. Henderson said many last-minute travel deals that airlines are offering this summer are still available. Even if the security lines are long, prices on many routes should not weigh travelers down. Hopefully, neither will delays and cancellations.",

        "body": "Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.\n\nDemocrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.\n\n\"Yes, it was a bad performance,\" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.\"\n\nThe South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,\" Clyburn said.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.\n\nDespite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.\n\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.\n\nA poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.\n\nBut those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.\n\n\"I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,\" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. \"Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.\"\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.\n\nUltimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.\n\nBiden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.\n\nIn the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.\n\nMunoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.",

        "body": "In this article D\n\nSO\n\nNEE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThe sun sets behind power lines near homes during a heat wave in Los Angeles, Sept. 6, 2022. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe largest utility companies in the U.S. are warning that the nation is facing a surge of electricity demand unlike anything seen in decades, and failure to rapidly increase power generation could jeopardize the nation's economy. After a more than decade-long period of largely flat growth, electricity demand is poised to skyrocket by 2030 as the artificial intelligence revolution, the expansion of chip manufacturing, and the electrification of the vehicle fleet all coincide as the U.S. is trying to address climate change. The tech sector's build out of data centers to support AI and the adoption of electric vehicles alone is expected to add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, according to a report released by the consulting firm Rystad Energy this week. The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad. \"This growth is a race against time to expand power generation without overwhelming electricity systems to the point of stress,\" said Surya Hendry, a Rystad analyst, in a release following the report's publication.\n\n'The stakes are really, really high'\n\nThe major tech players \u2013 Amazon , Alphabet's Google unit, Microsoft and Meta \u2013 are urgently requesting more power as they bring data centers online that in some cases require a gigawatt of electricity, said Petter Skantze, vice president of infrastructure development at NextEra Energy Resources. To put that in context, a gigawatt is equivalent to the capacity of nuclear reactor. NextEra Energy , parent of Skantze's subsidiary, is the largest power company in the S&P utilities sector by market capitalization and it operates the biggest portfolio of renewable energy assets in the nation. \"This is a different urgency coming. They need this load to drive the next iteration of growth,\" Skantze told the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference in New York City this week. \"They're showing up now at the utility and they're banging on the door and they're saying I need to put this resource on the grid,\" the executive said.\n\nA big challenge will be whether enough resources are available to connect those large data center projects to the power grid, Skantze said. The stakes are high for the U.S. economy, the executive said. \"If I can't get that power capacity online, I cannot do the data center. I cannot do the manufacturing. I can't grow the core businesses of some of the largest corporations in the country,\" Skantze said. \"The stakes are really, really high. This is a new environment. We have to get this right.\" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors earlier this month that U.S. power demand will increase by 38% over the next two decades, a fourfold increase over the annual rate of growth in the previous 20 years. NextEra expects much of the demand to be met by renewables and battery storage, Ketchum said. The company has a 300-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and storage projects.\n\n'Energy security brings national security'\n\nSouthern Company , the second-largest utility in the U.S. by market cap, is also seeing a historic wave of electricity demand. The power company is headquartered in Atlanta, one of the fastest growing data center markets in the U.S. with 723 gigawatts under construction in 2023, up 211% over the prior year, according to real estate services firm CBRE. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack said the company is seeing a level of demand not seen since the advent of air conditioning and heat pumps in the South in the 1970s and 1980s. The utility is expecting demand to grow by three or four times, he said. \"A lot of this is dependent and contingent upon what we see with artificial intelligence and all those large learning models and what data centers will consume,\" Womack said. \"You're also seeing in the Southeast, this incredible population growth and you're seeing all this onshoring with manufacturing.\" Supplying the demand with reliable power is a matter of economic and national security, Womack said. Southern expects 80% of the demand through the end of the decade to be met by renewables, he said.",

        "body": "Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.\n\nAmazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.\n\nStarting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.\n\nTwo people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.\n\nMatt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.\n\nAWS confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley, and said that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years. A company spokesperson called AWS the leader in cloud \"by a wide margin,\" adding that over 280,000 startups run on AWS, including 96% of \"unicorns\" in AI and machine learning.\n\n\"These new programs are simply us doubling down on this incredible momentum,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.\n\nBut Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.\n\nAmazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.\n\nLast month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft \"ran laps around\" AWS in generative AI.\n\nStartups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIn November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.\n\nStartups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.\n\nIn addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. \"Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,\" Adept said in a blog post.\n\nAWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021.\n\nWATCH: AWS will boost investments in Singapore's cloud infrastructure by $9 billion",

The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.\n\n\"We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,\" West told CNBC.\n\nBandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.\n\nGiven the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are \"investing in themselves,\" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.\n\nAnd, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.\n\nAmong them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.\n\nAfter winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project.

        "title": "Move over, remote jobs. CEOs say borderless talent is the future of tech work",
        "body": "To work remotely or not is no longer the question. Experts say it's borderless hiring for technology roles that is stealing the conversation.\n\n\"Remote is like the gateway drug to borderless,\" said Jeremy Johnson, CEO of AI-enabled tech talent marketplace Andela, whose customers include Goldman Sachs, Github and Coursera. \"Once you realize that you don't have to all be in the same office five days a week in order to build a compelling culture and feel connected to the mission and solve complex problems, you then start thinking there are great people all over the world.\"\n\nWith tech leaders focusing concurrently on innovation and value-driven efficiency, tech hiring that eclipses national or even global time zone delineation is a growing phenomenon. Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey. By 2022, the tech talent workforce in cities like Beijing and Delhi far outweighed that of U.S. powerhouses like San Francisco and New York, reports CBRE Global Tech Talent Guidebook 2024. The report cites burgeoning tech talent markets like Bucharest, Romania; Cape Town, South Africa; Cebu City, Philippines; Nairobi, Kenya and more.\n\nGlobal hiring is an example of a luxury that's moving down the value chain, Johnson said. Much like services such as Uber increased access to what is essentially a private driver on demand, talent marketplaces and a digitized workforce make global hiring more than just a pricey C-suite search.\n\nGlobal payment processing platform Payoneer has its hands in the borderless hiring world from an internal perspective (with about 2,200 employees in 50 countries and more than 25 offices globally), but it also benefits from and drives the borderless trend with its clients.\n\n\"The rhetoric about the globalized opportunity is powerful, but it doesn't make any difference to the business you're doing unless you actually have the utilities and tools to do it,\" said Payoneer CEO John Caplan.\n\nPockets of talent worldwide\n\nAdam Jackson, CEO of decentralized tech talent platform Braintrust, does borderless differently. \"We don't have a physical office,\" he said. \"Everyone works remotely. Every engineer but one who works on Braintrust is outside of the U.S.\" Braintrust's clients, from NASA to Nestl\u00e9, are building borderless teams, too, Jackson says.\n\n\"It was the case maybe 20 years ago when I moved to San Francisco that the best tech, best developers, best product managers and designers all lived here in Silicon Valley,\" Jackson added. \"That's just not true anymore. There are still many here, but there are pockets all over the world.\"\n\nSome leaders, like Johnson, believe time zone coordination is still important to provide certain employees with the opportunity to work synchronously. Jackson, however, has the viewpoint that global innovation with an asynchronous workforce is a chance to create a company \"where the sun never sets.\"\n\nWhile there are questions about work-life balance, Jackson says that doesn't exist in startup culture anyway, but that asynchronous work can increase clarity in documentation and minimize the endless treadmill of meetings, leaving more time for creative thinking and deep work.\n\nJohnson says local labor laws, compliance and payroll are all factors at play in global operations, which is why many organizations have opened centers in specific countries. But even these obstacles aren't insurmountable.\n\nAI and future of work geographies\n\nOne thing these experts agree on is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to borderless hiring. \"Every company has to find their own bespoke solution,\" Caplan said. \"You have to design your office footprint, your future-of-work philosophy to the business you're building.\"\n\nThinking about artificial intelligence innovation and, on the flip side of the same coin, AI regulation, Johnson says the European Union's standard-setting regulatory framework will make it tough for tech operations to thrive. As more regulatory and case law settles around the globe surrounding AI and data, cross-border employment trends will shift like puzzle pieces.\n\n\"I think Europe is going to have a really tough time over the next few years,\" he said. \"They're pushing a lot of data innovation out of the continent, and I think that's an opportunity for Africa and Latin America and other parts of the world.\"\n\nRegardless of where organizations hire, Jackson emphasizes the importance of managing risk and hiring good people. \"Quality still matters,\" he said. \"The old adage is when you're building software, do you want to be fast, good quality, or cheap? Pick two. Now, I reject that. You can have all three, but quality still matters, no matter where you are.\"\n\nCaplan relishes in the more altruistic potential of borderless employment, namely its ability to \"lift up communities around the globe.\" This may be true, but at the very least, its benefits for expanded talent reach and cost effectiveness are enough for leaders in all kinds of industries to take it on. With applications for standard work-sponsored visas in the U.S. up 263% in 2023 compared to the year prior, according to Deel's latest Tech Migration Report, and U.S. cities accounting for the top five average monthly apartment rent costs, borderless hiring could ease the burden for employment seekers and employment providers in one\n\n\"If you could make your single biggest expense, which is talent, 10% more efficient, you have a dramatic advantage,\" Johnson said. Borderless hiring, it seems, will continue to infiltrate the growth playbook at all levels.",

        "body": "A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.\n\nDividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.\n\nInvestors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.\n\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nThe first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.\n\nDarden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.\n\nSaleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.\n\n\"We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,\" said Saleh.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)\n\nInternational Seaways\n\nNext up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.\n\nFollowing meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.\n\nAccordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.\n\nNolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). \"We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,\" said the analyst.\n\nNolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nCitigroup\n\nFinally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThe bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.\n\nFollowing the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.\n\nRamsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.\n\n\"The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,\" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.\n\nRamsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%. (See Citigroup Technical Analysis on TipRanks)",

The major contributor to the upside was a blowout fiscal 2025 first quarter accompanied by strong current quarter guidance. During the post-earnings call in May, the risk of a so-called air pocket in sales momentum as the company transitions to its new Blackwell chip architecture was taken off the table . Management said demand for the yet-to-be-released platform already outstrips supply. Last week, if only briefly, Nvidia became the most valuable U.S. company. After record high after record high, the stock pulled back recently. On Wednesday, at Nvidia's annual shareholders meeting, founder and CEO Jensen Huang took questions and laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its lead position in enabling AI. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD The second big winner was Apple , which rose 22.82% in Q2. The stock didn't do much in the first month of the second quarter. However, all that changed in early May when the company reported solid earnings . Services revenue was better than expected and China was nowhere near as bad as feared. That got the stock going. But the real break out to all-time highs followed the company's AI announcements at this month's Worldwide Developers Conference. Shares took that other leg up, in our view, because Apple Intelligence will only be available on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models or better. That means the vast majority of iPhone users, who we know to be extremely loyal to the brand, have a better reason than ever before to upgrade their devices. We expect many to do so. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD Broadcom came in third and saw its stock advance 21.13% in April through June. After consolidating for much of the quarter, the stock started jumping earlier this month on strong quarterly results and management raising their outlook for AI-related revenue generation. Investors also came away with increased confidence that the legacy aspects of the business were bottoming and set to rebound into the back half of the year. That confidence also makes sense when considering that Broadcom is a key Apple supplier. So any outsized AI-upgrade cycle that Apple sees is going to translate into a strong cycle for suppliers like Broadcom as well. Worst Performers EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD Estee Lauder was the worst name of the second quarter for the Club portfolio, losing 30.98%. The stock was largely rangebound in April, however, the negative momentum took hold once again when shares got punished for its light guidance. Management's disappointing outlook sparked fresh concerns over the pace of the recovery in Asia Travel Retail. While the report was largely positive and we did see signs of an inflection playing out, these concerns on the pace and magnitude of the recovery continue to weigh on shares. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD The second worst performer was Disney , which dropped 18.85% in April through June. Disney started to drift back down after management won its proxy fight to keep activist investor Nelson Peltz off the company board. Peltz, who had a big stake in Disney, exited the position. The stock then took another hit on lackluster earnings , in which the company missed expectations on the top line. While noting that Disney's combined direct-to-consumer (DTC) business is still on the path to profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024 in September, the current quarter would see pressure resulting seasonal weakness attributable to its streaming offering in India, known as Disney+ Hotstar. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD The third worst performer of the quarter was Stanley Black & Decker , with an 18.42% decline. While shares recovered post-earnings losses quickly, they subsequently reversed back down and now sit below where the level reached in the selloff after the quarterly numbers were release in early May. At least some of that pressure was likely caused by a rebound in longer-term bond yields, which kept borrowing costs high. We view Stanley Black & Decker as our play on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which when they happen, should lower mortgages and boost the housing market. Stanley Black & Decker was one of nine stocks featured in our Fed rate cut stocks commentary. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. \"Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.\n\n\"I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,\" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.\n\nThroughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.\n\nThe messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.\n\nMuch of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.\n\n\"As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,\" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. \"I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.\n\nBiden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: \"Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.\"\n\nBut debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.\n\nThis year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.\n\nIn the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.\n\nThe Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.",

        "body": "At 32, after 12 years of living rent-free with my parents in the San Francisco Bay area, I was ready to move into my own place. I had saved $400,000 and had the flexibility to make the leap, but whether it was uncertain streams of income, wanderlust and mostly, the financial benefits of staying put, something had been holding me back. Until November 2023, when I visited a friend at their Fremont, California, apartment complex. When I walked in, it felt like home. As fate would have it, as I was leaving, I met my friend's neighbors, a couple breaking their lease. My gut told me that this was the right moment. After a few hours and some paperwork, I secured a four-month sublease agreement from them for $2,000 a month. It was the perfect transitional space. Once my sublease was up, in April, I moved into a 556-square-foot studio in the same complex for $2,146 a month. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online The building is 10 minutes away from the studio I built off of my parent's place where I teach my music students, and less than a 10 minute drive from two beloved local Costco stores. That might seem like an odd amenity to look for in real estate, but to me, it was a huge asset. Altogether, I have spent over $5,000 to outfit my place almost entirely with Costco products.\n\nTaking a break in my living room. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nWhy Costco means so much to me\n\nCostco was a shopping staple for my family when I was growing up. And back in 2013, I started going all the time after work, to browse the aisles and try out samples while waiting out the rush hour traffic. Over time, Costco has become more than just a store to me \u2014 it's a place for me to belong and feel like myself. My love for it inspired me to create my Instagram account, Costco Claudia. Since launching in winter of 2022, Costco Claudia has become a creative outlet and an income stream. On the account, I primarily post videos of myself modeling women's clothing in the store, and I currently have 191,000 followers and counting. While I have never worked directly with or for Costco, I have had partnerships with brands that are sold by the company.\n\nMe in front of one of my favorite local Costco's. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI currently make about $7,000 a month as an influencer and $5,000 a month from my job as a piano teacher. One of the most surprising and gratifying parts of this experience has been the incredible positivity I've received from my Costco Claudia community. They offered so much comfort and solidarity when I felt most alone, particularly as I learned about my PMDD and navigated living on my own. Their support has helped me through some of my toughest times.\n\nTake a look inside my cozy California studio\n\nFor utilities, I spend about $102 a month: $27 for water and trash collection, $30 for internet, and $45 for electricity. Take a look inside: My kitchen is a space to fuel up and get ready for the day Over the years, I've collected a bunch of discounted stuff from Costco sales: glasses, plates, bowls, my NutriBullet, a Brita filter, and loads of snacks.\n\nOne of my favorite items in my kitchen is my coffee machine. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nWhat I really rely on in my kitchen are my coffee machine and the garage \"work table\" \u2014 both found at Costco \u2014 which doubles as my kitchen table. It's sturdy and looks great with the faux fur sheepskins I use to cover my chairs.\n\nThis work table is one of my favorite finds. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI surround myself with greenery and music in my living room After a long day of teaching, I enjoy winding down in my cozy living room. My forest of growing monsteras and succulents adds a touch of greenery and calmness to the space.\n\nMusic brings me so much joy, and this piano gets a lot of use at my place. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI like to lie on my couch and lose myself in classical music on my piano. Surrounded by blankets, sheepskin rugs, pillows, and stylish tray, it's the perfect way to recharge after a busy day. My bathroom is both luxurious and pragmatic\n\nMy bathroom is pretty spacious for a small space, and I found most of my essentials at Costco. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nIn my bathroom, the essentials that I can't do without: my gold hoop earrings, my two pairs of glasses and my contacts that I wear every single day. When I first moved out, I found all the bathroom basics I needed at Costco: towels, hand towels, a shower curtain, soap dispenser, and mats. When allergy season strikes, the tissue paper is a lifesaver, since they sell it in bulk. The real steal in my bathroom is the perfume that usually goes for $200 at other stores but is $69.99 at Costco. I've got two of them, and they've become my go-to scents. My bedroom is a haven My $250 bed frame paired with my $500 mattress are so comfortable. I have two sets of Kirkland Signature 680 Thread Count Sheet Set that I snagged when they went on sale. I love my down blanket and I have another favorite I got for $12.\n\nMe in my cozy bedroom. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nIn woven side baskets, I stash my Costco pajamas, keeping everything neat and organized. I also love my Shark Roomba, which cleans my apartment when I'm not here. An outdoor space with possibility The outdoor space isn't fully furnished yet. So far, my Costco paddle board is the centerpiece.\n\nI'm very excited to use my outdoor space and my paddle board this summer. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It\n\nI moved during the winter, but now that summer is upon us, I hope to add more to the space soon. I've got my eye on some discounted outdoor patio sets.\n\nThe sweatshirt says it all. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It",

        "title": "How to avoid scams while job-hunting online, according to career experts",
        "body": "Landing a job has become more difficult, even while the labor market may look robust \u2014 and it's a situation that scammers are eager to exploit. It's a big enough issue that federal agencies like the FBI and Federal Trade Commission have issued warnings about job scams. One common scheme: Swindlers who pose as recruiters and contact you unprompted \u2014 including on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn or even through WhatsApp messages \u2014 to entice you with a job opportunity you didn't apply for. Then, they may ask you to send them money or personal information, according to Amanda Augustine, a career expert at TopResume. Or they might claim that you first need to complete their training course or coaching services to be eligible for their job opening in a predatory attempt to sell you their products, she says. While real recruiters do often reach out cold to potential hires, there's a key difference between them and the grifters: \"They're straightforward with you,\" says career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin. Here are ways to spot and protect yourself from a con while job-hunting.\n\nBe skeptical if the job looks too perfect\n\nIf a job posting \"seems too good to be true,\" it probably is, Augustine says. That includes openings promising to make you a lot of money fast. In those \"get-rich-quick\" instances, \"run for the hills,\" Augustine cautions. Be wary if a company is quick to offer you a position without going through the standard vetting procedure. A legitimate process should require at least one interview, even if it's only over the phone, she says. Still, an interview doesn't guarantee the role is above board. Scammers sometimes hold phony interviews using text chat and video messaging to obtain your personal information without blowing their cover, according to ZipRecruiter. Some duped job hunters have taken to social media to share their experiences with fake interviews. LinkedIn blocked more than 63 million fake accounts during the second half of 2023, according to its most recent community report. The platform also removed more than 108 million pieces of spam and scam content over the same period, per the report. The job site is \"committed to ensuring the platform remains authentic, secure, and easy to use for members,\" said Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn's vice president of trust product management, in a statement. Ultimately, if a recruiter reaches out to you for an unusually attractive job you haven't applied for, \"you need to be especially suspicious,\" Augustine says.\n\nQuestion vague or nonexistent job descriptions\n\nSometimes a disguised fraudster will insist they can't provide any details because a job posting is confidential. But generally, if a company can't produce a copy of the job description, that's a big red flag, Augustine says. Some companies make executive-level job openings confidential to high-profile applicants at first, but they will begin disclosing more details about the role as the interview process gets underway. \"If you are not at a director level or above and someone is approaching you for a confidential listing, it's probably a scam, because there isn't really much reason for a company to be cagey about hiring an individual contributor or a manager-level position,\" Gavin says. \"It's those senior-level positions that can have some PR consequences if it is known that they're doing a search.\" For job openings that have no reason being kept so tightly under wraps, a formal job description should be handed over upon request, Augustine explains. You should also watch out for job descriptions that are \"really vague\" and fail to offer enough information about the job title, location, key responsibilities and qualifications. A job description riddled with typos and errors can also indicate a scam. Because of new tools powered by artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that can fix grammatical issues in text, however, Augustine says this clue is becoming less prominent.\n\nCheck the company's online footprint\n\nYou should be able to locate a company's digital presence, Augustine says. That could be a LinkedIn profile, website or social media page. \"Even your mom-and-pop ice cream shop has a Facebook page these days,\" she says. \"If there's absolutely no digital trail about this company, or it's really, really sparse when you're running some Google searches, I would be concerned.\" Ask a prospective employer to direct you to their website \u2014 where you can also see if the job listing is posted \u2014 and double-check any links you receive to make sure they don't route to a phishing website, Gavin suggests. Exercise caution if a recruiter is not using a corporate email address, Augustine says. You may find third-party recruiters who use a Gmail account, but internal recruiters typically have a company email address, she notes. Also, watch out for communications from email addresses with misspellings or \"spoofed\" company names that are similar but slightly different from the actual business name, according to Indeed's guidelines for a safe job search.

        "body": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\n\nFor 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.\n\nMost recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver \"The Blind,\" \"The Chosen,\" \"Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist\" and \"Waitress: the Musical\" to audiences. Still to come is \"Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.\"\n\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.\n\nFathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach \u2014 as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains \u2014 has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.\n\n\"Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.\"\n\nIn post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.\n\nSeason 4 of \"The Chosen,\" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.\n\n\"'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,\" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. \"It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.\"\n\nFathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.\n\n\"We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,\" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. \"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.\"\n\nThis year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" as well as the 35th anniversary of \"Steel Magnolias.\" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of \"Blazing Saddles,\" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" the 40th anniversary of \"Neverending Story\" and the 20th anniversary of \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIt also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" the 35th anniversary of \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and the 30th anniversary of \"Pom Poko.\"\n\nAnd these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.\n\nFathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,\" Bagby said. \"We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.\"\n\n4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.\n\nAudiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Coraline,\" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.\n\nFathom re-released \"Coraline\" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\nThat $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for \"Coraline\" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.\n\nWhat's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.\n\n\"New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.\n\nFathom reports presales for this year's screenings of \"Coraline\" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.\n\nBecause Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.\n\n\"[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,\" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. \"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.\"",

        "body": "Vandalized posters with images of local candidates for the European Parliament election mixed with those from the first round of the 2024 French legislative elections, seen on June 24 2024, in Val d Arry, Calvados. France will hold an early legislative election in two rounds on June 30 and July 7 2024, following President Emmanuel Macrons decision which was triggered by his party's heavy defeat to the far-right National Rally in the 2024 European Parliament election. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nFrench voters are heading to the polls on Sunday for the first round of voting in a snap parliamentary election that could see the far-right National Rally group become the biggest party in France's National Assembly, polls suggest. France's President Emmanuel Macron shocked the electorate and political pundits in early June when he called the ballot after his Renaissance party suffered a drubbing in European Parliament elections at the hands of National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella and veteran right-wing politician Marine Le Pen.\n\nFrench far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party President and lead MEP Jordan Bardella (R) gives his electoral card to vote at a polling station in the first round of parliamentary elections in Garches, suburb of Paris, on June 30, 2024. Julien De Rosa | Afp | Getty Images\n\nCalling the snap election, which involves two rounds of polling on Sunday and on July 7, Macron said the vote would provide \"clarification\" and that \"France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony.\" Analysts said Macron's shock move was likely based on the gamble that, even if National Rally performs well, a potentially chaotic and disordered period in power will reduce the likelihood that his rival Le Pen will assume French leadership in 2027. Close watchers of French politics also note that Macron is ultimately betting on French citizens fearing a far-right government and voting against the nationalist and anti-immigration party. But voter polls in June have consistently put National Rally ahead in the race, predicting the party will take around 35% of the vote, ahead of the leftist New Popular Front bloc with around 25-26% of the ballot and Macron's centrist Together alliance, in third place with around 19% of the vote.\n\nEven if a hung parliament is the most likely outcome of the vote \u2014 with no single party looking as if it can achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly \u2014 a strong showing for National Rally will put pressure on Macron to appoint a prime minister from the party. That new PM \u2014 who in this scenario would likely be the 28-year-old National Rally President Jordan Bardella \u2014 would then have a significant say over France's domestic and economic policy, while President Macron would remain in charge of foreign policy and defense.\n\nMarine Le Pen, President of the National Rally group in the National Assembly, joins Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), at the final rally before the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, held at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIn any case, such an outcome would force ideologically different (and often opposed) politicians into an uneasy and awkward \"cohabitation\" where government is likely fractious and unstable, prompting some concern among economists as to how the vote could affect the euro zone's second-largest economy. \"The market has reacted negatively to the election uncertainty, with French equities underperforming and the France-Germany 10-year yield spread widening,\" Peter Garnry, head of Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note Monday. \"Despite this, some views suggest the market may be overreacting, drawing parallels to Italy's experience under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose initially feared policies were more pragmatic than expected,\" he noted.\n\nPolitical analysts point out that a period of hard bargaining is likely to follow the election, as parties look to forge alliances that would enable them to achieve parliamentary majority and govern as fractiously as possible. It could be a torturous process, analysts warn. \"As with the 2022 elections, no party or bloc is likely to secure enough seats to form a majority government, although some polls give the RN an outside chance of doing so. The next government is highly likely to require some form of negotiation between different parties,\" George Dyson, senior analyst at Control Risks said in analysis Monday. \"In the event that the RN secures enough votes to come close to forming a government, it will potentially be able to secure support from dissident members of the [center-right] Republicans to secure a majority or argue that no other government is feasible.\" Dyson noted that, as current polling suggests that the united left bloc will be the second largest in parliament after the RN, the next administration may also conceivably be a left-wing government that can cobble together support from the Republicans and Macron's centrist Renaissance party. \"Macron will likely push for support from centrist parties to put forwards a candidate of his choosing for prime minister, but the parties would be unlikely to provide their support as his party is projected to perform very poorly,\" Dyson said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron looks on after delivering a speech to the Nexus Institute in the Amare theatre in The Hague on April 11, 2023 as part of a state visit to the Netherlands.

        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

        "body": "Peopleimages | Istock | Getty Images\n\nTo effectively plan for your retirement, experts say, you need to watch your savings rate and total nest egg. But how much you really need to have set aside depends on another number \u2014 your life expectancy. Yet that figure is also the most elusive \u2014 no one knows how long they will live. \"Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,\" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries. The financial industry typically uses age 95 as a default assumption, according to research from HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software. More from Personal Finance:\n\nWhy inflation is still upending retirement plans\n\nOlder voters want candidates who will protect Social Security\n\nWorkers in certain industries tend to have higher 401(k) balances Instead of planning for one life expectancy number, the Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries emphasize longevity. Longevity risk measures the likelihood someone may live longer than expected and outlive their savings. \"If you read that life expectancy is 84 and you are planning on your money lasting until 84, there's a big surprise behind the curtain that you haven't opened,\" Schilling said. \"There's a really good chance for a lot of reasons that you might need your money to last longer than that.\"\n\nLongevity estimates may bring surprises\n\nThe Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries recently relaunched a free online longevity illustrator. The tool asks for basic information on either an individual or a couple: age, sex, retirement age, smoking status and a description of their general health \u2014 poor, average or excellent. The results aim to provide a \"reasonable\" estimate of how long you might live, according to the organizations. The illustrations show the probability of living to certain ages, as well as the number of years of life one might live in retirement. Generally, the higher your current age, the greater the possibility you may live longer. While life expectancy at birth may be 84, it will be even longer if you've already made it to age 65, Schilling said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe results may help individuals fully understand the range of possibilities when planning for how long their money may need to last, she said. For couples, there is also another revelation that often comes as a surprise. \"The chance that at least one of you lives to 90 is even bigger,\" Schilling said. Yet the financial industry's assumption of living to age 95 may be too generous, according to recent research from HealthView Services. The projected life expectancy for someone who is 65 years old today with no chronic conditions is age 90 for women and age 88 for men. Yet only around 5% of people over 60 have no chronic conditions, according to the research.\n\nHealth status affects life expectancy projections\n\nChronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity or Parkinson's disease reduce an individual's projected life expectancy. For example, while a healthy 65-year-old man with no chronic conditions has a 19.3% probability of living to age 95 or longer, that gets reduced to a 17.5% chance if he has high blood pressure, 15.8% if he has cardiovascular disease, 12.5% for high cholesterol, 8.8% for obesity with a body mass index of 35 to 39, 7.4% for tobacco use, 2% for obesity with body mass index of 40 to 44 and to just 0.4% for diabetes, according to the research. Those probabilities could mean a huge difference to his retirement funding needs. A healthy 65-year-old man may need around $1.1 million to maintain the 80% income replacement rate he needs if he was earning $100,000 in 2023, according to HealthView Services. This assumes he lives to age 95, has a 6% annual portfolio return, receives Social Security benefits, and inflation is 3%.\n\nHowever, if that 65-year-old man has a chronic condition, his life expectancy will be lower. And that could free up more of that retirement nest egg to be spent in other ways, according to HealthView Services. High blood pressure could reduce his life expectancy by nine years to age 86, and therefore allow for $447,469 to be used for long-term care planning, emergency savings, money for heirs or other uses, the research found. Tobacco use could reduce his life expectancy by 13 years to 82, freeing up $616,245, the research estimates, while diabetes may reduce his lifespan by 16 years, enabling him to spend $727,947. Most experts advise individuals to plan for outliving their assets by delaying Social Security retirement benefits or considering an annuity to amplify monthly income.\n\nHow personalized numbers can help",

        "body": "Users of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox have been trying to get their money back for a decade. From the beginning of July, the company will begin paying users back their funds. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMt. Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago after a major hack, is finally set to repay creditors, who are being rewarded handsomely for their patience. Up to 950,000 bitcoin were lost in the 2011 hack, at a time when the cryptocurrency was trading for a tiny fraction of its current value. Some 140,000 of those coins were recovered, a haul that, at today's prices, means that roughly $9 billion worth of bitcoin will be returned to its owners. Among the claimants is Illinois native Gregory Greene. Soon after the exchange declared bankruptcy in February 2014, Greene filed a class action lawsuit against Mt. Gox and its former CEO. Greene said at the time that his frozen account contained $25,000 in bitcoin, though he didn't disclose the exact number of coins in his wallet. Bitcoin was then trading at roughly $600. Today it's worth over $60,000. That suggests Greene's lost stash, at current prices, would be worth about $2.5 million, a 10,000% gain. However, it's unclear how much he'll receive in the payouts, which are expected to start rolling out in July. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, said creditors are about to get a historic windfall. \"Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,\" Glover told CNBC.\n\nWhat was Mt. Gox?\n\nMt. Gox was an online marketplace where people could buy or sell bitcoin using different currencies. At the height of its success, the platform was the largest spot bitcoin exchange in the world, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin.\n\nThe company, whose acronym was created from the name \"Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange,\" shuttered in February 2014 after a series of heists. Mt. Gox blamed the bitcoin disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency's framework. While users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when accessing the exchange, in reality coins may have been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts, Mt. Gox said. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin next month. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto asset management firm Galaxy Digital, said in a note last month that the vast majority of creditors he's spoken with have said they will take a payout in-kind, meaning in cryptocurrency rather than fiat. They'll also be largely holding on to the assets. Many of the top holders with claims to Mt. Gox assets, he said, are well known in the bitcoin world. They include early bitcoin investor Roger Ver, Blockstream co-founders Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, and Bruce Fenton, former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nSome will 'take the money and run'\n\nBased on conversations with institutional investors due for payouts, \"we do not believe there will be significant selling from this cohort,\" Thorn wrote. However, Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays, said there's still likely to be significant selling among creditors who, after years of waiting, have the opportunity to lock in massive gains. \"Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,\" said Glover. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said the potential for heavy selling from Mt. Gox creditors creates \"downside risk\" next month, though it would be short-lived.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,\" the analysts wrote. There's also the likelihood that a number of bitcoin investors in Mt. Gox have already cashed out. In the 10 years since the exchange filed for bankruptcy, a secondary market sprung up for those who wanted to liquidate their bankruptcy claim. Those who have held out are the true believers, Thorn said. \"Thousands of these creditors have waited 10 years for payouts and resisted compelling and aggressive claims' offers during that time, suggesting they want their coins back,\" said Thorn. He said he expects limited selling pressure but acknowledged that if even 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold \"it will have a market impact.\" Certain tax consequences may deter sales. Luke Nolan, ethereum research associate at digital asset management firm CoinShares, said a big reason Mt. Gox creditors opted for in-kind reimbursement has to do with the tax implications. And JPMorgan said in a note on Monday that people are leaning toward accepting their disbursement in crypto, \"either for tax reasons or because they think that liquidating now would void potential further price gains in future.\" Glover said there are ways to sidestep a big capital gains tax while still taking advantage of bitcoin's huge run-up in value. \"Those in jurisdictions with capital gains tax may elect to hold their positions to avoid this huge tax bill,\" Glover said, \"and instead use their bitcoin as collateral to borrow dollars, thus monetizing the bitcoin without having to sell it.\"",

I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,\" he said.\n\nAfter North Carolina, the president flew to New York to deliver remarks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center to mark Pride Month.

        "body": "Here are a few of the practices that contribute to the longevity and happiness of some of Japan's longest-living people.\n\nThe island's age-defying residents caught the attention of authors H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda and Francesc Miralles. The pair interviewed over 100 of the oldest people in Okinawa and wrote about the principles and techniques that Japanese centenarians adhere to daily in their book titled Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life .\n\nOn average, Okinawan women live longer lives than women from all other areas worldwide, according to longevity expert Dan Buettner . Additionally, \"Okinawans have less cancer, heart disease and dementia than Americans,\" Buettner wrote on his site .\n\nBlue Zones are areas in the world with the most people living the longest lives.\n\nIf you, like many others, have ever fallen down a rabbit hole trying to learn more about what causes some people to live longer and feel more happiness, then you've probably already heard of Blue Zones like Okinawa, Japan.\n\n1. Engage in low-intensity movement for at least 5 minutes a day\n\nJust about every super-ager that Garc\u00eda and Miralles spoke to shared that they regularly practice radio taiso which is a well-known, decades-old Japanese exercise.\n\n\"Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs,\" the authors wrote in their book.\n\nIt helps that the exercise calls for low-intensity movements and can be completed in five minutes or less. And what makes the practice really stand out is that it's typically done among groups of people.\n\nOne of the main goals of radio taiso is to \"promote a spirit of unity among participants,\" according to Garc\u00eda and Miralles.\n\n2. Find a purpose and stay busy\n\nThere's a Japanese proverb that states: \"Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.\" Okinawans achieve this by finding their ikigai, or purpose, that encourages them to focus on their deeper meaning in life.\n\nIkigai can be loosely translated to \"the happiness of always being busy.\" Often, people who live the longest don't retire.\n\nFor example, Hayao Miyazaki, 83, is the director of animated films at Studio Ghibli in Japan. A day after retiring in the 90s, Miyazaki came to work to sketch new animations; he just released a movie in 2023.\n\n3. Achieving a state of flow\n\n\"There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai,\" Garc\u00eda and Miralles wrote in their book. \"But one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an 'optimal experience.'\"\n\nFlow is a concept used to describe being fully engaged in an action, and it was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.\n\nBeing engulfed in a state of flow allows you to be more present, improve your focus and temporarily forget about your worries, according to Garc\u00eda and Miralles.\n\n\"The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most,\" they wrote. \"They are the one who spend more time than others in a state of flow.\"\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\" \"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \"disastrous\" prospect.\" \"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\" said Bose. \"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\" she added.\n\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\" Bose said. \"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \"event of death, resignation or disability\" that leaves the role vacant.\n\nwatch now",

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nA curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.\n\nSo, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.\n\nAnd it has been for the past year.\n\nThe price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.\n\nPoor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.\n\nTemperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.\n\nFood prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.\n\n\"The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,\" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. \"Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,\" he added.\n\nKeeping rates elevated, though, appears to be \"an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,\" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.\n\nThe anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.\n\n\"Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,\" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.\n\nThe government also has the option to remove import taxes \u2014 currently set at 40% on wheat \u2014 to hold prices down.\n\nYet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.\n\nLowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.\n\nFor now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.\n\nThere are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.\n\nBut, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.\n\n\"You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,\" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. \"[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.\"\n\n\"That's just the norm,\" he added.",

        "title": "France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means",
        "body": "Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from \"political paralysis\" to \"immediate financial crisis.\" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.\n\nA complex system\n\nUnder France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff \u2014 a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using \"le vote utile\" \u2014 or tactical voting \u2014 to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be \"civil war\" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger \u2014 and therefore more representative \u2014 than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.\n\nMarket turmoil\n\nSuch a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a \"worse reputation globally,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs \u2014 a key indicator of French political risk \u2014 has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Spendthrift agendas\" from either party \u2014 whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax \u2014 could result in an \"immediate financial crisis,\" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently \"too optimistic\" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. \"Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,\" the analysts noted.\n\nPolitical paralysis\n\nThe CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella \u2014 Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally \u2014 was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement \"reasonable\" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would \"need an absolute majority to govern,\" in a bid to boost his backing. \"You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,\" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.",

        "body": "In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

        "body": "Iranian women cast their ballots at a polling station during elections to select members of parliament and a key clerical body, in Tehran on March 1, 2024. ATTA KENARE | AFP\n\nIran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash \u2014 and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners \u2014 and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years \u2014 and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.\n\nwatch now\n\nMost of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. \"In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,\" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. \"Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,\" they wrote. \"A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.\"\n\nWho is running?\n\nTwo candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.\n\nWhere the real power lies\n\nIran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks with media after casting his ballot during the Iranian Parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections at the Leadership office in Tehran, Iran, on March 1, 2024.

        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nChina: 'Starkly different visions' of America\n\nChina's CGTN, the English-language service of state-run China Global Television Network, said: \"Biden started hesitantly and Trump answered steadily in a halting clash.\" Accusations of lies and that each of them was the worst-ever U.S. president, were rife, the outlet said. Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post said that the two \"presented starkly different visions for America's place in the world,\" and that it was a \"high-stakes debate.\" Before it kicked off, China's state-backed tabloid Global Times said it was expected to be \"like a reality show.\"\n\nIndia: 'Democrats in full-blown panic'\n\nThe Times of India led its story with concerns from Democrats about Biden's performance, with the headline reading: \"'We are f***ed': Democrats in full-blown panic over Joe Biden's debate performance.\" Biden \"delivered a shaky, halting performance,\" it said, while \"Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks.\" Elsewhere, India Today said Biden \"stammered and fumbled\" multiple times, while describing Trump's performance as \"forceful and aggressive.\"\n\nUK: 'Biden struggles ... Trump lies'\n\nIn the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: \"Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate.\" Many of Trump's replies to straightforward questions had little to do with the topic at hand, the paper said, and he made frequent false claims which were not fact-checked by the moderators. Biden, meanwhile, \"frequently struggled to complete his thoughts.\" The Times of London said that Biden's reelection campaign was \"plunged into crisis\" following the debate and that the current president's responses to questions were \"meandering and muddled,\" while Trump's were \"more assured and disciplined.\" Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump's attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: \"Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions.\" Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was \"marked by personal attacks.\"\n\nGermany: 'True losers ... are the Americans'\n\nGermany's broadcaster ZDF described the debate as \"more civilized\" but \"more charged\" than in 2020, adding that Trump had a better start, but Biden caught up later on, according to a CNBC translation. At first, Biden did not appear very agile and hesitated, it said, but added that his tone was \"somewhat surprisingly\" as aggressive and sharp as Trump's. On individual topics, Biden had \"clear words\" for Trump when it came to abortion, but things got \"uncomfortable\" for him on immigration \u2014 while Trump tried to dodge questions about the January 2021 Capitol Hill riot.\n\nSueddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, titled one of its stories: \"Joe Biden's bad evening,\" saying that even though his answers had more substance than Trump's, Biden's verbal stumbling raised concerns. In another story, the newspaper summarized the debate: \"Biden disgraces himself, Trump wastes his chance, but the true losers of the first TV debate in the U.S. election campaigns are the Americans.\"\n\nFrance: 'Uneven' performance",

They don't want to sound overly complacent about the risks of inflation,\" Sheets said.\n\n\"But we think the data that the ECB will see by September is inflation [is] continuing to moderate. And I think, for the Fed, inflation is continuing to fall,\" he added.\n\nEuro zone inflation surprised to the upside in May, rising by 0.2 percentage point on a month-on-month basis to hit 2.6%. Fluctuations had been expected, due to base effects from the energy market and the unwinding of government support across the bloc.\n\nU.S. inflation, meanwhile, held steady in May but was up 3.3% from a year ago, the latest CPI data showed earlier this month. That was an improvement on the 0.1% monthly gain economists had expected.\n\nMarkets are now watching out for May's core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, due Friday morning.\n\nAnalysts expect the headline PCE to be flat from April and 2.6% higher on the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE is forecast to come in 0.1% higher month on month, which Sheets said was also in line with his expectations.\n\nA majority of economists polled by Reuters now anticipate the Fed will cut interest rates from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50% this September, with a further trim projected later in the year. The ECB is also expected to cut rates in September and December.",

He's got to get out now and if he doesn't get out we're going to get f------ crushed,\" said the advisor. They told CNBC they planned to approach Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday to discuss what happened at the debate.\n\n\"Game over,\" said a longtime Democratic campaign advisor, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden's 2020 White House bid.\n\nCNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.\n\n\"This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I'm speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,\" said the person, who was granted anonymity in order to recount private conversations.\n\n\"Disaster,\" said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with the president on Saturday in the Hamptons .\n\nMany of the Democratic Party's top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after President Joe Biden 's disappointing debate performance Thursday against Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nAn advisor of one of the Democratic Party's top megadonors called the debate an \"absolute train wreck\" for Biden. \"Worse than [Ronald] Reagan in '84 or [George W.] Bush in '04 or [Barack] Obama in '12,\" they added.\n\nThe problems for Biden at the debate started early. He stumbled out of the gate, appearing to lose his train of thought at times and pausing for a long moment before CNN moderators cut him off when he was discussing U.S. health care.\n\n\"Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the, with the Covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look ...\" Biden said, trailing off.\n\n\"Look, if, we've finally beat Medicare,\" Biden said, before CNN anchor and moderator Jack Tapper gently moved on. \"Thank you, President Biden,\" said Tapper.\n\nSeveral times later in the debate, the president repeated himself, or left several seconds of silence mid-answer. Throughout the evening, Biden's voice was raspy and quiet.\n\nBiden's campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News this was because the president had a cold. \"I think because of the way people analyze debates, it's going to be at first about the physical performance,\" said Landrieu.\n\nEven Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged that Biden was not in top form. \"Yes, it was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\" she said on CNN late Thursday.\n\nFor example, answering a question about border security \u2014 a top voter issue this election cycle \u2014 Biden's sentence was grammatically difficult to follow.\n\n\"I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump pounced on the stumbles. \"I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either,\" the former president quipped.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReplacing Biden on the ticket now would be extremely difficult, with less than two months until the Democratic National Convention in August. The president would effectively have to drop out of the race, leaving the decision about a nominee up to the delegates at the convention.\n\n\"It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden, I don't think there's any other way to slice it,\" Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director in the Biden administration until 2023, said on CNN.\n\n\"His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina \u2014 and he didn't do that,\" she said.",

Both have navigated the White House relationship with the Kremlin for a mandate each and shared very different views of the Russian leader.\n\nTrump \u2014 who has denied accusations that Moscow interfered in his favor in the 2016 election \u2014 claimed that Putin would be deterred from conflict if he respected the leadership of opposing global superpowers.\n\n\"As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u2014 that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u2014 he would have never invaded Ukraine,\" Trump said, according to a CNN transcript of the debate.\n\nDubbing Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"the greatest salesman ever,\" Trump again criticized the extent of U.S. financial support for Kyiv throughout the conflict. Two months ago, Washington approved a foreign aid bill that earmarked roughly $60 billion for the war-torn country.\n\n\"I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th.

It warned the levels were \"alarmingly high\" in a Thursday statement.\n\nAnything above 900 CFUs/100ml fails the Environment Agency's inland bathing water quality standards and is deemed a threat to public health, the campaign group said.\n\nMore than half (47%) of readings were found to be above the acceptable limit. The highest recorded was 25,000 CFUs/100ml, more than 27 times higher.\n\nRiver Action also found E.coli levels up to 10 times higher in March tests.\n\nJames Wallace, CEO of River Action, accused the government and Thames Water, which manages water supply in the area, of failing to appropriately manage water hygiene levels.\n\n\"This is a health emergency. The new government must get a grip of the water pollution crisis and ensure that water companies, including Thames Water, invest urgently in upgrading wastewater treatment plants and fix their leaky infrastructure before someone becomes seriously ill, or worse,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThames Water did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, though the BBC reported that it had dubbed the findings \"alarmist\" and said it was monitoring bacteria levels. CNBC also contacted the government's environment agency but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nChair of the Henley Royal Regatta committee of management and former Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave, said the findings were a \"stark reminder\" of the impact of sewage pollution.\n\n\"Our waterways are vitally important to our competitors racing, but also to all those athletes training on a daily basis nationwide,\" he said.\n\nRegatta organizers have advised rowers to cover all cuts and blisters and avoid swallowing river water as thousands of spectators descend on Henley on Thames for the event, which runs until Sunday.\n\nIt comes as the U.K. has faced a rise in E.coli cases. Two people with underlying health conditions died following infection with the Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli strain (STEC). One of the deaths is \"likely linked\" to their STEC infection, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\n\nThat particular strain is thought to have been spread via lettuce leaves within pre-packaged sandwiches.\n\nUKHSA said Thursday that 275 cases of the strain have been confirmed as of June 25, and urged people to watch out for symptoms which can include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever.",

The last time the currency was at this level was in December 1986. The currency has struggled and again weakened past the 160 level on Thursday. The yen has been steadily deprecating since the Bank of Japan ended its negative interest rate policy and scrapped its yield curve control policy in March.

Dong Chen, chief Asia strategist and head of Asia research at Swiss private bank Pictet, said that he still expects the yen to stay \"fairly weak\" despite warnings of intervention from Japanese officials. \"To be very honest, actually, I don't think that the Japanese authorities can do a lot about [the] yen, and the market has shown that. Because despite all the verbal interventions, or actual interventions that Japan Ministry of Finance has done over the past, they didn't manage to stop the slide of [the] yen.\" Dong explained that this is because the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan remains very wide, and this will keep the yen weak unless this differential is depressed \"more notably.\" The benchmark U.S. federal funds rate stands at 5.25% to 5.5%, while the Bank of Japan's benchmark interest rate is at 0%-0.1%.\n\nwatch now\n\nCompared to intervention, Dong said rising bond yields in Japan or Federal Reserve rate cuts would be a \"more powerful force\" for reversing the yen's decline.",

        "title": "Younger generations of Asians are spending big on art",
        "body": "Younger, wealthy shoppers in Asia are splashing their cash on art, according to a longtime collector and senior auction house executive. Nicolas Chow, Sotheby's chairman for Asia, said more than 40% of its buyers of contemporary art are millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), while Gen X (1965 to 1980) are also likely to be big spenders, he said. \"The buyers are increasingly younger. What we've seen actually in 2023 \u2026 Gen X is the most important buy-base actually \u2014 over a million dollars, they dominate the market,\" Chow told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\" Gen Z \u2014 the youngest age group for buyers \u2014 is \"coming in quite strongly,\" he said, adding that he recently saw a 20-year-old buyer acquire a piece in Shanghai to celebrate his graduation. Wealthy millennials in Asia spent a median of $59,785 on art and antiques during the first half of 2023, while for Gen Zers the figure was $56,000, according to the Art Basel & UBS Survey of Global Collecting 2023. Buying at auction \u2014 instead of from a dealer, for example \u2014 is popular with millennials and Gen X collectors globally, according to the survey. The trend appears to be playing out in Asia. At Christie's Hong Kong spring season auction, held between May 25 and June 1, around a quarter of buyers were new to the auction house, and 43% of those were millennials, according to an online release.\n\nA visitor takes a selfie with work by Yoshitomo Nara during Sotheby's Hong Kong spring sales on April 2, 2024. Chen Yongnuo | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nAnd, while the size of the global art market fell 4% last year to around $65 billion, according to the Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report 2024, sales in China rose by 9% in 2023, overtaking the U.K. as the world's second-largest art market. \"Activity surged as post-lockdown buyers snapped up backlogged auction inventories and as Hong Kong's major fairs and exhibitions returned to full-scale programming,\" wrote report author and founder of Arts Economics, Clare McAndrew. For Sotheby's, the rise in younger buyers is driven in part by an increase in online activity. \"During the pandemic, we really sort of developed our digital abilities with live streaming ... And this has really brought in art to the greater communities and allowed us to engage with our buyers across the world,\" Chow said. Younger collectors are keen on newer art forms, with Gen Z collectors having the highest average expenditure on digital art globally \u2014 as well as prints \u2014 of any generation, according to the Survey of Global Collecting 2023.\n\nYoung digital artists\n\nFor Angelle Siyang-Le, director of the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong, artists who work in digital media are becoming more prominent. \"The definition of digital art nowadays has been expanded from simply photography to video art to NFTs to AI-generated art,\" she told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\"\n\n\n\nAn NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain. Sales of art-related NFTs were $1.2 billion in 2023, less than half the $2.9 billion peak in 2021 \u2014 though still significantly higher than 2020 sales, which were $20 million, according to the Art Market Report 2024. \"With the younger generations becoming more and more prominent in the market ... digital artists ... will be the group of artists getting more attention,\" Siyang-Le added. Hong Kong-based artist Mak2 uses a variety of mediums in her work, including Instagram videos. Her 2017 work, \"You Better Watch Out,\" an inflatable, transparent \"snow globe,\" featured floating QR codes that the audience could scan. CCTV cameras filmed people scanning the codes, which linked to a web page that showed the audience looking at the artwork. \"So you are watching yourself being watched,\" Mak2 told CNBC's Art of Appreciation. \"You're not just looking at your phone, you're becom[ing] data circulat[ing] inside the app and being recorded and analyzed,\" she added.\n\nPeople view work at Art Basel Hong Kong, held in March 2024.

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "body": "A photo illustration of the Chewy logo is seen on a smartphone and a PC screen.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.\n\nChewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.\n\nThere's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\n\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\n\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the \"gamification\" of retail trading.",

Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.\n\n\"While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,\" Barr said. \"The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.\"\n\nThe Fed also performed what it called an \"exploratory analysis\" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.\n\nIn this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\" McMillan told CNBC. \"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\"\n\nConsent required\n\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\n\n\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \"grand experiment in productivity,\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\" with clients, said McMillan. \"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\"\n\nThe broader vision",

        "title": "Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more",
        "body": "How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.\n\nVanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.\n\nThe good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.\n\nThe bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.\n\nThe takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.\n\nHigher returns, participation rates, savings rates\n\nWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.\n\nFirst, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.\n\nBut to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.\n\nOn those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"\n\nPlan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.\n\nThe result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.\n\nParticipant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.\n\nA few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:\n\nThey prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.\n\nThey don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. \"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.\n\nDespite gains in the market, account balances are still low\n\nIn 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.\n\nWhy such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.\n\nDistribution of account balances\n\nLess than $20,000 40%\n\n$20,000-$99,999 30%\n\n$100,000-$249,900 15%\n\n$250,000 + 15%\n\nSource: Vanguard\n\nMedian balances for those near retirement are still low\n\nA different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.\n\nInvestors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.\n\nA median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.\n\nOf course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.\n\nRegardless, the math does not look great\n\nSo let's do some retirement math.\n\nA typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.\n\nNext, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.\n\nFinally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.\n\nAccording to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).\n\nHere's our yearly retirement budget:\n\nPersonal savings $3,539\n\nPension $9,262\n\nSocial Security $20,264\n\nTotal: $33,065\n\nIt's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.\n\nEven then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.\n\nAnd these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.\n\nAnd that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.\n\nIn 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTo have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.\n\nOne issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.\n\nHowever, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.\n\nRegardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.",

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\n\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"",

Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters\n\nDALIAN, China \u2014 For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more \"applications\" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan \u2014 also known as the \"renminbi\" or \"RMB\" \u2014 in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's \"Summer Davos\" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. \"We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,\" she said. \"You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc.\" \"One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,\" Chan said, \"so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the HKEX announced a \"Dual-Counter\" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, \"we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,\" Hu said. \"Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.\"\n\nA maturing financial market\n\nDeveloping more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term \"patient investing.\" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. \"Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,\" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.\n\nWaiting for more Chinese IPOs",

        "body": "Shapecharge | E+ | Getty Images\n\nWhy life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen\n\nMany Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has \"steadily\" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. \"It's a complex transaction,\" he said.\n\nThere are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, \"I do think there's a need for it,\" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.\n\nWhen to buy life insurance\n\nSupersizer | E+ | Getty Images\n\nConsumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. \"Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?\" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.\n\nWhat type of life insurance to buy\n\nThere are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.\n\nIt's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG\n\nIf a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires \u2014 perhaps at age 65 \u2014 the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.\n\nHow much life insurance to get\n\nLuca Sage | Digitalvision | Getty Images",

A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. \"More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are.\" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with \"electrified\" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. \"I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,\" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. \"The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.\"\n\nEV naming\n\nWhile consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles \"electrified,\" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular \"hybrid,\" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as \"hybrid EVs.\" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. \"Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,\" Waatti said.\n\nGM's 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV (right) next to a gas-powered Chevy Equinox on May 16, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\n\nSome automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the \"Wagoneer\" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer \"S\" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. \"I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,\" he said during a recent interview. \"It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.\"\n\nEducation is key\n\nOne thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. \"We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,\" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. \"We're trying our best to educate them.\"\n\n2024 Jeep Wagoneer S EV Jeep\n\nKia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched \"EV Live\" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as \"GM Energy Live,\" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. \"Each customer, in the end, is very different,\" said J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. \"I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,\" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.\n\nAutomotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and \"propulsion\" options than ever before.

        "body": "The budding trends in food sound like a return to the diet of cavemen: Fish is the hottest protein, honey is the flavor du jour and game meat is an upgrade to charcuterie boards. That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:\n\nHoney \u2014 as a flavor\n\nOwl Creek Organics & Natural Products' lineup of honey spreads at the Summer Fancy Foods Show Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nHumans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.\n\nTinned fish\n\nKrill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nIn years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.\n\nFish to go\n\nAcme Smoked Fish's Lox in a Box kits on display at the company's booth Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nExhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named \"satisfying snacks\" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.\n\nUpgraded charcuterie\n\nFossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nLike tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie \u2014 especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.\n\nPairing snacks\n\nWine Chips' Sel Gris-flavored chips are meant to be paired with sparkling wines Amelia Lucas | CNBC",

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023. Irfan Khan | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nDuring an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,\" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. \"That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. \u2026 The batteries will never be affordable.\"\n\nA Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.\n\nFord earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed \"T3,\" from late 2025 to 2026.\n\nFarley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.\n\nHe also said Americans need to \"get back in love\" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.\n\n\"We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,\" Farley said Friday. \"We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.\"\n\nFord's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.\n\nFarley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.\n\n\"If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,\" he said. \"And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.\"",

The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.\n\nTractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.\n\nTractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.\n\n\"Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,\" Tractor Supply said in the news release. \"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.\"\n\nTractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.\n\nThe retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.\n\nThe changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.\n\nCompanies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.",

        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

        "body": "Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.\n\nThe pool began leaking air after just a few uses.\n\nFor Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool \u2014 and the disappointment that came with it \u2014 helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.\n\nAs Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.\n\nSam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.\n\n\"The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,\" he said in an interview. \"Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.\"\n\nThe success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.\n\nOvertaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"Never say never,\" he said. \"Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.\"\n\nBut he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.\n\nThe popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.",

        "body": "The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .\n\nThough the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Power.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.\n\nPreviously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.\n\nThe study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.\n\nAcross the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.\n\nOverall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.\n\n\"Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.\n\nThe study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.\n\nBEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.\n\nTop concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.\n\n\"It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\" Hanley said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

        "body": "In this article RIVN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\n2025 Rivian R1S Rivian\n\nA Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\n\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \"high teens.\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \"R2\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\n\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\"'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\" but \"that is not the case,\" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \"the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\"\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\" Wentworth said. \"What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.\"\n\nHere's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\n63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nChinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.\n\nAlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. \"China is the industry's new disruptor \u2013 capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,\" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .\n\nModels presenting the Chinese automaker's electric car, the BYD Song MAX, at the 45th Bangkok International Motor Show 2024 in Nonthaburi Province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, on March 30, 2024.

        "body": "A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024. Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters\n\nNASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called \"U.S. Deorbit Vehicle.\" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. \"It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,\" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to \"ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.\"\n\nSpaceX's Dragon crew capsule \"Endeavour\" seen from the International Space Station on May 2, 2024. NASA\n\nNASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. \u2013 along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan \u2013 has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.\n\nAging ISS\n\nBut the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. \"The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,\" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.",

        "title": "Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze",
        "body": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .\n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.\n\nLevi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\n\n16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.\n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.\n\n\"People are generally cautious,\" Singh told CNBC in an interview. \"It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\"\n\nWhile Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.\n\nLevi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.\n\n\"In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\" the company said.\n\nThe change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\"Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \"conservative\" view of the channel's growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.\n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.\n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.\n\nFor a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.\n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \"corrected\" that.\n\nRead the full earnings release here.",

        "title": "YouTube dominates streaming, forcing media companies to decide whether it's friend or foe",
        "body": "In this article GOOGL\n\nNFLX\n\nWBD\n\nDIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May \u2014 the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly \"The Gauge\" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. \"We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,\" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. \"Every [media] executive has to be paying attention.\" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV \u2014 an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others \u2014 even at times the same executives \u2014 view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube \"every day\" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. \"I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,\" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. \"When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,\" she said.\n\nYouTube's growing dominance\n\nGoogle's Tara Walpert Levy, now YouTube's vice president of Americas, speaks during a 2016 Advertising Week New York event, Sept. 28, 2016. John Lamparski | Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company \u2014 more than Disney and Comcast combined. \"YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,\" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.\n\nDisney's YouTube focus\n\nDisney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's \"The Gauge\" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.\n\nYou're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\" Brittany Broski YouTube creator\n\n\"I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,\" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as \"Bluey,\" \"Spidey and his Amazing Friends\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\"\n\nCartoon characters from the children's show \"Bluey\" are displayed during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 4, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\n\"At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,\" said Mayer. \"We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have.\" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series \"Disney Junior's Ariel,\" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of \"Winnie the Pooh\" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on \"Winnie the Pooh\" based on the short-form video data, the person said.\n\nNetflix's muted response\n\nNetflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. \"We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,\" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. \"Cocomelon,\" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. \"Cocomelon\" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and \"many more if you add in all languages,\" Mayer said. At the same time, \"Cocomelon\" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.\n\nPosters showing \"Blippi\" and \"Cocomelon\" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images\n\nThe more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.\n\nOther strategies\n\nComcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, scenes from \"The Office\" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a \"YouTube 1.0 strategy\" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. \"I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,\" said Nathanson. \"The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0.\" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack \u2014 pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, \"Beast Games,\" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a \"fast-paced and high-production format,\" as Amazon has promised.\n\nMrBeast accepts the Favorite Male Creator award onstage during the 2023 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, March 4, 2023. Monica Schipper | Getty Images\n\nMrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.\n\nYouTube's community\n\nThe popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. \"I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,\" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. \"You're betraying your audience,\" said Broski. \"You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\"\n\nBrittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nThe business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. \"Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?\" Broski said. \"You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?\" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. \"In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,\" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. \"With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.\"\n\nMichelle Khare at The 2023 Streamy Awards in Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2023.

        "body": "In this article MANU Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Boeing 767 passenger aircraft of Delta Air Lines arrives from Dublin at JFK International Airport in New York as the Manhattan skyline looms in the background on Feb. 7, 2024. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty Images\n\nDelta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines \u2014 second to Delta in net profit margins \u2014 is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. \"Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,\" Bastian told CNBC.\n\nEd Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2022. Bastian said that he sees 'strong demand' for flights carrying into 2023. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDelta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. \"The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,\" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. \"We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. \"If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for.\" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead \u2014 if not drive \u2014 shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is \"part art\" and \"part science,\" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. \"Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,\" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards FactSet\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. \"They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,\" he said. \"And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nWhen the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. \"It was about building the operation brick by brick,\" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. \"It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand.\" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. \"One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,\" said Anderson. \"If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home.\" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. \"They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,\" he said. \"They have time to serve rather than to apologize.\" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.\n\nTime to remodel\n\nAfter Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. \"You had the liberty to start investing in premium,\" he said. \"You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers.\" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. \"I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,\" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. \"I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things.\" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.\n\nwatch now\n\nDelta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (\"It's proprietary,\" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, \"I must be in some third-world country.\" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a \"juniority benefit.\" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.\n\nLuxury air travel? In the U.S.?\n\nLuxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years \u2014 and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. \"Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,\" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year \u2014 which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate \u2014 after an uproar from customers.\n\n'We're constantly pushing each other\"\n\nBoth Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. \"Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.\n\nwatch now",

We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.\n\nSubramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.\n\nAs part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.\n\nThe newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.\n\nFedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.\n\nInvestor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.\n\nSubramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a \"top priority\" for the company.\n\nWhile the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.\n\nUPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.",

        "body": "In this article LEVI Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Levi's store at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets in Florida. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Levi Strauss, year to date",

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.\n\n\"Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,\" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. \"However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.\"\n\nThose comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.\n\nRecent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only \"modest further progress.\"\n\nBowman noted that there are \"a number of upside risks\" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.\n\n\"I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\" she said. \"Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nWhile that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% \"for some time.\"\n\nMoreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said \"it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.\"\n\nIn other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.\n\n\"With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,\" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nWhile Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.\n\nBoth officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.\n\n\"I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. \"We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.\"\n\nAlso, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees \"more months\" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.\n\nAs governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's\n\n\"dot plot\" grid of rate expectations as well as the Summary of Economic Projections.",

        "title": "Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company",
        "body": "Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.\n\nActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.\n\nRapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.\n\nDespite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space \u2013 it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.\n\nWith a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.\n\nGiven industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",

Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see what God is doing,\u201d Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. \u201cAnd I think we all know this, but \u2026 there\u2019s a revival spreading. There\u2019s joy, there\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\nThe evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d the \u201cmost sung and most translated hymn ever.\u201d Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.\n\n\u201c[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God\u2019s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,\u201d Hall said.\n\nThe faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people\u2019s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see the hunger, and we\u2019re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God\u2019s changed them.\u201d\n\nHall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. \u2026 I\u2019ve got three kids, I\u2019m in a ministry now 20 plus years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I\u2019m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the year, Hall said he hopes \u201cAnthem of Grace\u201d helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.\n\n\u201cIn my heart and talking to so many believers \u2026 I just believe Jesus is coming soon \u2026 I just go to, you know, \u2018How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'\u201d\n\nHall continued, \u201cBecause we know that \u2026 the Word promises things, right? The Word\u2019s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.\u201d\n\nThe preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be \u201cwars, and rumors and wars\u201d and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s a quickening around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.\u201d\n\nHall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to \u201ctestify to the goodness of God\u201d \u2014 something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt would change the world overnight \u2026 just the testimony of the saints,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEven in Revelation, it says, \u2018We\u2019re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'\u201d\n\nThus, he hopes people\u2019s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel\u2019s power and sway to a watching world.",

This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including \u201cmembership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security\u201d and \u201cpropaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.\u201d\n\nOpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,\u201d the organization explained in part. \u201cThe government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.\u201d\n\nPlease be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.",

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.\n\nMost roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.\n\nAs church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.\n\nBy sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.\n\nThe main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.\n\nHundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.\n\nPastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.\n\n\"I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,\" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.\n\nCalvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nThey have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.\n\n\"God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,\" said Kumar.\n\nPastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.\n\n\"God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.\n\n\"It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,\" said Kumar.\n\nMillions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?\n\n\"Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,\" said Kumar.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.**\n\nThat practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.\n\nNarayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring \u2013 all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.\n\n\"We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,\" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.\n\nNagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.\n\n\"Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,\" Mendem said. \"God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.\"\n\nShe and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.\n\n\"In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,\" Kumar said. \"We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.\"\n\nCalvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.\n\n\"The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,\" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.\n\nMembers also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements \u2013 again, all for free.\n\nIn 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.\n\n\"I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,\" Kumar said.\n\nEach member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.\n\n\"Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,\" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. \"They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.\"\n\nPastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.\n\n\"During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,\" Kumar told CBN News. \"Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.\"\n\nEach month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a \"Night with God\" as members pray for revival.\n\n\"About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.\n\n\"The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,\" Kumar said.\n\nMost attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.\n\nPastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.\n\n\"No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,\" said Kumar. \"It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Comedian and famed political commentator Bill Maher predicted recently it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d former President Donald Trump will win the November election.\n\nHe went on to condemn the modern political left as \u201caggressively anti-common sense\u201d during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.\n\n\u201cPart of it the left has to own,\u201d he told Brown. \u201cThey are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It\u2019s OK to have penises in the women\u2019s swimming pool, in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m old; it\u2019s that your ideas are stupid.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\nMaher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to those people, you\u2019re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time \u2014 and they are \u2014 and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should keep the dialogue open,\u201d the HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host added.\n\nMaher recently appeared on the ABC talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.\n\n\u201cIf I had any doubt that I was right about the change that\u2019s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas \u2014 that straightened me out pretty quick,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to me that they can\u2019t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.\n\nIn what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.\n\nIn the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.\n\nThe Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'\n\n\n\nIn a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.\n\nThe original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.\n\nCritics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.\"\n\nTyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, \"This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state\u2014and the deep state\u2014accountable.\"\n\nThe Capitol Riot and Obstruction\n\nIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

        "body": "A last-minute peace deal could still possibly avert a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.\n\nBy the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.\n\nThat's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, \"Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.\"\n\nHezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.\n\n'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'\n\nAs the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.\n\nHe's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, \"On the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\nVisiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, \"The situation spirals out of control.\"\n\nExuberant Defiance of Terrorism\n\nEven as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.\n\nNimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.\n\nHe told the concert crowd, \u201cOn that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn\u2019t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.\"\n\nThe Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.\n\n'We Will Dance Again!'\n\nBut the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.\n\nAs concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, \"Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.\u201d\n\nNimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, \"In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\nREAD ISIS Network Helped 400 Cross US Border Illegally - Many of Them Are Now Missing\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "body": "ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming Fast\n\nThe hijab \u2014 the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women \u2014 is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.\n\nFor many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.\n\nChange is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.\n\nIt's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.\n\nThe raw emotion of the protests \u2014 including images of women publicly burning their hijabs \u2014 has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.\n\nExplosive Yearning\n\nThe protests, known as the \"Women, Life, Freedom Movement\", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.\n\nAnd the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.\n\nThe protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its \"morality police\" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.\n\nThis movement continues to gather momentum.\n\nIncreasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nThe change is not only social. It's religious, too.\n\nChristians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith \u2014 and those are just ones we know about.\n\nBut most Iranians don't see Christians as \"the enemy\" anymore.\n\nA generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.\n\nYet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.\n\nIllegal house churches \u2014 believers secretly meeting in homes \u2014 are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.\n\nA New Revolution\n\nBut new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's \"isolated\" believers.\n\nThey're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as T\u00fcrkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.\n\nThere's more to this new media revolution.\n\nSAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.\n\nSocial media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.\n\nA boy named Kaamran told us: \"The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.\"\n\nChange is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.\n\nIn fact, it's already here.\n\n--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and \"digital church\" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.\n\nThe official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.\n\nThe decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, \"This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.\"\n\nWATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban\n\nWhat the Case Is Really About\n\nThe Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.\n\nIdaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's \"health\" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.\n\nAnd the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent \"a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.\"\n\nDuring the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.\n\n\"One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,\" he said, \"is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'\"\n\nAlito pointed out, \"So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAbortion Leaks at the Supreme Court\n\nTwo years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\nThe Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.\n\n\n\nPro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, \"With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.\"",

        "body": "Human rights groups say 36,000 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the last two decades, including Mrs. Son, a former official of the North Korean military. During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.\n\n\n\nShe told CBN News, \"My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.\"\n\n\n\nIn order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.\n\n\n\n\"We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,\" Mrs. Son said.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.\n\n\"My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.\n\n\n\n\"Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.\"\n\n\n\nAfter yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.\n\n\n\n\"The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released\u2026 malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,\" Mrs. Son recounted.\n\n\n\nOnce in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.\n\nThe name of the church, \"Seopyoung\" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.\n\n\n\nRev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, \"It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.\"\n\n\"During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,\" he reports. \"Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.\"\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.\n\n\n\n\"I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,\" Mrs. Son said.",

They recently spoke with The Daily Wire\u2019s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.\n\nKnowles, a Catholic, described the couple\u2019s testimony as \u201cone of the wildest stories I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nIn addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,\u201d said Nic of their experience together. \u201cBut nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe world can tell you so much about who you\u2019re \u2018supposed to be\u2019 based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might \u2026 make you feel included for a time.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the \u201clie\u201d of the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe whole world in the queer community was saying, \u2018Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'\u201d she recalled hearing. \u201c[But] that argument doesn\u2019t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, \u2018God made me this way,\u2019 then that means that I should have been a woman.\u201d\n\nLex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging \u2014 something she had not previously found in her family or faith.\n\nShe grew up in an abusive household \u2014 one that claimed to be \u201cChristian\u201d \u2014 with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, \u201cIf I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,\u201d a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.\n\nEvery time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would \u201creject me.\u201d Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.\n\n\u201cI ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to walk with you through this journey.\u2019 But all I faced was rejection.\u201d\n\nNic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, \u201cnever tried to change me,\u201d even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God\u2019s design for males and females.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.\u201d\n\nInitially, as a transgender male \u2014 meaning biologically female \u2014 and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.\n\nThey currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.\n\nThe couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn\u2019t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.\n\n\u201cThey chose to love us,\u201d Lex said of the church they attended. \u201cAnd that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.\u201d\n\nIn March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,\u201d Lex wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cHe is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, \u2018I do,\u2019 after Pastor Ivan said, \u2018Do you take her to be your bride.\u2019 Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic\u2019s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.\n\n\"Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,\" The Times reports.\n\nThe administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.\n\nMore than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.\n\nLATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children\n\nCritics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.\n\nBut as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that \"children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.\"\n\nMORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'\n\nWhen we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, \"The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nMeanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed \"weak evidence\" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.\n\n\"This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,\" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. \"In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.\"\n\nThere is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.\n\nNew rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.\n\nPerformance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.\n\n\"Which Joe Biden's going to show up?\" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. \"My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.\"\n\nNathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. \"Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,\" Gonzales explained. \"Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.\"\n\nBiden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions\u2014a first for a presidential candidate\u2014and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.\n\nAides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.\n\nYet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu \"opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.\"\n\nThe prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.\n\nItamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.\n\n\"There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,\" Marcus stated. \"There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th \u2013 and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres \u2013 and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.\"\n\nPreparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays\n\nOn another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.\n\nIn Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.\n\nGallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. \"The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,\" the defense minister said.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. \"We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,\" Fetterman declared.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, \"It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.\"\n\nAntisemitism in NYC\n\nIn New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, \"Raise your hands if you're a Zionist \u2013 this is your chance to get out!\"\n\nEarlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.\n\nOne protester said of Bragg, \"He's either a coward or an antisemite.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Better Medicine than Pills and Surgery, Doctor Says\n\nAmericans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.\n\nAfter watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.\n\n\"She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,\" Dr. Means told CBN News.\n\nDitching Mainstream Medicine\n\nAfter becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.\n\n\"What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.\n\n\"This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nShe explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.\n\nDiet Matters Most\n\nDr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take \"an ultra-aggressive stance on diet\" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.\n\n\"The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,\" Dr. Means said. \"Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.\"\n\nAfter nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nAvoid Processed Foods\n\nDr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,\" she said. \"Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.\"\n\nShe advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The true story of Jose Hernandez is out-of-this-world.\n\nAs a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.\n\nNow, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called \"A Million Miles Away.\"\n\nHernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.\n\n\"The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,\" he said.\n\n\"When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,\" he continued.\n\nHernandez described his personal path to perseverance.\n\n\"I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,\" he told CBN News.\n\nFaith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,\" he told CBN News.\n\nMany are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.\n\n\"It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,\" he said.\n\nAs a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.\n\n\"My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,\" he continued.\n\nAs Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.\n\n\"A Million Miles Away\" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.\n\n",

        "body": "Reports of stunning mass baptisms are coming out of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where one Christian leader revealed that more than 300,000 people have been baptized this year into the Christian faith.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.\n\nThe outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.\n\nThe effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.\n\nWilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.\n\n\u201cThe latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in \u2018PNG for Christ\u2019 with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.\u201d\n\nHe followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.\n\nWilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the \u201cHoly Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nJust days before Wilson\u2019s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.\n\nWith so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people \u2014 an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers\u2019 desire to express their faith.\n\nThe impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of \u201cdrug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.\u201d\n\nPNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.\n\n\u201cIt is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,\u201d he told the Adventist Record. \u201cI would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nBe sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.\n\nCBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.\n\n\n\nScars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.\n\n\n\n\"When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you \u2013 but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,\" said Pastor Bailey.\n\n\n\nThe first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.\n\n\n\nAfter 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.\n\nPastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.\n\n\n\n\"I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'\" Pastor Bailey recounted. \"And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.\"\n\n\n\nVolunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.\n\n\"They came in with resources that blew our minds,\" said Bailey. \"They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.\"\n\nStephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.\n\n\"I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,\" said Robinson. \"But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.\"\n\nDespite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.\n\n\"And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,\" said Robinson.\n\nPastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.\n\n\"But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,\" said Pastor Bailey. \"I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.\n\nThe Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.\n\n\"We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,\" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.\n\nScala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.\n\n\"For academics, we look at it based purely on data,\" Scala explained. \"So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.\n\n\"We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,\" Scala said.\n\nIn the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.\n\n\"We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,\" Scala said.\n\nThis is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn\u2019t use foul language,'\u201d Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump claimed he has been working \u201cso hard\u201d to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues \u2014 which often run between one and two hours \u2014 make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.\n\nHe requested Graham allow him \u201cone or two\u201d curse words, because \u201cif you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t get the emphasis.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nTo show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump said, \u201cI was really good. I didn\u2019t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.\u201d\n\nThe likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: \u201cWhen I see people start to walk out, then we\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to use the word bull****,\u201d Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad a word.\u201d\n\nAs for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.\n\nIn 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver \u2014 a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\u201cThese ten, from [Trump\u2019s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,\u201d Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cIt makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.\u201d\n\nNews of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThere are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,\u201d he said in a statement shared with CBN News. \u201cWe know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out \u2014 whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.\n\n\"Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,\" Austin said Tuesday. \"And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.\"\n\nStill, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,\" Austin stated.\n\nYoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.\n\n\"The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,\" Gallant insisted.\n\nIn Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.\n\nFormer Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. \"And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,\" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. \"The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy \u2013 and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,\" Lipman said.\n\nAnd in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive \u201cSquad\u201d lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman\u2019s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "35 Years After Tiananmen, Escaped Spy Reveals How Beijing Hunts Dissidents in US: 'Constant Threats'",
        "body": "He is the first former member of China's secret police to speak publicly about Beijing's active campaign to silence Chinese pro-democracy voices overseas.\n\nCalling himself 'Eric,' he was an agent for China's Ministry of Public Security or 'First Bureau,' from 2008 until last year, when he defected to Australia.\n\nHe told CBN News, \"My job was to collect intelligence about the country I was in and the anti-communist groups there. I was supposed to infiltrate these groups, make friends, and trap targets for return to China.\"\n\nEric was coerced into becoming an agent in 2008 after his arrest for supporting a pro-democracy party and given a choice: help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) catch dissidents abroad or go to jail. He chose the former, taking on fake identities, such as a property executive and an anti-communist freedom fighter, to lure dissidents to countries where they could be abducted and returned to China.\n\nBut because he secretly protected targets and says no one was arrested because of his work, his handlers became suspicious, and he decided to defect.\n\n\"I did not want to be responsible for any targets being returned to China and tried to make sure that did not happen, and this made my bosses suspicious of me,\" Eric said.\n\nEric's testimony confirms our reporting and the reports of others that a Chinese government spy network is threatening, entrapping, and even kidnapping critics of the Chinese communist government.\n\nCBN News Coverage: China Is Operating Illicit Police Stations Inside the US - Why Are They Still Allowed to Be Here?\n\n\"These are kind of the methods being used by the CCP. This is not an allegation we're making. This is what their official documents state,\" says Laura Harth, who tracks Chinese transnational repression for the human rights group Safeguard Defenders.\n\nCCP Agents like Eric are known to operate in the U.S., but Harth says these agents are only one part of a larger campaign by the Chinese government, called \"The United Front.\"\n\n\n\n\"The United Front is something that's being defined by the Chinese Communist Party as one of its 'secret' or 'magic' weapons. And essentially its task is two things: On the one hand, expand the circle of friends of the Chinese Communist Party. So, co-opting or influencing, politicians, media, academia, and entrepreneurs. But on the other hand, its task is also to crack down on critics, to silence them, to divide them.\"\n\nREAD China's Big Brother 'Social Credit System' Now Tracks People in North America Too with Video Surveillance\n\n\n\nAn Amnesty International survey of Chinese students in 24 universities in Europe and North America found that many live in fear of surveillance, harassment, or intimidation by Chinese agents.\n\nDissidents sent us photos of Chinese police paying visits to their relatives and warning them they face trouble and even jail if their family member doesn't stop criticizing the Chinese government.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear how many of the so-called Chinese police stations used to control dissidents are still operating in the U.S. On paper, it might be less than five. The one we reported about above a noodle shop in New York City was finally shut down by authorities.\n\nHarth says, \"It's important to recognize that police stations or so-called police stations is really the tip of the iceberg. It's much more widespread than one, two or three single stations. We need to take a broad view and understand what the wider picture looks like and the amount of proxies and networks that the Chinese Party-state is operating.\"\n\n\n\nBob Fu, founder and president of the Texas-based ministry China Aid helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student. He still faces harassment by Chinese agents, 35 years later.\n\n\n\nFu told CBN News, \"In recent months, even I have been harassed and receiving threats, text messages and also CCP agents booked hotels under my name and then called the police, from New York to Los Angeles, from Washington, D.C. to Houston, basically for bomb threats, and said 'Bob Fu was about to set off bombs.'\"\n\nMUST SEE 'The Perfect Police State': China's Digital Dictatorship Goes Global\n\n\n\nPro-democracy activist Lijian Jie in Los Angeles, who Chinese agents have tried to kill three times, told us Chinese-Americans are \"still surrounded by constant threats of danger.\"\n\n\n\nIn a special message to his former colleagues still trying to harass and trap Chinese dissidents, Eric encouraged them to \"recognize the nature of the communist party,\" that \"it is a fascist totalitarian party,\" and that \"carrying out these illegal and secret activities in various countries is not good for you.\" He challenges them to instead \"do something good for human civilization.\"\n\n\n\nBeijing's continued repression of overseas Chinese begs the question, if those Chinese who have fled communism for freedom still live in fear of the Chinese Communist Party, are they really free?\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

The NAR said that reflected more sales of high-priced properties as well as multiple offers.\n\nAnd since the start of the year, the price of existing homes has been even steeper, jumping 10.8% from $378,600 in January.

        "body": "Indebted countries are vulnerable to a precipitous loss of confidence even though that risk is barely acknowledged in bond markets, the Bank for International Settlements warned.\n\nThe Basel-based institution said in its annual economic report released on Sunday that countries whose bloated fiscal positions are further stretched by higher interest rates should prioritize fiscal repair. Claudio Borio, head of the BIS\u2019s monetary and economic department, said they must act \u201cwith urgency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know from experience that things look sustainable until suddenly they no longer do,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat is how markets work.\u201d\n\nWhile the need to fix public finances has been a recurring theme for the BIS, the remarks coincide with heightened scrutiny on indebted economies. Worries about France this month prompted investors to demand the highest premium on its bonds since 2012.\n\nThe Basel officials didn\u2019t specify any country in particular, but they did feature a chart looking at the debt and market pricing of some of the world\u2019s biggest borrowers, including Japan, Italy, the US, France, Spain and the UK.\n\nIn order to stabilize finances, advanced economies can this year run deficits no larger than 1% of gross domestic product, down from 1.6% last year, the BIS said. That\u2019s a fraction of the current US deficit, which the International Monetary Fund described last week as \u201cmuch too large.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough financial market pricing points to only a small likelihood of public finance stress at present, confidence could quickly crumble if economic momentum weakens and an urgent need for public spending arises on both structural and cyclical fronts,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cGovernment bond markets would be hit first, but the strains could spread more broadly.\u201d\n\nInflation is subsiding however, BIS officials acknowledge. The world is currently set for a \u201csmooth landing,\u201d General Manager Agustin Carstens said.\n\nServices still pose a risk to that outlook, with prices in that area out of step with pre-pandemic trends, the report said. In addition, increases in the cost of commodities due to geopolitical tensions could reignite inflation.\n\nGiven these pressure points, officials highlighted that central banks should be cautious about cutting rates too soon. That could prove costly to their reputations if such policy needs to be reversed amid a flare-up of inflation again, the report said.\n\nPolicymakers already did their fair share to contribute to that problem, the BIS suggested, repeating its accusation that \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight,\u201d pandemic-era stimulus probably raised the risks of second-round effects.\n\nWhile central banks shouldn\u2019t ease too soon, governments also have a part to play with too-loose fiscal policy, officials said. Instead, they should widen tax bases and deliver structural reforms to meet future challenges including demographic shifts and climate change.\n\n\u201cOur main message is that central banks alone cannot deliver a durable increase in economic growth and prosperity,\u201d Borio said. \u201cLaying the foundation for a brighter economic future also requires actions from other policymakers, especially governments.\u201d",

        "title": "Superyachts aren't just for the super-rich: Hundreds of scientists use them",
        "body": "For almost two years, Robert Brewin collected data from the bow of a superyacht as it sailed pristine waters from the Caribbean Sea to the Antarctic Ocean.\n\nThe Archimedes, a 222-foot (68-meter) \u201cadventure\u201d yacht then owned by the late hedge funder James Simons, boasts a gym, a jacuzzi and an elevator. But between 2018 and 2020, Brewin was concerned only with the boat\u2019s Sea-Bird Scientific Solar Tracking Aiming System, installed to measure light reflecting off of the water. A senior lecturer at the UK\u2019s University of Exeter, Brewin and his colleagues were analyzing microplankton \u2014 microscopic organisms at the base of the marine food chain \u2014 by studying the ocean\u2019s color. The Sea-Bird\u2019s readouts helped them verify satellite imagery.\n\nBrewin\u2019s was not your typical superyacht itinerary, but he is one of hundreds of scientists to have used an adventure yacht \u2014 also known as expedition or explorer yachts \u2014 to conduct research on the ocean. In a paper published in January, Brewin and his co-authors touted the potential of \u201charnessing superyachts\u201d for science, concluding that \u201creaching out to wealthy citizen scientists may help fill [research capability] gaps.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared \u2014 and being pushed \u2014 by the Yacht Club of Monaco and the Explorers Club, a New York City-based organization focused on exploration and science (of which, full disclosure, I am a member). In March, the groups co-hosted an environmental symposium that included an awards ceremony for yacht owners who \u201cstand out for their commitment to protecting the marine environment.\u201d The Archimedes won a \u201cScience & Discovery\u201d award.\n\n\u201cIf a yacht is operating 365 days a year, rather than having it sit idle it\u2019d be much better for it to contribute a positive return through science and conservation,\u201d says Rob McCallum, an Explorers Club fellow and founder of US-based EYOS Expeditions, which runs adventure yacht voyages.\n\nEYOS charters yachts from private owners for its excursions, and is a founding member of Yachts for Science, a four-year-old organization that matches privately owned yachts with scientists who need time at sea. (Other members include yacht builder Arksen, media firm BOAT International, and nonprofits Nekton Foundation and Ocean Family Foundation.) Yachts for Science will enable about $1 million worth of donated yacht time this year, McCallum says, a figure he expects to hit $15 million by 2029.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a personal satisfaction that we are contributing to something that is bigger than us,\u201d says Tom Peterson, who co-owns an insurance underwriting company in California and has what he jokingly refers to as a \u201cmini superyacht.\u201d Every year for the past decade, Peterson has donated about 15 to 20 days of time and fuel on the 24-meter Valkyrie to scientists, who he takes out himself as a licensed captain and former scuba dive operator. He often works with the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach, and allows researchers to stay aboard for days at a time instead of having to constantly make the 1.5-hour trip to and from shore.\n\nTo link up with scientists, Peterson works with the International SeaKeepers Society, a Florida-based nonprofit that engages the yachting community to support ocean conservation and research. \u201cThe more we understand things about the ocean in general, the better we all are in the long run,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen \u201csuperyacht\u201d and \u201cthe environment\u201d appear in the same sentence, it\u2019s usually in a different context. In 2019, one study estimated that a single 71-meter superyacht has the same annual carbon footprint as about 200 cars. In 2021, another paper found that superyachts were the single greatest contributor to the carbon footprint of 20 of the world\u2019s most prominent billionaires, accounting for 64% of their combined emissions.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to respect the environment, you can just go surf,\u201d says Gr\u00e9gory Salle, a senior researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and author of the book Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Salle is open to the idea that superyachts could be used to advance scientific research, but says it\u2019s contradictory for anyone to buy a superyacht and claim to be truly concerned about the environment.\n\nMcCallum says people who own adventure yachts tend to be younger than your standard superyacht owner, and have a particular interest in remote and pristine places. \u201cThey\u2019re not the sort of people that are content to just hang out in the Mediterranean or the Caribbean,\u201d he says. \u201cAntarctica, the Arctic, the remote Indian Ocean, the remote Pacific Ocean, the Subantarctic islands\u2026 that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find us delivering our services.\u201d\n\nExplorer yachts aren\u2019t the only way scientists can reach those destinations, but demand for dedicated research vessels does outstrip available supply. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), arguably the world\u2019s greatest collector of oceanographic data, has a fleet of 15 research and survey vessels for the use of its scientists. Academic researchers can also apply to use the fleet, often at a subsidized rate. But scientists request roughly 15,000 to 20,000 days of boat time every year. In 2019, NOAA was able to fill just 2,300 of them, according to an internal study.\n\nThat gap is particularly problematic as the planet warms. Oceans provide services that scientists call \u201cexistentially important,\u201d producing more than half of the oxygen we breathe and serving as the world\u2019s largest carbon sink. They also absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them.\n\nG. Mark Miller, a retired NOAA Corps officer who was in charge of several of the agency\u2019s research vessels, has a different solution in mind when it comes to bolstering ocean research: smaller boats, fit for purpose. Superyachts can cost north of $500 million, he says; \u201cwhy don\u2019t we build a hundred $5 million vessels and flood the ocean science community?\u201d\n\nAfter leaving NOAA, Miller in 2021 launched Virginia-based Greenwater Marine Sciences Offshore with a vision of building a global fleet of research vessels and offering their use at affordable prices. He says hiring a NOAA boat can cost scientists between $20,000 and $100,000 per day. GMSO plans to charge less than $10,000 a day for most missions. The company says it\u2019s close to acquiring its first three vessels.\n\nMiller hopes his business model will help scientists conduct the work they need to \u2014 particularly in under-served regions like the Asia-Pacific \u2014 without worrying about getting a luxury yacht covered in \u201cmuddy worms, plankton goo, dead fish [and] whale snot.\u201d He describes yacht owners donating boat time to scientists as \u201cbetter than nothing,\u201d and says it can help get regular people interested in science and exploration.\n\nChristopher Walsh, captain of the Archimedes, says he and his crew love taking part in science initiatives, especially when there\u2019s an educational component. \u201cI get a real thrill when we can stream to the classrooms \u2014 you can\u2019t imagine the enthusiasm the kids display,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThat gives me a lot of hope for the future.\u201d",

        "body": "As Florida\u2019s ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is set to go into effect next week, one manufacturer hosted a last hurrah \u2014 at least for now \u2014 with a cultivated meat-tasting party in Miami.\n\nCalifornia-based Upside Foods hosted dozens of guests Thursday evening at a rooftop reception in the city\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, known for its street art, breweries, nightclubs and trendy restaurants.\n\n\u201cThis is delicious meat,\u201d Upside Foods CEO and founder Uma Valeti said. \u201cAnd we just fundamentally believe that people should have a choice to choose what they want to put on their plate.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. approved the sale of what\u2019s now being called \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat for the first time in June 2023, allowing Upside Foods and another California company, Good Meat, to sell cultivated chicken.\n\nEarlier this year, Florida and Alabama banned the sale of cultivated meat and seafood, which is grown from animal cells. Other states and federal lawmakers also are looking to restrict it, arguing the product could hurt farmers and pose a safety risk to the public.\n\nWhile Florida cattle ranchers joined Gov. Ron DeSantis when he signed the ban into law in May, Valeti said Florida officials never reached out to his company before passing the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to us that the governor and the government have been misinformed,\u201d Valeti said. \u201cAnd all we\u2019re asking for is a chance to have a direct conversation and say, \u2018this is proven science, this is proven safety.\u2019\u201d\n\nCultivated products are grown in steel tanks using cells from a living animal, a fertilized egg or a storage bank. The cells are fed with special blends of water, sugar, fats and vitamins. Once they\u2019ve grown, they\u2019re formed into cutlets, nuggets and other shapes.\n\nChef Mika Leon, owner of Caja Caliente in Coral Gables, prepared the cultivated chicken for Thursday\u2019s event, which invited members of the South Florida public to get their first, and possibly last, taste of cultivated meat before Florida\u2019s ban begins Monday. Leon served chicken tostadas with avocado, chipotle crema and beet sprouts.\n\n\u201cWhen you cook it, it sizzles and cooks just like chicken, which was insane,\u201d Leon said. \u201cAnd then when you go to eat it, it\u2019s juicy.\u201d\n\nReception guest Alexa Arteaga said she could imagine cultivated meat being a more ethical alternative.\n\n\u201cThe texture itself is a little bit different, but the taste was really, really good,\u201d Arteaga said. \u201cLike way better than I was expecting.\u201d\n\nAnother guest, Skyler Myers, agreed about the texture being different when eating a piece of meat by itself but said it just seemed like normal chicken when he ate the tostada.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no difference,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s no way you would ever know.\u201d\n\nBesides the ethical issues surrounding the killing of animals, Valeti said cultivated meat avoids many of the health and environmental problems created by the meat industry, such as deforestation, pollution and the spread of disease. He also noted that the meat his company produces is not coming from a lab but from a facility more closely resembling a brewery or a dairy processing plant.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any confined animals,\u201d Valeti said. \u201cWe just have healthy animal cells that are growing in cultivators.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions come despite cultivated meat and seafood still being too expensive to reach the market in a meaningful way. Two high-end U.S. restaurants briefly added the products to their menus, but it hasn\u2019t been available at any U.S. grocery stores. Companies have been working to bring down costs by scaling up production, but now they\u2019re also trying to respond to bans with petitions and possible legal action.\n\nSean Edgett, Upside Foods chief legal officer, said the company went through a yearslong process with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration before receiving approval. He said those federal regulations should supersede any state bans, which he believes are unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that if lawmakers can\u2019t change their mind and turn things around back to an avenue of progress that the courts will step in and make that clear,\u201d Edgett said.\n\nBackers of the bans say they want to protect farmers and consumers from a product that only has been around for about a decade.\n\nState Sen. Jay Collins, a Republican who sponsored the Florida bill, noted the legislation doesn\u2019t ban research, just the manufacturing and sale of cultivated meat. Collins said safety was his primary motivator, but he also wants to protect Florida agriculture.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not be in a rush to replace something,\u201d Collins said earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a billion-dollar industry. We feed a ton of people across the country with our cattle, beef, pork, poultry and fish industries.\u201d\n\nValeti isn\u2019t trying to replace any industry, just give people more options, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to have multiple choices that feed us,\u201d Valeti said. \u201cSome of those choices are conventional farming. Some of those choices are coming from plant-based foods. And cultivated meat is another solid choice.\u201d",
        "summary": "California-based Upside Foods hosted dozens of guests Thursday evening at a rooftop reception in the city\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, known for its street art, breweries, nightclubs and trendy restaurants.\n\u201cThis is delicious meat,\u201d Upside Foods CEO and founder Uma Valeti said.\nEarlier this year, Florida and Alabama banned the sale of cultivated meat and seafood, which is grown from animal cells.\n\u201cAnd then when you go to eat it, it\u2019s juicy.\u201dReception guest Alexa Arteaga said she could imagine cultivated meat being a more ethical alternative.\nAnd cultivated meat is another solid choice.\u201d",

        "body": "A sense of concern is growing inside the top ranks of the Democratic Party that leaders of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee are not taking seriously enough the impact of the president\u2019s troubling debate performance earlier in the week.\n\nDNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country, a group of some of the most influential members of the party. They largely ignored Biden\u2019s weak showing Thursday night or the avalanche of criticism that followed.\n\nMultiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being gaslighted \u2014 that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party\u2019s predicament. The call, they said, may have worsened a widespread sense of panic among elected officials, donors and other stakeholders.\n\nInstead, the people said, Harrison offered what they described as a rosy assessment of Biden\u2019s path forward. The chat function was disabled and there were no questions allowed.\n\n\u201cI was hoping for more of a substantive conversation instead of, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go out there and just be cheerleaders,\u2019 without actually addressing a very serious issue that unfolded on American television for millions of people to see,\u201d said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call. \u201cThere were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn\u2019t get that. We were being gaslit.\u201d\n\nMany donors, party strategists and rank-and-file DNC members are publicly and privately saying they want the 81-year-old Biden to step aside to allow the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. As of now, though, Biden\u2019s closest allies insist he remains well-positioned to compete against Republican Donald Trump and have given no indication they will push him to end his campaign.\n\nThose best positioned to replace him \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them \u2014 reiterated their support for Biden after the debate.\n\nMany are anxiously awaiting the first major round of post-debate public polling to determine their next steps.\n\nPolls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men\u2019s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s conviction on charges in New York that he illegally participated in a hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn a subsequent appearance on MSNBC, Harrison downplayed the significance of the conference call, which he said was part of a regularly scheduled communication \u201cto talk about the state of the race\u201d and the upcoming national convention with the DNC\u2019s many elected members across the country.\n\nBiden and his campaign have sought to project confidence in the days since Thursday\u2019s debate in which the president, who already faced serious concerns about his physical and mental stamina, offered a performance punctuated by repeated stumbles, uncomfortable pauses, and a quiet speaking style that was often difficult to understand.\n\nJust after Saturday\u2019s DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.\n\n\u201cOn every metric that matters, data shows it did nothing to change the American people\u2019s perception, our supporters are more fired up than ever, and Donald Trump only reminded voters of why they fired him four years ago and failed to expand his appeal beyond his MAGA base,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nShe added, \u201cIf we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Biden spent much of Saturday courting wealthy donors in New York\u2019s famed wealthy enclave of the Hamptons.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night, but neither did Trump,\u201d Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.\n\nOf Trump, Biden said, \u201cThe big takeaway was his lies.\u201d\n\nHarrison reinforced the president\u2019s message on the DNC call, which spanned roughly an hour. Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson, said the discussion was a regularly scheduled quarterly conference call with the committee\u2019s membership.\n\nThe topics included Biden\u2019s energetic North Carolina appearance the day after the debate and a fundraising surge that produced more than $27 million for the campaign between debate day through Friday evening, Muldavin said.\n\nHarrison did not ignore the debate altogether in his remarks, she said.\n\nHe briefly referenced Biden\u2019s comments from his North Carolina speech that he doesn\u2019t debate as well as he used to, but that he knows how to get up when he gets knocked down.\n\nSalazar noted that Harrison also suggested that party leaders always knew the 2024 presidential contest would be close, a regular Democratic talking point that irks Salazar.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a close race,\u201d Salazar said, pointing to Trump\u2019s criminal record and long history of falsehoods. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who should be looking for a new nominee, not us. And unfortunately for us, because of our president\u2019s performance on Thursday night, that is now an open discussion.\u201d",

        "title": "Lumber prices are plunging. Blame the record drop in U.S. housing affordability and a post-pandemic double bubble \u2018hangover\u2019",
        "body": "The twin-peaked lumber bubble of 2021 and 2022 that once drove home building costs through the roof and exacerbated inflation is now nothing more than a memory.\n\nSpot lumber prices have plummeted 75% from their May 2021 record high of $1,514 per thousand board feet to just $366 this week, roughly matching pre-pandemic levels, according to Random Lengths\u2019 Framing Lumber Composite Price Index. Lumber\u2019s price drop has been particularly dramatic in just the last 90 days in the futures market, with contract prices for July falling 28% to $466 per thousand board feet (futures prices are around $100 above spot prices due to a delivery fee).\n\nIndustry experts blame the record drop in U.S. housing affordability and a slowdown in home renovations for quashing lumber demand. It\u2019s just too expensive for consumers to buy new homes or renovate their current ones. That\u2019s led to fewer construction projects, and slowing lumber sales. Meanwhile, overly optimistic industry demand forecasts amid hopes for plunging interest rates and rising home sales have led lumber mills to increase supply at the worst possible moment.\n\nPut it all together and \u201cit\u2019s an ugly scenario\u201d for the lumber market, Ashley Boeckholt, director of lumber and risk management at Sitka Forest Products USA, told Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of having a hangover from a great three years.\u201d\n\nThe demand side: A record deterioration in housing affordability and a renovation slowdown\n\nThe factors behind lumber\u2019s price moves are varied and complex, but, as always, it all comes down to supply and demand. On the demand side, sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates have led to a record drop in U.S. housing affordability over the past few years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) Index is now at its lowest level since before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.\n\nAs a result, even with an ongoing housing shortage, demand for new homes has remained subdued, leading to similarly weak demand for lumber to build them. \u201cHousing affordability is just really offsides right now,\u201d Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist who leads Fastmarkets\u2019 Wood Products team, told Fortune. \u201cIt's one of the least affordable times to buy a house in decades and the pool of qualified buyers is starting to kind of dwindle a bit, too. So high interest rates eventually do start to bite.\u201d\n\nWeak demand for new homes led home builder confidence to drop to a five-month low last month, and housing starts fell 19% from a year ago. Most of that drop was the result of the 52% year-over-year plunge in multi-family housing starts. For a while, steady single-family home starts kept lumber prices from dropping significantly, because single-family homes use more wood than multi-family projects. But now that trend has flipped as well, with single-family housing starts down 2% year-over-year in May.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the critical home-renovation market, which boomed during the pandemic helping to lift lumber prices, is also showing signs of weakness. HomeDepot saw its U.S. comparable sales sink 3.2% in the first quarter, for example. One of the reasons for the drop was \u201csofter engagement in larger discretionary projects\u2026such as kitchen and bath remodels,\u201d Billy Bastek, the retailer\u2019s executive vice president of merchandising, noted on its May earnings call.\n\nBoeckholt, a veteran lumber trader who also hosts the weekly \u201cLumber Word\u201d podcast, said he is seeing evidence of declining lumber demand from retail buyers as well. Traders like him are starting to receive \u201cpremium\u201d lumber that is typically reserved for the Home Depots and Lowes of the world. \u201cThat generally means there's pushback\u201d from retail buyers at home goods centers, he noted.\n\nThis home renovation slowdown, when combined with the U.S.\u2019 long-running housing affordability challenges, has led to a serious lack of demand for wood products, particularly when compared to what was forecast just a year ago.\n\nThe supply-side: A hope-driven \u2018bullwhip\u2019 effect\n\nWhile the demand side of the lumber market is ailing, the supply side may be in an even worse position. After lumber prices surged in 2021 and 2022, the lumber industry responded by investing to increase production. Many lumber veterans saw a long-term opportunity for increased demand for their products due to the housing shortage; and like many Americans, they also anticipated imminent interest-rate cuts which tend to drive more near-term lumber demand.\n\nThe only issue with this plan, as Fastmarkets\u2019 Jalbert explained, is that it takes years to create new sawmills and increase lumber supply. This means that a lot of the new lumber supply that was commissioned during the pandemic is just now coming to market\u2014at a time when added supply is the last thing the industry needs.\n\n\u201cIt's a classic bullwhip,\u201d Jalbert noted. \u201cThe supply side [responds] in a like manner to demand, and by the time it comes to the market that demand picture is already changed\u2014and in this case in a negative way.\u201d\n\nBoeckholt backed up Jalbet\u2019s argument, saying it\u2019s an example of the \u201changover\u201d the lumber market is experiencing after its highly profitable pandemic years led to too much \u201chope\u201d for more demand. That\u2019s especially true \u201cdown in the southern U.S., where there have been mills in a pipeline to build for three or four years that have finally been coming on over the last year,\u201d he said, adding that there was also a lot of investment into older mills to increase production in many regions nationwide.\n\nWhat to expect from lumber prices through year-end 2024\n\nWhen it comes to what to expect for the rest of this year, Boeckholt warned that lumber prices may languish near their current, pre-pandemic levels, with the potential for a minor\u2014roughly $50\u2014price increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cThere was a lot of hope out there, so when we wash all that hope out\u2014which we will, eventually\u2014that's when we'll bottom,\u201d he said.\n\nJalbert also believes lumber prices will likely stagnate through year-end 2024, but in 2025, he argues things could turn around. Some sawmills will be forced to slow or shut down production due to depressed lumber prices in the second half of this year, lowering lumber supply\u2014\u201cthe bullwhip in the opposite direction.\u201d\n\nThat, coupled with interest rate cuts that could stoke lumber demand, will likely lead lumber futures prices to a range between $500 and $600, or slightly above pre-pandemic levels, according to Jalbert. \u201cSupply is going to be cut and demand will recover,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that's going to take time.\u201d",

        "title": "How Hero Cosmetics\u2019 CEO made once-shameful pimple patches a Gen Z status symbol",
        "body": "Ju Rhyu can be your hero.\n\nThe cofounder and CEO of Hero Cosmetics might be best known for Mighty Patch, the ubiquitous barely-there pimple patch you may see on people\u2019s faces everywhere from the grocery store, to the office, to a night on the town.\n\n\u201cWhen you have acne, you feel more insecure, you feel more introverted, you feel like everyone is staring at your face,\u201d Rhyu, 45, told Fortune. \u201cThe products and solutions we offer really do work and really do save the day. It was really important for me to have something punchy, positive, and emotional.\u201d\n\nHero emerged after Rhyu\u2019s two-year stint in Korea for work, a country where skincare is decades ahead, and where pimple patches in public have been entirely normalized. With a pair of cofounders at her side and just $50,000, Rhyu sold her first set of Mighty Patches on Amazon for $12.99 in 2017. By 2022, the brand had notched $100 million in sales, and was acquired by consumer products powerhouse Church and Dwight for $630 million.\n\nIn the latest installment of Secrets to Success, Rhyu told Fortune how her time at Fortune 500 brands informed her leadership, why she puts her pimple patches in the cosmetic aisle (rather than their natural home in the Band-Aid aisle), what Korean skincare knows that American beauty doesn\u2019t, and why her company keeps its branding simple and translucent instead of neon and star-shaped.\n\nThe following transcript has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nWhat is Hero Cosmetics?\n\nIt\u2019s a functional skin solutions brand focused on acne. We\u2019re best-known for the \u201cmoney patch\u201d hydrocolloid acne patches.\n\nWhere did you grow up, and what did your parents do?\n\nI grew up in Seattle, Washington. My dad was a pretty successful entrepreneur, and I grew up with that inspiration in my life, and it fed a lot of my desire to be an entrepreneur one day.\n\nWe were very comfortable. My dad was in the log-export business. He was a log broker, which is why we lived in Seattle, Washington. He also did a few things in real estate, and he was very business-minded. I always grew up with the desire and the ambition to follow in his footsteps and try to be as financially successful as possible.\n\nIn high school, I played tennis, I was on my high school tennis team and I worked at the tennis club where I was taking lessons. I had the usual odd jobs here and there. I did sales, for example, at a department store during my summers away from college.\n\nI went to college at Brown University and I studied history and international relations. I actually tried to start a business while I was in college, a design agency called Three P\u2019s. So again, I think that [entrepreneurial] desire was always there, but I never really had that strong idea until Hero Cosmetics.\n\nMy first professional job after college was at a nonprofit called the Epiphany School, a charter school in Dorchester, Massachusetts. I worked in a fundraising capacity in the Development Office, which actually, at the end of the day, is really a sales and marketing job. That was my first job.\n\nI actually graduated into two recessions, the first one being in 2001, and the second one being in 2008. My career has definitely not been linear. After that nonprofit job, right after undergrad, I wanted to go into business. I didn\u2019t want to do something in marketing. That\u2019s when I ended up applying to Columbia Business School.\n\nI started in 2006, and then I did my internship at Kraft Foods, Mondelez, in consumer packaged goods. I did an internship in brand management. I worked on the Planters Peanuts brand. From there, I went full-time at American Express. And then I got recruited to work for Samsung in Korea as an expat for two years. That experience of living in Korea for two years is where I first used a hydrophilic acne patch, which eventually became the inspiration for my new passion, Hero Cosmetics.\n\nI always joke that I worked at some of the world\u2019s biggest brands\u2014Kraft Foods, Mondelez, American Express, and Samsung Electronics\u2014and then ended up starting an indie skincare brand.\n\nHydrocolloid patches were very popular in Korea?\n\nThis was back in 2012 and 2014. Those are the two years I spent in Korea\u201412 years ago. I was 35. Korea is really known in the beauty industry to be very ahead of the curve in terms of beauty, innovation, and adoption.\n\nBack in 2012, people were already wearing them out in public. I would see people wearing them at the office, and I asked them what they were for and was told that they were for breakouts. I was suffering from a bunch of breakouts at that time.\n\nI went to a pharmacy, I tried one, and it changed my skincare routine because it works so much better than anything I had used before. I put it on at night, and by morning, it got all that gunk out. My breakout was visibly and noticeably improved. Immediately I knew more people needed to know about it. And I actually saw from some of my research that people were wanting this type of product, so that became the inspiration for what is now Mighty Patch.\n\nWhat was the branding like for the patches in Korea? Were they specifically branded for your face?\n\nThere were a lot of options back then. You could find some at pharmacies that were more medical or clinical-oriented. And then there were some you could buy at Olive Young, which is the Korean version of Sephora, which were a little bit more fun and cosmetic- and beauty-oriented. So there were two types of brands out there.\n\nGrowing up, I always had occasional breakouts. I never had severe acne, but at the worst moments, I would always have that breakout in the most embarrassing place on my face, like right on my nose or between my eyebrows. Like most people, I was always searching for a solution to get a better handle on my breakouts and acne.\n\nI used every single possibility out there. I went to dermatologists, used toothpaste, used the pink creams, and nothing really worked, because a lot of those products can actually be very drying on your skin. That\u2019s why I really love the hydrocolloid acne patches because they are tough on the problem but gentle on your skin\u2014and they\u2019re just so easy to use and very effective.\n\nPrior to finding out about these patches, were you ever into dermatology before?\n\nI wasn\u2019t really into beauty or skincare. I actually learned about it a lot when I lived in Seoul for those two years. I learned about double cleansing and the different types of products and formats. My education started when I lived there, and then of course, now I\u2019m in the beauty world, so I pay attention quite a bit.\n\nWhy do you position the patches in the beauty section instead of the Band-Aid section?\n\nI credit a lot of my success at Hero Cosmetics to my corporate experience. I learned a lot of things at Kraft Foods and Mondelez and American Express that I really still use to this day. One of them is really paying attention to consumer behavior.\n\nOne of the consumer behaviors I noticed was that the hydrocolloid-patch format was actually already around for quite a long time, but they were in the Band-Aid aisle. And if you think about it, your breakout can be considered a type of wound, but there was nothing, at that time, in the beauty section.\n\nAnd really the idea was, can we take this hydrocolloid bandage that sits in the Band-Aid aisle, and make something very specific to acne? I had already seen that people were buying the big bandages and cutting them up into small squares or small shapes and putting them all over their face. The behavior was already there; people were buying them in one aisle, but using them for a beauty concern. And that was really the insight of, hey, I think we can turn this into a beauty product and really market something that\u2019s specific for acne.\n\nHow did you end up creating your first product?\n\nI created the first product pretty quickly, actually. I had contacted more than 10 hydrocolloid-patch manufacturers while I was in Korea, but only two responded. Of those two, the one that we ended up working with, we still work with today. They\u2019re obviously a really important partner to our business, and we worked with them to really develop what is now known as the Mighty Patch.\n\nHow old were you when the first product came out?\n\nWe launched the business in 2017. I was around 37.\n\nHow much did you start out selling your products for?\n\nWe priced our initial product, which was the 36-count Mighty Patch, at $12.99. The pricing actually was kind of an accident, because we were selling on Amazon, and there were already some players that were a lot cheaper\u2014around $5. And I actually wanted to price our products at $9.99.\n\nBut the funny story is we couldn\u2019t get Amazon Prime, and we were playing around with different things to see how we could unlock Prime. One of the ways was to increase our price to $12.99, and then that pricing just stuck.\n\nWhy did you decide to start selling them on Amazon?\n\nIt was strategic, but also a very practical decision. Back then, I didn\u2019t really know that Amazon was poo-pooed upon by a lot of players in the beauty industry. But for us, I saw that the consumer was already buying this type of product on Amazon.\n\nSo again, there were a few other acne-patch players on Amazon at the time\u2014not as many as today\u2014but I saw that people were buying this type of product on Amazon, and the demand and the behavior was there. So it made a lot of sense for us to try it out. It was also the easiest, fastest, and cheapest, and we were bootstrapped.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take a lot of money, investment, or resources to get up and running. You can get up and running, probably, in a day if you have the right images and copy. Amazon was a place for us to test and learn and to validate the thesis that people would really be into this type of product and this type of brand.\n\nYou mentioned there were a few other acne patch players; why do you think Mighty Patch in particular became so successful?\n\nWe\u2019re still, even to this day, the number-one acne patch brand in the US. I think we have a superior product. We own a very special formula, and people can discern the difference between ours and our competition.\n\nWe have a brand that really resonates with a lot of people because it\u2019s very inclusive and emotional. A lot of people can identify with our messaging and content. In the beginning, we actually only launched the patches, but I wanted to expand out very quickly into different product types.\n\nI wanted to do a wash-off face mask, but someone told me to stick to patches, and do them in every shape, and every size for every need\u2014just dominate this category. And I thought she was right, so that\u2019s what we did. I think that expertise in this one category really led us to create a lot of trust, and it\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019re still number one.\n\nHow long did it take for your products to sell out?\n\nThe first purchase order for the brand was around 10,000 units, which we sold through in about 90 days. The launch and the uptick for us was pretty quick.\n\nCan you describe your customer base?\n\nIt\u2019s predominantly women. When we started Hero Cosmetics, the branding was actually very gender-inclusive. That was very intentional, because I wanted this brand to be for anybody and everybody who broke out. It wasn\u2019t just for women, it wasn\u2019t just for men. It was really for everybody. But interestingly, as we launched and built the business, the primary consumer ended up being more female. I don\u2019t have the latest stats, but I think it\u2019s around 75% female. They still are the largest consumer of most beauty brands and beauty products, ours included.\n\nHow did you fundraise to start the company?\n\nWe actually did not fundraise. Back in 2017, that was very against the grain. I tell people that sometimes zigging when others are zagging can work to your benefit. Back then, large funding rounds and raising VC dollars was very trendy. We did not do that; we decided to bootstrap.\n\nWe have two co-founders, and all three of us put our own money into the business. The philosophy was: This business needs to stand on its own two feet. This product needs to be cash flow positive and profitable. So we were very, very efficient with our dollars. In total, I think we launched with about $50,000 between us.\n\nSome other companies have now created acne patches with a very bright design? What\u2019s Hero\u2019s strategy behind keeping its patches transparent?\n\nThere is a lot of competition in the category now, and I actually credit a lot of it to our success. Some brands have colors and shapes and are more fun. We haven\u2019t done that; we maintain that transparent, more discreet patch format.\n\nWe\u2019ve done that very intentionally to be inclusive and accommodate everyone, from the 14-year-old to people in their 50s. I think the way that we can do it is to be discreet. We acknowledge that the bright colors and shapes may work for some people, but it won\u2019t work for everybody. We launched with the more translucent, discreet patches, and we\u2019re the experts in it. That\u2019s sort of our thing.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned that you believe a lot of these other companies created pimple patches due to Mighty Patch\u2019s success.\n\nMy thoughts on competition are: A rising tide lifts all boats. I think we\u2019re all creating this category together. It\u2019s a new category, a new product format, and I welcome other players because the education they do in the marketplace really helps us all.\n\nIt\u2019s become pretty common to see people wearing patches out in public. Why do you think people are feeling so comfortable doing so?\n\nWhen I see people wearing acne patches out in public, I actually feel really proud about what we\u2019ve done. I was really trying to make acne more acceptable and really talk more positively about acne and understanding that it\u2019s no big deal. So many Americans, and really people all over the world, break out from time to time.\n\nI think over 60 million Americans will have acne at some point. So I love seeing people wear them to the office or just out and about, because I think what it means to me is we\u2019ve done our job and broken down the taboo aspect of acne and made it okay to be almost proud of it.\n\nIt\u2019s also very popular for people to wear pimple patches on social media. What\u2019s that impact been on the business?\n\nSocial media, for us, obviously has been such a key factor in our rise as a brand and as a business. Especially in terms of educating the market, because, again, it\u2019s a new product category and a new product format and education was really key. So social media, Instagram and TikTok\u2014we call it the magic moment. The magic moment is when you peel off the patch and can show how well it works on social media. That shock factor of, oh my god, look at all that gunk. That type of content goes viral a lot, and that virality helps with education. Social media, obviously, has been so crucial to the success of our business.\n\nWhat was the process of creating the Mighty Patch formula? How many tests did you have to go through until you found the perfect one?\n\nWe relied a lot on our manufacturer for the formula, which many beauty brands do. It was a formula that has been perfected over the years. Every brand has their own formula for making the hydrocolloid gel, and we found what we felt was the right balance in terms of adhesion, and efficacy, and something that was discreet enough to be wearable in public. I think we landed on the right one.\n\nWhy and how did you choose the name Hero Cosmetics?\n\nWhen we were starting the brand, it was really important to me that we have a name that was both emotional and positive, because from my personal experience, when you have acne, you feel more insecure, you feel more introverted, you feel like everyone is staring at your face. And the products and solutions we offer really do work and really do save the day. It was really important for me to have something punchy, positive, and emotional.\n\nWhen we came up with Mighty Patch, I just knew that was a perfect name. It connected the power and the strength and was sort of whimsical. The Hero Cosmetics name is because we wanted our products to be the \u2018hero products\u2019 in people\u2019s everyday skincare routines.\n\nWhen did you actually start creating different products?\n\nI never wanted Hero to be just a patch business or patch brand. It\u2019s funny; the downside of being so strong in this patch category is sometimes people think that our brand name is Mighty Patch. But actually, the brand name is Hero and Mighty Patch is just a product, and we do have other products. I always wanted to create an acne brand and acne-care brand that was a full solution.\n\nFor a daily-care treatment, we have something that we refer to as \u201cRepair and Restore.\u201d And actually, what we see in our business is that most people come through the Mighty Patch franchise. We acquire brands through the Mighty Patch product, but a lot of people are so satisfied with that experience that we ended up cross-selling and upselling across our portfolio.\n\nBut we do have a suite. We have a toner, we have a cleansing balm, we have the rescue balm franchise, and we have a lot of other products. And so we welcome people through Mighty Patch, and then we introduce them to the other suite of products from there on.\n\nI never wanted Hero Cosmetics to be just a patch business or a patch brand. Mighty Patch is our most well-known franchise. We did start with them. We are the experts in this category. It\u2019s amazing to see how we built the Mighty Patch as an acquisition engine into the brand for consumers and it lets us introduce them to our entire suite of other products.\n\nDo you have a perspective on work-life balance?\n\nI think when you\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s less about balance, and more about work-life integration. For example, I was living in Paris for six years. And there\u2019s a six-hour time difference between New York, where our business is based, and Paris. Luckily, over there, we ate late, at 8pm. But I would not take meetings or calls after dinner. I told the team, I\u2019d respond to emails or Slacks, but I wouldn\u2019t take calls.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s really just about finding a schedule that works for you. It\u2019ll be different for everyone. I don\u2019t think we can expect anyone to be on all the time, 24/7. Setting those guardrails is healthy for everybody.\n\nWhat\u2019s your philosophy on remote work? Do you find it challenging to have a group of predominantly remote employees?\n\nI like remote work. I work from home, but I do go to the New York office from time to time. My philosophy is that you need a balance of both. I would find it difficult if you\u2019re 100% remote all the time, because I think culture is really important, and it\u2019s hard to build culture online.\n\nThe other thing I don\u2019t like about remote work is that I don\u2019t get to build relationships with people. If you\u2019re just on a screen, I don\u2019t really talk to you, which, to me, is kind of sad. But when I go to the office, I love having casual watercooler conversations, like: What did you do this weekend? Any new restaurants you\u2019ve checked out? I love doing that with people who I might not have meetings with on a daily basis. For me, it\u2019s both. I think both are great.",

        "title": "Finding Your Best Sleep: Lessons learned from guided Headspace course",
        "body": "I still don\u2019t know how the \u201cEnchanted Moonlight Library\u201d sleepcast episode ends. Which, I suppose, is the point. A sleepcast is exactly what it sounds like: a podcast intended to help you doze off. Or, perhaps I have heard \u201cthe end\u201d and never knew it; Headspace, the mental health app housing the audio content, slightly remixes its bedtime stories nightly so anxious sleepers like me can\u2019t track time by memorizing the narrative. (Sneaky, but effective, I can confirm.)\n\nI began Headspace\u2019s 18-session Finding Your Best Sleep course in April, seeking strategies to quiet my worry-prone mind and fall asleep more quickly. The lessons, which include brief videos and guided meditations, are spread across three modules: Understand your sleep; Try something new; and Practice, practice, practice.\n\nFor roughly 10 minutes a night for nearly three weeks, I embraced all the materials the program had to offer\u2014even optional bonus videos that didn\u2019t pertain to me, including ones on sleeping comfortably while pregnant and navigating shift work. This added perspective helped me triage my sleep habits and what I hoped to improve.\n\nWhile not part of the course, the 45-minute-long sleepcasts are included with membership, along with other bedtime tools such as:\n\nNighttime SOS: I utilized this feature a few times when I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn\u2019t fall back asleep. The guided exercise track \u201cRacing Mind SOS\u201d came in handy.\n\nI utilized this feature a few times when I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn\u2019t fall back asleep.

White noise and sleep sounds: The delicate frequency of green noise works every time.\n\nThe delicate frequency of green noise works every time. Wind downs: \u201cDeep Rest\u201d is the track for me after a stressful day.\n\nHeadspace costs $12.99/month with a weeklong free trial, or $5.83/month billed as $69.99/year with a two-week free trial. Postsecondary students can join for 83 cents/month billed as $9.99/year.\n\nBy design, not every tool featured in Finding Your Best Sleep worked for me. Worry time, for instance, the practice of confining your worries to a dedicated chunk of time each day, only made me more restless. The goal of the course was to discover the best sleep hygiene for me, and that it did. Here are five of my favorite sleep strategies I learned from Headspace.\n\nSafeguard your sleep\n\nThe program encouraged me to put into practice something I\u2019ve long known to be true: When I sleep better, life is better.\n\nAdults ages 18\u201360 need at least seven hours of sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If I get fewer than eight, getting through the next day is akin to wading through mud. With proper rest, I\u2019m a better daughter, sister, friend, and employee. I\u2019m not only more productive at home and work, but also kinder and happier.\n\nWhy, then, is achieving this crucial wellness component so difficult? The course urged me to not prioritize sleep but safeguard it\u2014to respect it, protect it, and arrange the rest of my life to accommodate it instead of the other way around.\n\nSleep is a simple sacrifice when it seems there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to accomplish what needs to be done. Sometimes I still have to force myself to put aside whatever task feels like it can\u2019t wait in order to put sleep first. And as if by magic, a solid night\u2019s sleep gifts me time back the next day in the form of increased energy and efficiency.\n\nSleep space is sacred\u2014including the bed\n\nI knew that a calming bedroom environment is critical to restful sleep. Catching z\u2019s in a cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable place is ideal, the CDC says. TVs in the bedroom are frowned upon, and screen time should be cut off at least 30 minutes before bedtime, especially when blue light is involved.\n\nHeadspace, however, stresses that the bed itself should be off-limits to just about anything other than sleeping. That means no eating, working, or doomscrolling in bed. That way, your brain associates the bed with sleep\u2014not meals, emails, or social media.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there, but neither should your bed be a place you toss and turn in mental agony, mulling over yesterday\u2019s mistakes and tomorrow\u2019s to-do list. If trying to fall asleep makes your thoughts race and you\u2019re still awake after 20 minutes or so, Finding Your Best Sleep recommends getting out of bed and doing a relaxing activity in another room until you\u2019re sleepy.\n\nHeadspace\u2019s Finding Your Best Sleep course teaches that your bed is for sleeping\u2014not eating, working, or watching TV. Tetra Images/Getty Images\n\nA good night\u2019s sleep begins in the morning\n\nTaking time each night to prepare for the next morning was already second nature to me; laying out my gym clothes and packing a lunch makes for a less hectic start to the day. But before Headspace, I hadn\u2019t considered how I could prepare for a good night\u2019s sleep throughout the day.\n\nBecause your wake-up time keeps your circadian rhythm, or body clock, in check, merely waking up at a consistent time every morning\u2014yes, including weekends\u2014primes you for falling asleep at your preferred bedtime. Sunlight exposure in the morning helps, too.\n\nI\u2019m not typically an afternoon coffee drinker, but intentionally limiting my lattes to before noon helps me wind down earlier in the evening. I also now eat dinner earlier to allow more time for digestion before bed. I\u2019ve become more diligent about making my bed in the morning, which makes the evening turn-down a kind of ritual. I\u2019ve even started laying out my pajamas in the morning and look forward to finding other ways to make my nights easier during the day.\n\nSettle in with a story\n\nThanks, Mom, for always reading me to sleep; I\u2019ve kept the security blanket of storytelling close. Yet when I read from my Kindle or iPad in bed, even on dark or warm-light mode, I\u2019m still staring at a screen with distractions a tap away. Reading a physical book means my bedside lamp stays on, and when I listen to an audiobook in the dark, I find myself straining my ears to stay awake and listen.\n\nThis is where Headspace\u2019s sleepcasts save the day. I still enjoy reading in the evening, but once I\u2019m in bed, it\u2019s time for a deliberately dozy story, one pleasant enough that it can take my mind off things but insubstantial enough that I don\u2019t mind falling asleep in the middle of it. My favorite part is that each sleepcast starts with a wind-down meditation to calm the body before luring the mind into story.\n\nWork hard, sleep hard\n\nI don\u2019t mean you have to tire yourself out to deserve decent sleep\u2014though without fail I sleep better the night following a workout. Rather, Headspace has taught me to work hard at sleeping well. Sleep is at once a vital bodily function and a fragile goal to be attained.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much for my sleep routine to get off track, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019ve seamlessly and consistently integrated the hacks I\u2019ve learned into my sleep hygiene these past few months. The nights I did manage to, though, were followed by brighter days. Which reminds me, it\u2019s time to go pick out tonight\u2019s jammies.\n\nFor more on building healthy sleep habits:",

        "title": "The shocking $4.7 billion ruling against the NFL could disrupt the balance of power between the league and its teams",
        "body": "The NFL has rarely been a loser on the field, but a lopsided blowout in an antitrust lawsuit could change how the world\u2019s richest sports league generates and distributes billions of dollars in revenue every year.\n\nA Los Angeles jury on Thursday sided with fans who claimed the league conspired with DirecTV to raise the price of subscriptions to watch games broadcast out of their team\u2019s home market. The $4.7 billion in damages could be tripled under federal law.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game is over.\n\nThe judge could potentially slash the verdict or even throw it out entirely and rule in the NFL\u2019s favor. He didn\u2019t look favorably on the fans\u2019 arguments during the trial, and he dismissed the case back in 2019 before it turned into a class action. Post trial motions are set for July 31.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real serious problem, but there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive who helped to negotiate the network\u2019s deals with the NFL. \u201cAs far as the bigger picture goes and the NFL\u2019s place in the media landscape and their value, it\u2019s not going to stop them. They are going to keep rolling on.\u201d\n\nIf the verdict stands, the NFL said it will appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, prolonging a case that dates back to 2015. The Mucky Duck bar in San Francisco filed the original lawsuit, arguing that the NFL\u2019s Sunday Ticket forced viewers to pay for out-of-market games even when their team wasn\u2019t playing \u2014 and charged high prices for it. In other words, as a fan you must buy the rights to every game on a Sunday, not just when your team plays.\n\nThe jury took less than a day of deliberations to decide that was unfair. The verdict is a shock to how sports are offered to consumers, and a major blow to the NFL, so used to having the Midas touch. Even though it will appeal, the league has to plan for the potential costs of losing.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how much cash the NFL has. As a private company, it doesn\u2019t share its finances. Back in 2010, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell set a revenue target of $25 billion by 2027.\n\nRight now, one way to estimate the NFL\u2019s revenue puts it at about $12 billion, according to the annual statement of the Green Bay Packers, the only NFL team that publishes its finances. Each of the 32 teams get the same amount from the NFL, and the Packers got $374.4 million in 2022, the last available figures.\n\nFIFA, the world soccer body, is the only other sports organization that competes with the NFL in terms of money, at least during a World Cup year. It made over $6 billion from the Qatar World Cup in 2022. It has about $4 billion in cash reserves.\n\nIf FIFA has that much cash, you can assume that the NFL at least has the ability to save up and pay the verdict, but it will take some time. So will the appeal.\n\nPower Shift\n\nThe next issue \u2013 assuming the verdict isn\u2019t overturned \u2014 could be a power shift between the NFL and its teams.\n\nThe NFL has kept its members happy by signing massive TV deals that makes everyone rich. The NFL will get $110 billion from its 11-year TV deal signed in 2021.\n\nThe NFL has always been special. In 1961, congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act, after a US district court ruled the NFL was breaking antitrust rules by pooling rights in a deal with CBS.\n\nThe Act allowed the NFL to bundle all the teams\u2019 rights together to make the league economically viable. But the Act focused on broadcast deals, while the Mucky Duck lawsuit focused on whether the NFL broke antitrust laws with the Sunday Ticket package offered by DirecTV, a satellite provider.\n\nIf the verdict stands, teams could be granted the opportunity to sell their local rights and out-of-market games on cable or even a streaming service. The temptation could be strengthened if the NFL tried to pass on the cost of the fine to each team \u2014 a potential hit that could be anywhere from $150 million to $450 million.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a free market, and the hope is that it will create more opportunity for people to view the NFL product,\u201d said Sarah Hartley, a sports law lecturer at the University of Virginia School of Law and a partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. But she also cautioned that legal process is far from over.\n\nYouTube\n\nStarting in 2023, YouTube replaced DirecTV as the home of Sunday Ticket. It pays the NFL $2 billion a year and it charges customers $349. Even though the case didn\u2019t involve YouTube, it\u2019s hard to tell if the streaming platform will be better off giving more money to a team with a bigger fan base, and viewers. It\u2019s also hard to know whether team owner thinks they can strike a better deal on their own.\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones admitted as much during the trial. \u201cI\u2019m convinced I would make a lot more money than the Bengals,\u201d he said on the stand. It got some laughs.\n\nJones is arguably the architect for the NFL being funded by TV revenues. Back in 1992, CBS and NBC actually lost money on NFL broadcasts. The NFL broadcast committee wanted to give the networks millions in rebates. Jones said no, brought in a new network called Fox, and started a bidding war.\n\nWhen Jones fought back against the rebate, he was a new owner after buying the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million. It\u2019s now worth billions. There are now new owners looking to make their own mark.",

        "body": "The two largest golf cart producers in the US are asking for relief from an existential hazard: a flood of Chinese imports.\n\nClub Car LLC and Textron Specialized Vehicles Inc., both based near Augusta, Georgia, asked the Biden administration this week to slap a 100% tariff on golf carts and other low-speed, often battery-powered personal vehicles made in China \u2014 putting them on par with the US tariff on regular Chinese electric automobiles.\n\n\u201cChinese import volumes have rapidly increased, taking greater consumer vehicle market share while using price benefits from Chinese government subsidies to drive their advantage,\u201d Club Car President and CEO Mark Wagner said in an emailed statement Friday. \u201cWe had to take action.\u201d\n\nUS imports of Chinese golf carts and other recreational buggies have increased sixfold since 2020, partly because they\u2019re shipped under a product classification where the tariff is lower than those coded as normal-sized EVs. The Chinese carts often avoid higher levies by crossing the border at the lower tariff rate and then undergoing modifications in the US, according to the American companies\u2019 attorneys.\n\nAs a result, the golf carts and similar vehicles \u201care able to skirt the proposed increased duties on electric vehicles\u201d announced by the Biden administration in May, according to a letter filed this week with the US Trade Representative in Washington.\n\nThe skirmish between the world\u2019s largest economies is narrow, but it illustrates the scores of loopholes, workarounds, unintended consequences and legal quandaries that accompany the imposition of tariffs across a swath of the economy.\n\nComment Deadline\n\nFriday was the deadline for public comment on USTR\u2019s so-called 301 case, under which tariffs on Chinese goods are justified.\n\nThe filing from Club Car and Textron, which makes E-Z-GO and Cushman carts, was among hundreds of other pleas for either tariff protection or relief posted during USTR\u2019s comment window. The two companies made their case jointly under a group called the American Personal Transportation Vehicle Manufacturers Coalition.\n\nAccording to the filing, imports of Chinese golf carts and another tariff classification for similar products called \u201cspecially designated vehicles\u201d totaled $916 million last year, up from $148 million in 2020.\n\nClub Car and Textron\u2019s competitors in China have \u201csubstantially and systematically undersold domestically produced\u201d vehicles, \u201cresulting in a deterioration in the domestic industry\u2019s performance and a sharp decline in the US industry\u2019s production, capacity utilization, shipments, employment, and financial performance in 2024,\u201d according to the June 25 letter to USTR from the Wiley law firm in Washington.\n\nTheir outreach to USTR follows a related case filed with the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission, which alleged dumping of Chinese golf carts and sought relief in the form of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\n\nRobert DeFrancesco, a partner in Wiley\u2019s international trade practice, said the process in that case will take about a year.",

        "title": "Ageless fitness: Exercise tips for seniors to thrive",
        "body": "If you search for workouts tailored to different age groups on the internet, you will find an astonishing array of over a thousand variations. No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.\n\nWhile ageing is often linked with slowing down, older adults are challenging this stereotype.\n\nFred Oyugi, a personal trainer and CEO of Japesa Fitness and Adventure in Nairobi, says maintaining an active lifestyle is essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. Exercise, he notes, not only enhances physical health but also boosts mental well-being and emotional resilience.\n\nWhether it's taking a leisurely walk in the park or joining a dance class, there are countless ways to stay active and enjoy life to the fullest.\n\n\u201cWhile exercise types remain similar across ages, intensity and approach differ. At 60, gentler workouts are essential compared to the more vigorous routines suitable for 40-year-olds,\" he says.\n\nFor those in their 60s, light strength training and bodyweight exercises are crucial, he advises.\n\nRegardless of age, Fred stresses the importance of rest.\n\n\"Good training is three sessions a week. Rest is also a workout. Rest periods during workouts vary based on age and fitness level. For older women, longer rest periods of one to three minutes between exercises are essential to ensure they can perform the next set effectively without fatigue.\n\nFred notes that physical activity and regular exercise offer a multitude of benefits for seniors. These include increased energy levels, reduced risk or alleviation of chronic diseases, improved quality of sleep, decreased joint pain, stronger bones and muscles, and enhanced brain health and cognitive function.\n\n\u201cThese advantages underscore the importance of staying physically active as we age, promoting overall well-being and a higher quality of life,\u201d he underscores.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a back-squat exercise using the Smith Machine at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nMobility exercises\n\nAccording to the personal trainer, several highly effective mobility exercises tailored for seniors include gentle neck stretches that involve tilting the head left, right, forward, and backwards to alleviate tension in the neck and upper back.\n\nSeated leg lifts performed in a sturdy chair with feet placed flat on the floor help improve hip and thigh mobility by lifting one leg at a time and holding briefly before lowering.\n\nHip rotations, whether standing or sitting and using support as necessary, involve circular motions clockwise and counterclockwise to enhance hip mobility and reduce discomfort in the lower back.\n\nAdditionally, knee extensions done while seated in an upright position with feet flat on the floor strengthen the quadriceps and improve flexibility in the knees. These exercises are beneficial for seniors seeking to maintain or improve their mobility, contributing to overall physical well-being and quality of life.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a leg press at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nMuscle strengthening\n\nFurthermore, Fred highlights the effectiveness of bodyweight workouts for seniors, emphasising their ability to strengthen muscles without relying on external weights.\n\nHe notes that exercises like leg workouts can still be beneficial, acknowledging concerns about knee issues that might limit the use of weighted exercises, such as squats. Instead, focusing on bodyweight leg exercises can provide a safer alternative while still promoting strength and mobility in older adults.\n\n\u201cLeg workouts can be challenging for older persons due to knee issues, particularly when it comes to exercises like squats that involve weights. Older adults often already have knee problems, and performing squats with added weights can potentially exacerbate these issues and lead to injuries.\n\nHowever, leg workouts using just body weight can still be safely incorporated into their exercise routine. This approach allows for strengthening and conditioning the legs without putting undue strain on compromised joints, promoting fitness and mobility while minimising the risk of injury,\u201d he says.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a backstretch at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nOutdoor exercises\n\nThe gym isn't the only arena where his clients thrive; hiking and outdoor activities are integral to his holistic approach to fitness.\n\n\u201cFitness isn't just about the gym; it's about enjoying life and staying active. So what we do is we prepare them for life after retirement. Preparing mentally is as important as preparing physically,\" he stresses.\n\nThrough his guidance, older adults not only build muscle but also fortify their minds against the challenges that come with ageing.\n\nMinding the posture and diet\n\nPosture, another cornerstone of Fred's training, is emphasised to prevent injuries. \"A slight mistake in posture can lead to significant issues,\" he warns, underscoring the importance of proper form in every exercise.\n\nIn terms of diet, he advocates for a balanced approach. \"Exercise and diet go hand in hand,\" he asserts. \"What you eat affects how you perform and recover.\" He encourages his clients to adopt sustainable eating habits that complement their fitness goals.\n\nJapesa Fitness trainer Fred Oyugi performs a backstretch at the gym on June 22, 2024. Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nFitness trend\n\nThe evolution of fitness demographics is evident to Fred. \"Gone are the days when gyms were dominated by the young,\" he observes. \"Nowadays, older adults are taking charge of their health.\" His clientele spans a wide age range, with individuals in their 80s embracing fitness as a lifestyle.\n\nOther workouts include shoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a slow, controlled manner to improve shoulder mobility and reduce stiffness.",

        "title": "Harrison Muiru: \u2018The one question I ask myself as a man in my 40s\u2019",
        "body": "There is a phrase I love in the Star Trek movie franchise, about Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru. It goes like this: It\u2019s a test designed to draw inferences about someone\u2019s character by giving them a no-win scenario and about how you, as a starship captain, face a situation when there are no good options. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do, the simulation will throw the worst possible result at you. There is no cheat code. You can\u2019t win, because the point of the test is to find out how you react to losing.\n\nI imagine life to be a Kobayashi Maru. Your dreams, ambitions, relationships\u2014everything really\u2014you can\u2019t use someone\u2019s template. You wonder, what if I had picked the other road? So you wing it\u2014leadership, fatherhood, manhood\u2014there\u2019s no formula.\n\nHarrison Muiru, the Group Managing Director of Smart Applications International, has navigated his journey this way, seeking discernment but realising ultimately, we are playing with one hand tied behind our backs. He found joy where it matters: in his friends, wife, and three daughters\u2014whom he witnessed getting birthed.\n\n\u201cThat experience changes you,\u201d he says, and I can detect the sunshine in his words\u2014those same words that cast a shadow that further says, ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you win or lose, but if you enjoyed the journey.\n\nBy the way, Captain Kirk was credited with \u201cbeating\u201d the test, not passing it.\n\nWhat\u2019s a smart decision you made that got you where you are today?\n\nI moved from the electronics part of engineering to the computer applications part of it. That was seen as a weaker move, but over time I have seen the convergence of electronics and computerisation. I thank God for the wisdom to make those choices.\n\nWould you consider yourself a computer geek?\n\nIt depends. If you mean someone who likes sci-fi movies and occasionally reads about technology, then yes. But I also look at life wholesomely beyond what technology is, and its impact on society.\n\nNot to be simplistic, but there are two camps, maybe three: Star Wars and Star Trek. What kind of sci-fi are you into?\n\nI found Star Wars too off, it stretched fiction too much. I am more of a Star Trek which I think has the right kind of mix. And the matrix too.\n\nIn The Matrix, Neo is given two choices: the red pill (of truth) and the blue pill (illusions). Have you had such a fork-in-the-road moment?\n\nSeveral times. At some point in my career, I was seconded to head an operation outside Kenya, but I sought a middle ground where I opted to do it temporarily so I could do what I was passionate about here in Kenya.\n\nWas family part of this decision?\n\nA very strong part, and I hold it dear\u2014both my extended and immediate nuclear family. But also the familiarity of the Kenyan context, and what we can do to move our country forward.\n\nWhat\u2019s one aspect of family you hold close to your heart?\n\nMoments of interaction, around things like weddings, dinners, outings, and also sacrifices where people are sick and we come together to support each other. Family is what makes us, and without my parents, wife, and children, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today.\n\nWhat\u2019s a moment you shared with your family that has stayed with you?\n\nThe birth of my three daughters. I saw them coming into this world, and it has been indescribable and transformative. When you are there, you appreciate life in a new way.\n\nAre you one of those strong men who enter the labour room?\n\nYes, I am.\n\nHow does that change you?\n\nAs men, we are very much involved in the provision part of the family and can be quite obscured from it; but it is only at that time that you can know how provision connects to this new life coming into inception, walking into the world to be their own person. Every birth is a miracle, and it makes you appreciate humanity differently.\n\nAfter you became a father, what aspect of your life did you choose to focus more on\u2014or less on?\n\nI chose to be a participatory father. And especially after my firstborn, I realised you can only learn on the job, and I encourage men to be in support groups, whether in church or close family. I take them to school, hear them out in terms of their experiences, and give them advice where required.\n\nHow are you raising your daughters differently from how you were raised?\n\nWe spent a lot of time with my mom\u2014my father was out there earning for the family; he was a reverend in the church. I try to participate in my children\u2019s lives. In the 70s and 90s, it was about working hard, now it is about working smart\u2014leadership, social awareness, communication.\n\nWhat family ritual have you created?\n\nOn Sundays, we go to church together. We have lunch together and spend the afternoon together. When the weather is good, Saturday afternoons are reserved for activities like swimming or visiting family and friends.\n\nYou largely grew up with your mom, and now you are a father of daughters, making you surrounded by women from childhood. How does that affect your sense of manhood?\n\nInteresting, no one has broken it down to me like that. We were three boys and two girls in my family, but I believe as a man you get to appreciate how our ladies think and you get to be more understanding of them. It has made me a stronger person as we are driving toward inclusivity and gender equality\u2014and understanding how to navigate the strengths and weaknesses of said male and female genders.\n\nWhat\u2019s your superpower as a dad?\n\nMaking my children laugh. Dad jokes!\n\nWith all these women surrounding you, what do you do just for yourself?\n\nI have my groups of men, the chama, and the boys and I make space for them. We hang out monthly, and all of us are fathers, what we are going through and our relationships and pursue common projects.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one question you are asking yourself as a man now?\n\nFinding balance in different responsibilities\u2014we have a duty to the family, our society and our nation. Sometimes it can lead to a feeling of suffocation, so how do we manage those expectations while offering support to each other?\n\nHow would you describe your manhood so far? Has it been a burden or a launchpad?\n\nI have gone through different phases, and I have decided to look at life through the lens of learning and continuous improvement. I do not regret being born a man and I continue to strive to be better.\n\nWhich is the easiest hat to wear: father, husband, CEO, or just a man?\n\nHaha! Tough question. But, father. But these children are highly conscious of themselves at an early age, it is challenging and you have to accept to be questioned and be ready to answer those questions. As a father, you don\u2019t want to lose credibility because children learn trust from their parents.\n\nWhat\u2019s your insecurity?\n\nThe fear of the unknown future and not being able to protect or provide for your family.\n\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\nA month or so ago. I was on a mini desert safari, with a camel in Morocco. It was a technology conference that I was attending on behalf of the company.\n\nWas it something you always wanted to try?\n\nI challenged myself to do it, haha! It looked interesting at the moment.\n\nWould you consider yourself a spontaneous person?\n\nNo. I am quite analytical, but it has grown on me that life is for the living, and therefore, when I have these moments, I challenge myself and jump on the opportunities as they come by.\n\nGroup Managing Director of Smart Applications International Harrison Muiru at a past company event. Photo credit: File | Nation Media Group\n\nIf life is for the living, what is something you have been postponing that you are finally getting to do?\n\nI am taking a cruise and skydiving. My daughters love water, I call them aquatic. I am a fire spirit; I avoid water but I have to conquer that fear and take them there.\n\nWhat have you finally come to terms with?\n\nLife is short. It has lessons, and if we take time to block out the noise and observe and listen to people and give them a chance, we find that life is quite abundant, and, in that abundance, life becomes fulfilling. That was my realisation when I got to the fourth floor, and has made me quite intentional about how I live my life and engage with the people around me.\n\nWhat has the 40s given you that the 30s and 20s didn\u2019t?\n\nThey say life begins at 40 hehe! My 20s were excitable, being spontaneous and pushing yourself toward risks. In your 30s you are settling in, getting the foundations for family and career. When you get to 40, you already know this is your compass, and you are grounded in your decisions to be bold and intentional.\n\nWhat would the impressionable Harrison in his 20s, tell the 40-year-old you now?\n\nBe more spontaneous and adventurous, and go for it, whatever it is. But he will also pat the 40-year-old and tell him, you\u2019ve done well.\n\nWhat matters more than you thought it would?\n\nFamily, particularly marriage. I have quite a supportive spouse. In the initial years, you don\u2019t look at it that way, but you realise having a close and supportive family makes you have other achievements in life.\n\nHow do people show you love?\n\nHaha! Is that on or off the record? I would say it is just recognising what someone has done or who they have been to you is more significant than the materiality of the reward. Sometimes we either forget or don\u2019t pay attention.\n\nWhat movies best encapsulate your life now?\n\nThe Avengers. I am in a state of my life where I am in a lot of collaborations where I am either creating, enjoying, or maintaining. The realisation is that no one can do it alone and you need to not only have the right networks and relationships in place but also do your part in said engagements.

        "body": "Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.\n\nA bench of five judges of the apex court presided by Chief Justice Martha Koome also held that Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act do not contradict or prohibit banks and financial institutions and their customers from bargaining and entering into a mutual contract concerning interest rates that will be applied to loan facilities.\n\nHowever, the judges said interest rates on loans are subject to the regulation under Section 44 of the Banking Act, which states that \u201cNo institution shall increase its rate of banking or other charges except with the prior approval of the Minister.\u201d\n\nAccording to the court, while a contract that is mutually agreed by parties might provide the bank with the discretion to alter or vary interest rates on loans, that discretion is not absolute or unlimited.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion on this issue, we find that interest rates on loans and facilities advanced by banks or financial institutions are subject to the regulatory process under Section 44 of the Banking Act,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe court added the approval of the Treasury Cabinet Secretary before increasing interest rates ensures that there is some check and balance or oversight to ensure that consumers of the loan facilities are not exploited and that the rates are reasonable.\n\nThe Banking (Increase of Rate of Banking And other Charges) Regulations, 2006, states that an application for approval of an increase in the rate of banking or other charges under Section 44 of the Act, shall be submitted to the Minister through the Central Bank of Kenya Governor.\n\nOther Supreme Court judges who made the ruling were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, and Njoki Ndung\u2019u.\n\nThe judges were deciding a long-running dispute between Stanbic Bank and Santowels Ltd, a manufacturer of sanitary towels.\n\nThe manufacturer said its relationship with the bank hit the rocks in 2002 when it began having doubts concerning the interest charged by the lender. The company consequently paid its outstanding debt and closed its accounts with the lender the same year.\n\nSantowels later engaged Interest Rates Advisory Centre (IRAC) Ltd to recalculate the interest charged on the Stanbic loans. IRAC found that the bank had overcharged the manufacturer interest amounting to Sh68 million.\n\nThe firm moved to court seeking a refund of the overcharged interest.\n\nThe matter moved to the Supreme Court as parties sought the court\u2019s interpretation of the two sections of the Banking Act.\n\nThe lender argued in the second appeal that there are various court decisions on whether provisions of Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act apply to other bank charges, commissions, and rates but also to interest.\n\nStanbic Bank argued that there is uncertainty in the law as there are several contradicting decisions from the courts, on the question of rate of banking and interest variation and when ministerial consent is required.\n\nStanbic argued that regulations cannot override the provisions of Section 52(1) of the Banking Act, in cases where contractual charges are already in place.\n\nThe section states that \"For the avoidance of doubt, no contravention of the provisions of this Act or the Central Bank of Kenya Act shall affect or invalidate in any way any contractual obligation between an institution and any other person.\"\n\nSantowels, however, argued that the maximum rate that banks were entitled to charge their customers by law and as gazetted by CBK was 16.5 percent per annum on a reducing balance.\n\nThe court ruled that the interest it was charged was above what had been set by the CBK in 1997, hence illegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the primary objective of the Banking Act is to regulate banking business in Kenya.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the overarching reason for interest rate capping and/or regulation is to protect consumers from exploitative rates, to increase access to finance, and make credit affordable,\u201d the judges added.\n\nThe court held that the effect of the repeal of Section 39 of the CBK Act and Section 33B of the Banking Act did not completely liberalise the interest rates that banks and financial institutions can charge.\n\nRather, it meant that regulation through capped interest rates was no longer in force, the court said.\n\nThe government in September 2016 imposed legal caps on lending rates at four percentage points above the Central Bank\u2019s benchmark \u2014 then prevailing at nine percent \u2014 and set the maximum borrowing rate at 13 percent.\n\nThe caps were scrapped in 2019 after they were found unconstitutional by the High Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the regulation through the capping of interest rates simply set the parameters within which banks and financial institutions and their customers can negotiate or interact on the issue of interest rates.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis and finding with respect to Section 44 of the Banking Act, the provision plays a different regulatory role yet complementary to that which capped interest rates played,\u201d said the judges.",

        "title": "Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: An exploration of its potential",
        "body": "Kisspeptins, a family of compounds encoded by the KISS1 gene, have garnered significant interest in the scientific community due to their intriguing potential in various physiological processes. Among these, Kisspeptin-10, a decapeptide derived from the cleavage of the primary kisspeptin precursor, has emerged as a particularly notable molecule.\n\nThis article explores the potential functions and mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10 in biological systems, emphasising its hypothesised influence in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, and tumor suppression.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Structural and biochemical characteristics\n\nKisspeptin-10, consisting of ten amino acids, is the shortest active form of the kisspeptins. Studies suggest that its structure allows it to bind effectively to the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54 (also known as KISS1R).\n\nThis receptor-ligand interaction is crucial for the peptide's biological activity.\n\nResearch indicates that the binding of Kisspeptin-10 to GPR54 may trigger a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways, primarily involving phospholipase C and the subsequent release of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These events may lead to an influence in intracellular calcium levels and the activation of protein kinase C, which are critical for the downstream impacts observed in various tissues.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Reproductive physiology\n\nOne of the most extensively studied potential roles of Kisspeptin-10 is in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might act as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion.\n\nThis, in turn, may influence the secretion of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones are pivotal for regulating gonadal function, including steroid and gametogenesis.\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 might play a critical role in the onset of puberty. It has been theorized that the increased expression of Kisspeptin and its receptor during this developmental stage might be a key trigger for the reactivation of the HPG axis, leading to the maturation of the reproductive system.\n\nMoreover, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to regulate reproductive processes, potentially modulating the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: metabolism\n\nBeyond its reproductive functions, Kisspeptin-10 is also speculated to significantly affect metabolic processes. A growing body of data suggests that kisspeptins might be involved in regulating energy homeostasis.\n\nKisspeptin-10 is expressed in several regions of the brain that are known to be critical for metabolic control, including the hypothalamus. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might influence appetite and food intake by interacting with other neuropeptides and hormones involved in energy balance, such as leptin and insulin.\n\nFurthermore, studies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might play a role in glucose homeostasis. Preliminary research indicates that Kisspeptin-10 might increase insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.\n\nThese properties suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have potential implications for managing metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, although more extensive studies are needed to fully understand these mechanisms.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Tumors\n\nAnother intriguing aspect of Kisspeptin-10 is its potential role in tumor suppression. The KISS1 gene was initially identified as a metastasis suppressor gene in melanoma cells. Subsequent research has indicated that Kisspeptin-10 and its receptor might inhibit the metastatic spread of various cancers, including breast, prostate, and gastric.\n\nIt is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10's anti-tumorigenic properties might be mediated through several mechanisms. For instance, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to cease cell migration and invasion by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that affect the extracellular matrix and facilitate tumor metastasis. Kisspeptin-10 might induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, contributing to its potential anti-cancer potential.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Cardiovascular and neuroprotective research\n\nEmerging data suggests that Kisspeptin-10 might also have protective parts in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the cardiovascular context, Kisspeptin-10 is expressed in the heart and blood vessels and is theorized to influence vascular tone and blood pressure regulation.\n\nStudies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have vasoconstrictive impacts, which might be mediated through its interaction with the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.\n\nIn the nervous system, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to exert neuroprotective impacts. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might protect neurons from excitotoxic damage and oxidative stress, potentially by activating survival pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. These properties might have implications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, although further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Conclusion\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 is a multifaceted peptide with a wide range of potential biological functions. Its possible roles in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, tumor suppression, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection highlight its importance in maintaining organismal homeostasis.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10, many aspects of its functions and implications remain speculative and warrant further investigation. As research continues to uncover the complexities of this peptide, it may pave the way for novel strategies in various fields.\n\nPlease remember that none of the compounds mentioned in this paper have been approved for human or animal consumption.\n\nReferences\n\n[i] Navarro VM.

When you go to the schools, there are no infrastructures.\"\n\nAnger spreading\n\nTurmoil is spreading. In Nigeria, workers protesting rising fuel and food costs caused a nationwide power outage, and leaders face rising subsidy costs despite tripling petrol prices last year.\n\nAngola is also trying to cut subsidies, while Egypt is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a slew of spending cuts and reforms that could cause more pain for citizens reeling from record-high inflation above 30 percent.\n\nRisk intelligence firm Verisk Maplecroft warned that more subsidy cuts or tax hikes could serve as a trigger for unrest.\n\nArgentina was roiled by huge general strikes in May against painful austerity measures and planned reforms by libertarian President Javier Milei, whose cost-cutting drive cheered investors but hammered the real economy.\n\nRising borrowing costs mean debt service gobbles a growing chunk of revenues. This puts pressure on countries, including Kenya, to raise taxes and cut spending.\n\nIn 2023, a record 54 developing countries, equivalent to 38 percent of the total, allocated 10 percent or more of government revenues to interest payments, with nearly half of them in Africa, according to a report from UN Trade and Development agency UNCTAD.\n\nMultilateral banks and political risk firms have warned of a ticking time bomb for some time.\n\nWhile debt relief efforts had centred on the poorest nations with solvency problems, and rightly so according to the World Bank, not enough had been done for lower middle-income countries facing temporary liquidity pressures in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without action, 2024 will see a further rise in debt vulnerability \u2014 potentially leading to reversals in development outcomes,\" World Bank senior managing director Axel van Trotsenburg warned.\n\nRising pain\n\nKenya, like others, borrowed heavily in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were low -- and China was splashing cash via its Belt and Road initiative to lend to emerging markets worldwide.\n\nOver the past 20 years Kenya amassed some $82 billion of debt to build roads, railways and factories.\n\nBut not all ambitious projects were completed, and many Kenyans felt they had not benefited, while a slew of corruption scandals spurred allegations that elites enriched themselves.\n\n\"There is no cut on corruption,\" Boniface Mwangi, a prominent social justice activist in Kenya told Reuters. \"We have no problem paying debt, but...what did you do with that money that you borrowed?\"\n\nRuto has said he is waging a war on corruption and has called for those responsible for graft to be prosecuted.\n\nKenya managed to avoid default by issuing more debt earlier this year - but at a punishing interest rate above 10 percent. After this week's protest, the country's bond prices slid again.\n\nRead: Ethiopia defaults on Eurobond repayment\n\nTo keep crucial IMF cash coming, Ruto must find a way to balance the books.\n\n\"Kenya's government has a budget, and cash is not endless - so they need to prioritise,\" said Lutz Roehmeyer at Capitulum Asset Management.\n\nThe IMF, which warned Kenya to reverse \"fiscal slippage\", did not comment on whether it was asking for too much, but said in a statement that it was \"closely monitoring the situation.\"\n\nFor Ruto -- and other leaders struggling to tame debt -- the path forward is far less clear after this week.",

        "title": "Unveiling the secrets of gold trading for beginners",
        "body": "Throughout history, gold trading has solidified as a pillar of investment methods, providing a stable haven within the turbulence of unpredictable economic conditions.\n\nEntering the world of gold trading might seem intimidating to novices at first, but with a firm understanding of its fundamentals, one can embark on this rewarding journey with confidence.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on the mysterious world of gold trading, this article provides traders who are new to the game with helpful advice and methods.\n\nUnderstanding the basics of gold trading\n\nBuying and selling gold with the intention of making a profit is the core of the art of gold trading. In contrast to long-term gold storage under your mattress, trading is all about riding the waves of momentary price fluctuations.\n\nThere are several methods to become involved in this vibrant market: you may invest in gold futures, horde real gold like a pirate with coins and bars, ride along on gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), or even mine stocks.\n\nEvery route has its own set of hazards and tricks, so it pays to be aware of the terrain and choose your poison carefully depending on what makes your heart race and how much danger you can take.\n\nTechnical analysis: The foundation of gold trading\n\nIn gold trading, technical analysis is similar to detective work. It entails closely examining price charts to look for hints about potential future moves. These include determining trend lines, head and shoulders or double top patterns, and support and resistance levels.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and moving averages are examples of indicators that may be used as research instruments to provide information about possible price movements and market sentiment.\n\nGaining proficiency in technical analysis enables traders to accurately interpret market signals and make well-informed judgments for successful trading strategies.\n\nThe role of fundamental analysis\n\nWhen it comes to gold trading, fundamental research is akin to penetrating the rich past concealed below the glossy exterior.\n\nFinding the economic statistics, central bank policies, and international political dramas that drive up gold prices is the key. For example, be prepared for a stronger dollar and a possible decline in gold prices when the Fed suggests rising interest rates.\n\nThis is because gold loses value when other currencies gain value. Traders may anticipate changes in the market and adjust their strategies to optimize their earnings by analyzing these intricately linked narratives.\n\nDeveloping a trading strategy\n\nThe secret to being an expert in gold trading is developing a solid trading plan. It's similar to planning a route: decide on the appropriate vehicle (trading instruments), pack for your comfort level (risk tolerance), and know where you're going (defined goals).\n\nManaging risk is your compass, whether you're swinging slowly for a few days or running through the day. Put stop-loss orders in place to avoid risk and profit as soon as your goal comes into view. Adhere to your strategy religiously, and you will witness the glittering success of your trading career.\n\nUtilising trading platforms and tools\n\nFor astute traders, modern trading platforms are a veritable treasure of tools and resources. Imagine having access to technical analysis tools, news feeds, and real-time price charts at your fingertips.\n\nDemo accounts are similar to a practice run; they are ideal for novices to see the waters without jumping in too deep. Additionally, you may trade anytime, anywhere with mobile trading apps, which function like a portable trading desk. When you have these tools at your disposal, you're dealing wisely rather than merely for gold.\n\nPsychological aspects of trading\n\nManaging your emotions is just as important to success in the gold market as analyzing data. Imagine this: The fluctuations in the market have the power to arouse greed and anxiety more quickly than a rollercoaster.\n\nYou need a well-thought-out plan and a disciplined approach to stay consistent. Consider it as your mental fitness regimen, similar to preparing for a marathon: mindfulness and stress reduction. By maintaining your composure, you're learning the skill of emotional intelligence in trading, not only trading gold.\n\nLegal and regulatory considerations\n\nKeeping your capital secure and healthy is just as important as avoiding errors while navigating the legal environment of gold dealing. Consider it like being aware of the traffic laws prior to embarking on an exciting journey.\n\nA plethora of bureaucracy exists in regulations, ranging from taxation and reporting to trading limitations and all in between. Remain educated and, when in doubt, get advice. By abiding by the regulations, you not only safeguard your nest egg but also contribute to the proper operation of the financial system.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nStarting a gold trading business is similar to going on a treasure hunt: it's thrilling and may be quite profitable.\n\nYou'll be able to confidently negotiate the ups and downs of the gold market by grasping the fundamentals, fusing technical expertise with fundamental understanding, and developing a solid trading strategy.\n\nIt's important to maintain composure while emotions are running high in addition to crunching data.",

        "body": "Days before the gloom - the water cannons, and the young protesters shot in the head - Ann Kinuthia-Otieno, Chief Executive of Airtel Money walks onto the rooftop of Emara Ole Sereni in Nairobi. A petite lady, you can immediately tell she\u2019s (to use an apt analogy of the moment) a bullet; straight-shooting, driven, and determined.\n\nShe left Absa Bank as a head of products to run Airtel\u2019s mobile business after it split from Airtel Networks a few years ago to operate as a standalone business. And she comes at a tough time to do business\u2014hell, tough time to just be alive\u2014as a challenger brand. Even more daunting is that she faces a herculean task in the form of mobile money dominance.\n\nNonetheless, not one to complain, Ann\u2019s been working her hide off. Over time, she has tripled the daily transaction limits and significantly reduced its pay bill, bulk payments, and wallet-to-bank charges. The subscribers of Airtel Mobile Money have gone up.\n\n\u201cToday people don\u2019t think much about Airtel Money, but one day they will.\u201d She promises. \u201cWe have covered good ground but the runaway is still long.\u201d\n\n[Earlier, we were discussing parenting before the interview officially commenced.]\n\nYou never know immediately the impact of your parenting until much later...\n\nThere is something growing up that influenced the person that you are today. And these things can either be taken positively or not. Generally, you never know, as a parent, if your decisions were the right ones...\n\nUntil the end\u2026\n\nUntil the end. But again, I think there are cues that sometimes we don't take in or choose to ignore. So, for instance, I was in boarding school with my sister with whom I shared a birthday, the same month, same date, but we are two years apart. She's my elder. We were in State House Girls High School and my parents, for some reason, used to visit us and bring things in odd numbers for us to share. It was frustrating because if you bring seven items, someone will get less. But they let us figure it out ourselves. What that taught us is about sharing, being fair. But it didn\u2019t come easy because you know how siblings can get. When I think about where my sense of fairness came from, it's from there.\n\nWhat do you find harder; parenting or leadership?\n\nParenting. With children you have the pressure of creating a legacy, an impact that has implications on generations to come. It\u2019s a big responsibility. The corporate world is different in that if I leave this job tomorrow, nobody will care about me. There will be someone else doing my job. With your children, it\u2019s a different ball game because everything matters and it will shape their future.\n\nWhat are you struggling with today?\n\nMy struggle today is Airtel Money. It\u2019s a challenger brand that I need to grow. My late dad taught me a very important lesson that has stayed with me: whatever it is that you do, give it your very best so that nobody can come and do it after you. The sense of perfectionism comes from him.\n\nGrowing the brand is difficult, especially in a market where there's a dominant player and so that keeps me awake at night, thinking about what we can do to create impact and make a difference. I\u2019ve been in the role for two years and every day I wake up to ask if I have made a difference. We have grown our customer base six times since I joined. It's been blood, sweat, and tears with the team.\n\nWhat have you done lately that you were very proud of?\n\nProfessionally? The interoperability made possible with the help of the regulator, after five years, has enabled our customers to pay their bills online through the competitor\u2019s paybill number.\n\nOn a more personal front, just the impact on my younger children\u2019s lives - they are 10 and 12. Last year we had a bet with my two girls and I told them if they win academic awards, I would buy them a dog. And I don\u2019t like dogs at all. I think they are good to look at from afar. Anyway, they both got academic awards. So we had to get a dog and it's growing on me. It's a golden retriever - very playful, very friendly. It\u2019s destroying my flowers and I love gardening. It\u2019s taught my girls more responsibility even though they cook for themselves and stuff. This morning the dog messed up my flowers again and one of them she said,\"Maybe we can train the dog that it's not supposed to eat flowers\". I told her, \"You figure it out, it\u2019s your dog\".\n\nAre you living your life the way you want to?\n\nI pray so, yeah, because you don't have two chances. And losing both my parents taught me that - even though they lived to their 70s - life is short. The key is to create an impact on my family and my job. My dad was very disciplined; everday, five in the morning, he was in the office. He had such a high level of integrity. He used to tell us, \"You should be like Caesar's wife; above reproach\". He was very passionate and I think I take after him.\n\nI tend to be like a dog with a bone. I just go and refuse to give up. My boss says I'm like a woodpecker [Chuckles]. My mom was a teacher and after she retired, she started her school. She was hardworking and very friendly and extroverted. I got my father\u2019s genes. I look like him as well. He died of cancer after fighting it for seven years. He used to tell us, \"If you choose any cancer, have leukaemia. He had MCL (mantle cell lymphoma). Mom's symptoms started showing three months before she died. They died three years apart.\n\nAre you scared of cancer seeing as they both died of it?\n\nYeah, I mean, we all are, but you can't live life being scared. We all have to exit. The key thing is, what are you doing with the time that you have? What impact are you creating? Because at the end of the day, I believe God is just going to ask you, \"What have you done with the life that I've given you?\" My mom knew she had six months to live but she lived her life fully until the last day. So one has to live their life.\n\nDo you see yourself in your 60s, which is traditionally when people slow down and retire?\n\nI don\u2019t think I will retire. I plan to keep my mind engaged. I worked in the banking sector for two decades and looked at corporate deals across Africa because I worked in South Africa for two years and then came back and looked after SMEs and then moved to retail. That\u2019s a lot of learning and experience which I intend to use in consulting in my 60s. Maybe also sit on boards. I also love making social impact. God has given me so much and I shouldn't wait to be 60 to give back. It\u2019s something I\u2019m continually doing now outside work.\n\nWhat do you do outside work, outside family?\n\nChurch. I\u2019m passionate about making a difference. I got to the International Christian Centre. I was a deacon there at some point. Now my husband is a deacon. I also sit on a board at Pangani Girls. I head the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nWhen did you start serving the Lord?\n\nWhen I was in Form two. I used to have these recurring dreams where the world was ending and I'd be rushing to church, only to be told it's too late. One evening, I felt a very strong sense of presence, and I knew it couldn't be ordinary. Nobody talked to me. Nobody. You know, the way people now say they were led to Christ and stuff like that. No. For me, it was just at that moment\u2019s decision. I interpreted my dreams as a bigger calling that I heeded. Since then God has been a central part of my life. My leadership journey has been shaped by bibilical teachings. I constantly go back and read the Bible for encouragement in every sphere of my life.\n\nWhich is harder, leading people in church or at the workplace?\n\n[Chuckles] Being a deacon is like being a board member. It\u2019s an oversight role. People come to church to receive encouragement while in the office people\u2019s job is to create returns for the shareholder. People in church are more forgiving and they will take you in stride. The corporate world is more challenging, and that's why you go to church, right? To get more encouragement. [Chuckles]\n\nAnn Kinuthia-Otieno, Airtel Money CEO at a past company event. Photo credit: Francis Nderitu | Nation Media Group\n\nDid you meet Mr Otieno in church?\n\nNo, I met him when I was a corporate manager at Barclays, now Absa. So he's a financial consultant and there was a deal that he was doing and I was a corporate credit analyst. He's the deacon in the church, responsible for the finance docket.\n\nWhat did you learn about his people that surprised someone like you who comes from a different tribe?\n\n[Laughs] The unity of their family. Us Kikuyus can be individualistic sometimes. I think capitalism is very strong in Kikuyuland. I was surprised at the sense of unity in their village in Rongo, Migori. People just come to your home and are welcomed, people stay with each other\u2026I found that very refreshing.\n\nWhat's your extravagance?",

        "title": "Trific CEO Brenda Mbathi unveils investment plan after Two Rivers SEZ licence",
        "body": "In June 2023, listed investment firm Centum received a special economic zone (SEZ) licence covering 64 of the 106 acres of its Two Rivers development in Nairobi.\n\nA year down the road, the firm has announced a Sh6.1 billion funding package for the SEZ, which is known as the Two Rivers International Finance and Innovation Centre (Trific), from Africa-focused fund manager Vantage Capital.\n\nTrific chief executive Brenda Mbathi spoke to the Business Daily on the company\u2019s investment plan for the centre with the new capital injection, and the uptake of space at the facility over the past year.\n\nHow do you intend to deploy the new investment?\n\nOut of the investment from Vantage Capital, Sh2 billion will be allocated for acquiring and fitting out the Trific North Tower. This 14,975 square metre property will serve as a cornerstone of our SEZ.\n\nThe remaining Sh4 billion will be used to develop an additional office tower offering 76,800 square metres of leasable space. This development will provide the necessary infrastructure to support the influx of SEZ enterprises and ensure we meet the demand for high-quality office space.\n\nThe design and functionality of the new tower will reflect our commitment to creating a world-class business environment, setting a new benchmark for commercial properties in the region.\n\nWhat are the terms of the funding? Is it debt or equity investment?\n\nThe funding from Vantage Capital is structured as a mezzanine finance investment. This type of funding combines elements of both debt and equity, providing us with the capital required while being less dilutive to our shareholders than pure equity. It allows us to maintain a balanced financial structure, ensuring both stability and growth potential for Trific SEZ.\n\nMezzanine financing is particularly advantageous as it offers flexible terms and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the project. This flexibility is crucial for large-scale developments like Trific SEZ, where capital requirements vary significantly.\n\nBy utilising this kind of finance, we can optimise our capital structure, manage risks more effectively, and ensure the sustainability of our growth plans.\n\nHow many enterprises or organisations have signed up to the EPZ and what are their business focus area?\n\nTo date, 14 SEZ enterprises have signed up and secured space in the Trific North Tower. These enterprises operate across various sectors, including business processing outsourcing (BPO), shared services centres, regional headquarters, and investment holding corporations. Collectively, these enterprises are expected to create approximately 10,000 jobs and attract foreign direct investment amounting to about $65 million. The space is currently 70 percent committed by these enterprises in the Trific North Tower.\n\nWhat is your strategy for the SEZ now that you have the new funding?\n\nThe strategy is to leverage the new funding to enhance and expand our infrastructure, creating a more attractive and efficient environment for businesses.\n\nOur strategic location within Nairobi\u2019s prestigious diplomatic blue zone provides access to key markets and international business hubs. The SEZ framework in Kenya also offers various strategic incentives, including fiscal tax incentives, which are critical in reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability for businesses operating within Trific SEZ.\n\nTrific SEZ, therefore, offers an ecosystem designed to provide businesses with a competitive edge. This includes world-class infrastructure, advanced technology, and a regulatory framework conducive to business growth.\n\nBy fostering an integrated live-work-play ecosystem, we aim to attract a diverse range of businesses and talent, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to thrive.\n\nThe Kenya Finance Bill 2024 has proposed to exempt property transfers within an SEZ from capital gains tax. What would be the impact of such an exemption on the competitiveness of Kenyan SEZs?\n\nThe exemption from capital gains tax on property transfers within an SEZ that was proposed in the Finance Act was essentially a clarification, as capital gains tax exemption is already allowed within the SEZ Act and it is a significant financial benefit for special economic zones.\n\nThis exemption creates a more attractive investment environment for current and potential SEZ enterprises. By reducing the financial barriers associated with property transfers, we can facilitate smoother and more efficient transactions, encouraging more businesses to establish and expand their operations within the SEZ space.\n\nThis financial flexibility is crucial in maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring the long-term success of SEZs in Kenya.",

        "body": "Kenya\u2019s financially distressed companies are grappling to secure a lifeline through \u2018administration\u2019 owing to their debts and late implementation of recovery measures, which pushed them into liquidation.\n\nAn administration process involves appointing an administrator to run a distressed company for one year with a possibility of extension by the court or selling it as a going concern to enhance its value for the benefit of its creditors.\n\nPlacing a firm under administration helps to regain control when it has serious cash flow problems, is insolvent, and faces threats from creditors. This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.\n\nData by the Office of the Official Receiver shows petitions for company liquidations are on the rise and have hit 30 since July 2023, highlighting the extent of financial distress facing businesses due to economic downturn and governance-related issues.\n\nAdministrators say keeping distressed companies as a going concern is becoming difficult because of debts that cannot be repaid within the \u2018administration period\u2019 of up to 18 months, citing the collapsed retail chain Nakumatt that went under with an estimated Sh38 billion worth of claims.\n\nLiquidation (or winding up) is the process by which a company\u2019s existence is terminated by selling its assets to pay off its debts. Any money remaining after all debts, expenses, and costs have been paid off is distributed among the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nSince the introduction of the administration process in 2015, Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, ARM Cement Plc. and Deacons Plc were the first to go through the process, with hopes that their recovery would set a positive trend for other companies likely to undergo the same process.\n\nHowever, these companies failed to survive the administration process, paving the way for their liquidation.\n\n\u201cThese companies are heavily indebted. They can\u2019t come out of that big hole. So, what we have been doing is trying to sell those assets to somebody who can buy them and put them to use because you find that by the time the company has gone that route, it can take them long to recover. I give an example of Nakumatt with Sh38 billion debt, which you can\u2019t expect to recover. No bank will give you more money to pay that,\u201d says Peter Kahi, a partner at PKF Consulting (K) Ltd.\n\n\u201cSo we look at options. The first option is to see whether we can rescue that company, the second option is to try and maximise the returns for all creditors so that at least they get something, and if you can\u2019t achieve the third option is to sell the assets to pay for preferential creditors and other claims. Most administrators have been going for option two or option three.\u201d\n\nThe number of petitions for liquidation of companies presented to court has more than doubled in the last nine years. Even after the new Insolvency Act (2015) introduced a provision for an \u2018administration process\u2019 to give a chance to financially troubled firms to put their houses in order and revert to the recovery path.\n\nPetitions for liquidations by the court rose to 30 in the 2023-24 fiscal year (July-June) from 13 petitions in the 2015-16 fiscal year (July-June), while the number of companies pushed into voluntary liquidation increased to nine from five in the same period.\n\nAbout 22 companies were put under liquidation through direct appointment in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Office of the Official Receiver.\n\n\u201cI can say these companies don\u2019t go into liquidation but somebody else comes to make better use of their assets because if you continue running that company how many years will it take you to pay off Sh38 billion debt because the administrators\u2019 period is 12 months with the first extension of maybe six months and that is what the law says,\u201d says Mr Kahi.\n\nKen Gichinga, a Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says recovery of companies under administration requires a combination of administration and managerial expertise to be able tackle deal with problems related to the weak macroeconomic environment and the \u2018trust deficit\u2019 reputation crisis occasioned by the \u2018receivership\u2019 tag.\n\n\u201cCompanies in receivership have to fight two battles which are a weak economic environment and the trust deficit battle associated with the high risk profile of companies in receivership. So you will find that the appointed administrators of these companies (in administration) end up fighting two battles instead of one battle and that is the reason it has been that hard to revive these companies,\u201d says Mr Gichinga.\n\n\u201c From the word \u2018administrator, the administrators\u2019 main concern is to keep the companies in administration as a \u2018going concern\u2019 but what these companies really need is almost a double level of management trend to be able to navigate this weak macroeconomic environment and to win the confidence of the customers. What we need is administrators working together with management gurus to revive these companies.\u201d\n\nAdministrators say that normally they are called upon when companies are in the \u2018intensive Care Unit (ICU)\u2019 with nothing to salvage as most assets have been stripped by the directors. These companies are going through a crisis in which they cannot meet their debt obligations, salaries are in arrears, auctioneers are calling at the doors of the company, the tax man is calling and critical supplies such as electricity have been disconnected.\n\n\u201cThere are three objectives of any administration. Reviving a company is the first and depends to a large extent on the state of the company at the point of the intervention,\u201d George Weru, a Business Recovery Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said in an earlier interview.\n\n\u201cIf the intervention is too late when the distress is very significant this is not practical. The administrator proceeds to the next objective which is to sell the business as a going concern. This ensures continuity of the business and saves jobs which to me is still a success.\u201d\n\nUnder the Insolvency law, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it fails to pay a debt of Sh100, 000 or more after 21 days of a written demand being served upon it.\n\nAccording to a law firm Maina & Onsare Partners Advocates LLP the process of administration is intended to offer breathing space for insolvent companies while availing better returns and packages for creditors which are not ordinarily available in liquidation.\n\n\u201cIt also gives Companies going through financial turmoil an opportunity to put their acts together. This allows them to continue operating instead of the earlier practice of abruptly killing them as was the case in the previous statutes (now repealed),\u201d the law firm says on its website.\n\n\u201cIt is an alternative rescue process which leads to a stay of past and future legal proceedings as envisaged by Section 560 & 561 of the Insolvency Act hence making it cheaper for the company.\u201d\n\nUp until 2015, a company in financial distress was met often with the liquidation culture triggered by voluntarily or by a creditor or subject to the court's supervision.",

That spurred the government, in the 2024/25 Budget, to outline a raft of tax increases in a bid to get its fiscal consolidation plans back on track.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury data shows taxes grew at a slower rate of 10.83 percent year-on-year to Sh1.93 trillion than that in non-debt recurrent expenditure in the 11 months ended May.\n\nThe Ruto administration\u2019s plan to make up for slower growth in taxes than expenditure through Finance Bill 2024 was this week thwarted by youth-led demonstrators who poured onto the streets of cities and major towns countrywide saying additional taxes will exacerbate an already unbearable cost of living.\n\nDr Ruto was banking on the new taxes which targeted Sh346 billion in new revenue and expenditure cuts largely targeting non-essential expenditures such as hospitality and renovation of offices as well as slashing allocations for Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies to place the country on the path to a balanced budget by year 2027.\n\nAnalysts have, however, insisted that Kenya has an \u201cexpenditure problem and not a tax problem\u201d, indicating that the government needs to tame its spend further to achieve a balanced budget where borrowing is kept at minimal levels.\n\nInternational Budget Partnership's Country Manager for Kenya Abraham Rugo has cited supplementary budgets to cater for expenses that were not initially budgeted as the main driver of non-debt expenditures.\n\n\u201cGovernments are meant to exist and deliver services perpetuity which means that as the size of government grows, recurrent expenditures are likely to increase indefinitely,\u201d Dr Rugo said.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not mean that there are no wastages or inefficiencies in the public sector that drive a wedge between productivity and compensation (wages).\u201d\n\nState House, which has been undergoing a major renovation this financial year, has been the largest beneficiary of mini-budgets. Treasury data shows expenditure at the State House had exceeded the original full-year budget by about half (49.20 percent) in the 11-month through May to Sh9.5 billion.",

I say this because there is a feeling you get when you walk in there, through all those shelves upon shelves of bottles of wine. It\u2019s like walking through an aquarium of alcohol.\n\nYou feel giddy with anticipation even if you don\u2019t care too much about wine. Maybe this feeling is further complemented by the usage of wood. And lighting. It\u2019s all in the simplicity and the flow. Anyhow, whatever it is, a beer to the interior stylist.\n\nI recently sat with a friend in one of those raised tables inside, the one facing the short bar and the back entrance. Cosy little corner, too cosy to be wasted discussing politics. My friend is a typical middle-class who has never teared up from teargas but complains about the state of our governance. She also feels like going to protest is too \u201cdangerous.\u201d That tear gas might get into her hair. (Great hair, I will admit).\n\nThis is a malady that has afflicted us and our parents; taking it on the chin, turning the other cheek. It was my first ever protest and after that, I was calling out all my friends who think protests are for \u201cother people.\u201d I realise that I was quite insufferable.\n\nAnyway, Wine Bar (no fault of theirs) felt like the kind of place people who have never sniffed teargas would gather to talk about teargas and violence. It\u2019s safe and cosy and gorgeous. The staff/sommeliers are friendly and helpful and if you love wine and you have the ambition to go to heaven then you will wonder if that\u2019s not heaven already.",

Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.\n\nNow the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as \u201can act of arson\u201d.\n\nNearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.\n\nMany of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.\n\nBut more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jules Ehrhardt says \u2018collective centuries of institutional knowledge\u2019 have been lost. Photograph: Jesse Grant/Getty Images\n\nJules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was \u201coutrage and disbelief in the British business community\u201d at the decision.\n\n\u201cThey are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,\u201d he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.\n\nHe said the consulate directors had \u201cserved as the connective tissue\u201d between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. \u201cWe shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain\u2019s \u2018gateway to Europe\u2019 status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we\u2019ve self-elected a lobotomy,\u201d Ehrhardt said.\n\n\u201cThis [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.\u201d\n\nAllan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were \u201cabsolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey plug companies into a market they otherwise don\u2019t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US \u2018doing business\u2019 culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.\n\n\u201cMore than a million Brits are employed by American businesses \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It\u2019s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an \u201cAtlantic declaration\u201d with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.\n\nState-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.\u201d",

        "body": "Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.\n\nThe Horticultural Trade Association, which represents 1,400 garden retailers and growers in the UK, has joined forces with several European trade bodies to write an open letter to call for urgent solutions, warning the new system was adding more than 25% to import costs.\n\nIt said the checks introduced in April had held up a significant number of deliveries at the border, sometimes for as long as 44 hours, while difficulties carrying out inspections were increasing the chance of harmful pests and plant diseases entering Britain.\n\nThe new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports. Previously, plants were inspected in spot checks once they had reached nurseries.\n\nThe trade bodies said the new system is causing delays and piling on costs. One haulage company said it experienced 93 hours of driver waiting time in the first week of the checks, costing it \u00a338,000 in extra pay.\n\nThe company calculated that this would add \u00a31.5m to its logistics bill over the next year, an increase of 25%.\n\nAnother company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem. This resulted in the majority of plants dying or wilting and the loads being rejected by the end customer.\n\nThe letter was signed by International Flower Trade Association, whose membership accounts for 80% of the total value of worldwide trade of flowers and pot plants, as well as VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products.\n\nIt comes as importers are already having to deal with increased costs on moving plant and animal products to Britain because companies are now charged for inspections of goods at the border.\n\nThe letter said in some cases providers could be paying \u00a31,740 extra to bring in a mixed load of 12 different consignments of plants, making trade unviable for many small businesses.\n\nUnder the new Brexit rules, plants for planting have been categorised as high-risk, meaning much higher rates of inspection than for businesses that import meat and dairy, which are classified as medium risk.\n\nImporters claim the posts are too small to process goods from multiple lorries, and they said there is insufficient equipment at nearly all facilities to unload plants such as large trees or those large plants not stacked into plant trolleys.\n\nBefore the checks came in April, imported plants were held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before checks on site by government inspectors.\n\nUnder the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts. The government has insisted that this would enhance the country\u2019s biosecurity by stopping harmful diseases entering the country and damaging plants and crops.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The letter said: \u201cOlive trees are a well-known host for Xylella fastidiosa, a very high-risk and damaging bacterial disease.\n\n\u201cThe end customer would have expected and paid for the at-border check \u2026 Yet the business received no information about what had happened and why, nor was it aware that those trees had an incomplete check.\u201d\n\nThe government said it was working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly, while also publishing guidance on how to reduce delays for companies.\n\nIt added that checks were handled by fully trained staff to standard operating procedures ensuring inspections were undertaken safely.\n\nThe other signatories to the letter were the European Nurserystock Association, Royal Anthos (the Dutch Association for Nursery Stock and Flower Bulbs), VBN (the Dutch Flower Auctions Association) and Transport en Logistiek Nederland (the Dutch Transport & Logistics Association).",

        "body": "Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.\n\nBut this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.\n\nMeanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain\u2019s tarmac.\n\nSo what might the election resolve \u2013 and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?\n\nThe culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2\n\nOne of Keir Starmer\u2019s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour \u201cthe only party on the side of drivers\u201d \u2013 a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for \u201cpeople\u2019s freedom to use their cars\u201d.\n\nThe Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.\n\nNow the party\u2019s manifesto highlights its \u201cbacking drivers bill\u201d in a chapter dedicated to \u201cstrengthening our communities\u201d, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) \u2013 an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government\u2019s own part in setting it up.\n\nThe rhetoric of ending a \u201cwar on motorists\u201d is shared in Reform UK\u2019s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.\n\nCampaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: \u201cWe\u2019re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist \u2013 we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.\u201d\n\nAnother headline Conservative promise is to \u201cstop road pricing\u201d, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer\u2019s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts \u2013 including motoring organisations \u2013 believe some such scheme eventually must come.\n\nBeyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform\u2019s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another \u00a325bn.\n\nAny mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour\u2019s manifesto, while the Conservatives\u2019 reiterates the derided \u201cNetwork North\u201d mixture of schemes funded by a putative \u00a336bn saving from axing HS2\u2019s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Liberal Democrat manifesto is the only one to propose reviving scrapped sections of the HS2 plans. Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nThe post-election action areas: rail reform \u2013 and potholes\n\nDespite the fate of the UK\u2019s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss J\u00fcrgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.\n\nBut the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour\u2019s manifesto puts it, \u201cthe potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule\u201d. The Tories have already earmarked \u00a38bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra \u00a365m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.\n\nA bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising \u201cthe biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties \u2013 partial renationalisation of rail \u2013 has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.\n\nWhoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway\u2019s structure and fares is promised. The \u201cguiding mind\u201d will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 \u2013 the worst performance in 19 years.\n\nA critical task will be to end the disruption from rail\u2019s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to \u201cend chaos\u201d suggests a possible reset.\n\nOff limits: road pricing and curbing flying\n\nThe vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about \u00a327bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.\n\n\u201cRoad pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,\u201d says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. \u201cPeople think \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up\u2019.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Campaign for Better Transport advocates a charge of 2p a km for electric cars. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy\n\nBarrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: \u201cThe dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car \u2013 but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?\u201d\n\nBut, he says: \u201cI would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn\u2019t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.\n\nTackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.",

        "body": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951.\n\nThe Guardian understands that a letter sent on Sunday afternoon by Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, has offered a new round of discussions about future investments at the company\u2019s plants in the UK, including Port Talbot.\n\nHowever, sources have said the offer to the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which represents all three unions at the site in south Wales, is predicated on unions agreeing to suspend any future industrial action.\n\nTata had originally planned to close the second of its two remaining blast furnaces at the end of September, while the process of shutting down the first is due to begin in the middle of this week. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.\n\nThe plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not \u201csafely and stably\u201d operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday 7 July.\n\nThe new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then. The Guardian understands the talks being offered would focus on future investments.\n\nCommenting on the letter, Alun Davies, national officer for Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said there were no fresh talks being proposed, and it simply reaffirmed Tata\u2019s position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting in May.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis position is that all unions will seek to conclude the negotiations on a memorandum of understanding and then put this to their members to decide whether it\u2019s good enough.\u201d\n\nHe added that the letter from Tata confirmed that all discussions would take place through the UK Steel Committee, which is chaired by Community\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss.\n\nUnite warned over the weekend that any closure would be \u201cirreversible\u201d and urged Tata not to \u201cabandon\u201d the workers employed at the plant.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe again call on the company to wait until we have a change of government, not make any irreversible decisions, and enter into meaningful negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was reportedly in talks with the unions and Tata last week in an effort to avert the early closure.\n\nThe first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, and the Welsh economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, said: \u201cThe news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces 4 and 5 at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community.\n\n\u201cThe Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Tata struck a controversial deal with the UK government, securing a \u00a3500m grant to build a greener \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace. However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.\n\nThe Labour party, widely expected to win a majority in Thursday\u2019s general election, has previously promised to invest \u00a33bn in the UK\u2019s steel industry in the next parliament, if elected. This would include the \u00a3500m already pledged to Port Talbot.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they are successful, Unite will reballot. We cannot allow these steel jobs to go.\u201d\n\nTata has previously said it is losing about \u00a31m each day keeping the remaining furnaces open.\n\nA Tata spokesperson said: \u201cIn the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site.\n\n\u201cThat is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\u201d",

        "body": "The road haulage industry is calling on the new government to urgently tackle investment in infrastructure for electric trucks, after pointing out there is just one public charging point for HGVs in the whole of the UK.\n\nTakeup of electric cars is soaring, with about 1.1m fully battery-powered cars on British roads and about 63,000 charging units in 33,000 locations, according to Zapmap data.\n\nBut the haulage industry is miles behind, with just 300 electric HGVs registered out of the country\u2019s 500,000-strong lorry fleet, says the Road Haulage Association (RHA).\n\nAfter surveying the country, the RHA found only one public charging point at which lorries can power up. It is located at a service station at Rivington, on the M61 southbound about halfway between Manchester and Preston.\n\nChris Ashley, policy lead on environment and vehicles at the RHA, said action was needed. He said: \u201cAll the anxieties people have with cars, whether it\u2019s raining, whether the windscreen wipers or air conditioning are running, applies to trucks. It depends on the weather and the load.\n\n\u201cOn average, a good range for a diesel truck would be 600 miles, with caveats of course. That is why a public charging network is necessary, in our view,\u201d he said.\n\nResearch shows 70% of British electric trucks return to depots for recharging overnight, according to the RHA. Longer-haul journeys are impossible on batteries, which means most electric trucks are used for local deliveries within a 50- to 80-mile radius.\n\nThe size and weight of trucks means the distance they can achieve on a battery is a fraction of a car, just 200 miles.\n\nThe RHA is planning to submit 12 demands to the new government, with polls predicting a Labour win in this week\u2019s election.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.\n\n\u201cMy friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.\u201d\n\nVanessa\u2019s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the \u201cplummeting mental health of young people\u201d, she says. \u201cPut these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.\u201d\n\nHer decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.\n\nThese factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\n\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.\n\nHere we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.\n\nHow the UK is affected\n\nThe total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAs a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the \u201creplacement rate\u201d, often known as the \u201cR-rate\u201d, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.\n\nIt has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.\n\nAnn Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: \u201cThe Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.\u201d\n\nThe trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.\n\nThis figure is not an all-time low because the UK\u2019s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.\n\nBut when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.\n\nAccording to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday \u2013 the first generation for which that is true.\n\nIt\u2019s the economy \u2026\n\nWhen the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.\n\nHannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.\n\nChildcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. \u201cThe family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.\u201d She and her partner are considering moving abroad.\n\nIn the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries \u2013 under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France \u2013 arrested declines over previous decades.\n\nIn the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK \u2019s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.\n\nFor all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cIn other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.\u201d\n\nTo measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fiona Powley, a trainer and facilitator who runs Bristol Childfree Women.\n\nThe consultancy\u2019s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.\n\n\u2026 but also other factors\n\nRecent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.\n\nBerrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty in the answers\u201d. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.\n\nFiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, \u201cthey talk about time and freedom: finances don\u2019t usually feature\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cA common judgment from others asks \u2018who will look after you when you\u2019re old?\u2019, to which most members might say they\u2019ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they\u2019ve not have the financial strain of children.\u201d\n\nSarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\n\n\u201cThese days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and \u2018I\u2019m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down\u2019,\u201d says Harper, who advised the David Cameron\u2019s government on the implications of an ageing society.\n\nPublic services\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.\n\nIn a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, \u201cthe size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,\u201d it said.\n\nAt the moment, the UK population is increasing \u2013 by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years \u2013 but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.\n\nWithout a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.\n\nSchools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to \u00a31bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.\n\nAccording to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.\n\nPrimary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.\n\nPupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.\n\nLooking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.\n\nWhat about ageing?\n\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?\n\nNik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.\n\n\u201cOne way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio \u2013 the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.\u201d\n\nJust as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.\n\nHarper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.\n\n\u201cMen in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,\u201d she says. \u201cMen who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won\u2019t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.\u201d\n\nHarper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.\n\nGiven that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people\u2019s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.\n\nBerrington says the implications for policymaking are \u201cvery significant \u2013 for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. \u201cPolicy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.\u201d\n\nPronatalist policies \u2013 those that attempt to boost the birthrate \u2013 are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.\n\nA report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. \u201cWe do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct \u2018population strategy\u2019 to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,\u201d it said.\n\nBerrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cAnd governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons \u2013 poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children \u2013 have relatively high inactivity rates.\u201d",

        "title": "What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?",
        "body": "Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you\u2019ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data \u2013 GDP, jobs, etc \u2013 and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nUniform patches\n\nOne known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there\u2019s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s underwear\n\nAsk any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.\n\nLipstick\n\nFor the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.\n\nOverseas freight\n\nWorld shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing?

It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.\n\nI\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.\n\nGoofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.",
        "summary": "So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?\n\u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.\nWhen lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds.\nWhere to research lipstick sales?\nOverseas freightWorld shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight.",

        "body": "Rishi Sunak abandoned his \u201clegacy\u201d policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.\n\nThe UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak\u2019s place in British political history.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK\u2019s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year.\n\nAfter months of fierce opposition from the industry \u2013 and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms \u2013 the proposal was excluded from the \u201cwash-up\u201d process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop.\n\nThe policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2009, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it.\n\nDocuments and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world\u2019s largest tobacco firms \u2013 the UK\u2019s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) \u2013 put ministers on notice of a legal backlash.\n\nImperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was \u201cunlawful\u201d because industry views had not been considered.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies.\n\nView image in fullscreen Imperial Brands sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK. Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nThe Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nImperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a \u201cjudicial review\u201d challenging the consultation process.\n\nGovernment lawyers responded by saying legal action might \u201cderail\u201d a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.\n\nBAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial\u2019s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.\n\nImperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was \u201ckeeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments\u201d.\n\nThe legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.\n\nPMI\u2019s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s UK subsidiary told the consultation it \u201cdid not support the age of sale ban as outlined\u201d, arguing instead for \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d on \u201ccombustible tobacco\u201d \u2013 ie cigarettes \u2013 instead of an outright ban.\n\nPMI told the Guardian the bill risked \u201cconfusing\u201d consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it \u201cfirmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK\u201d.\n\nBAT, which has previously advocated for a \u201csmokeless\u201d future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.\n\nAs the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a \u201cbusiness lunch\u201d with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company\u2019s annual party at the British Museum in London.\n\nIn May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak\u2019s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,\u201d JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the \u201copen dismissal of industry views in the decision making process\u201d.\n\nIts secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of \u201ctaking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness\u201d.\n\nA month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: \u201cThe principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one \u2026 We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.\u201d\n\nTwo Conservative MPs, including Badenoch\u2019s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved.\n\nThe Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a \u201cnanny state\u201d measure.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Sunak \u2018nanny state\u2019 beermat. Illustration: Howard McWilliam\n\nBadenoch\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch\u2019s department to join Imperial in January.\n\nStafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a \u201clover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information\u201d.\n\nHe and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group\u2019s position in a speech.\n\nThe government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.\n\nIn total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.\n\nBAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: \u201cWe are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative party did not return requests for comment.",

        "body": "If Labour triumphs in this week\u2019s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds\u2019s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking \u2013 and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster.\n\nTo recap, Britain\u2019s biggest water company has been labouring under an \u00a318bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts.\n\nIn March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged \u00a3500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber.\n\nIts finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a \u00a3150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March \u2013 hours before investors pulled the plug \u2013 was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company\u2019s potential collapse high on the party\u2019s \u201crisk register\u201d after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall.\n\nOne of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat\u2019s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft \u201cprice review 24\u201d \u2013 the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years \u2013 on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak\u2019s soggy early election announcement.\n\nThames\u2019s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat\u2019s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra \u00a31.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the \u00a318.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households.\n\nInvestors will be combing Ofwat\u2019s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat\u2019s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nThe documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend \u00a396bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants.\n\nThames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames\u2019s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d statement, as last year\u2019s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July.\n\nInvestors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration \u2013 in effect a temporary renationalisation.\n\nA source close to Kemble\u2019s creditors said: \u201cObviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.\u201d\n\nThis week, Reynolds said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to see a nationalisation\u201d of Thames. \u201cI think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,\u201d he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be.\n\nUnfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.",

The company had planned to shut one furnace by the end of June and a second by September.\n\nAbout 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata\u2019s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.\n\nThe company said: \u201cWe cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action.\u201d\n\nA Tata Steel spokesperson called on Unite to cancel the industrial action and said it had began legal action to \u201cchallenge the validity of Unite\u2019s ballot\u201d. Tata called on Unite to consider \u201cthe company\u2019s proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training, and skills development\u201d.\n\nThe decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday\u2019s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, have pledged up to \u00a33bn to support the industry\u2019s transition to low carbon steel production, which is expected to include honouring an existing \u00a3500m package of government support for Port Talbot. A new electric arc furnace will be built by the end of 2027.\n\nTorsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank who is standing as Labour candidate for Swansea West, said on X that Tata\u2019s decision was \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cSafety is of course paramount but Tata should avoid taking any action that cannot be reversed before seeing the result of the general election.\n\n\u201cWe need to see everyone getting round the table. It is crucial we don\u2019t lose the chance for the company and unions to sit down with an incoming Labour government, given the commitment from [Reynolds] and [Reeves] to a \u00a32.5bn steel renewal fund.\u201d\n\nOnay Kasab, Unite\u2019s national lead officer, said the union had asked for a meeting to discuss how to operate the site safely during the industrial action \u2013 the first steel strikes in 40 years \u2013 since it was called last week. He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.\n\nKasab said: \u201cTo issue that statement last night knowing full well the meeting was today \u2013 it\u2019s about trying to create fear and uncertainty among the workforce. Safety is paramount. Our argument is that the blast furnace does not have to be turned off before the electric arc furnace comes on, so of course we are not going to take action which means it is turned off.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the decision-makers in Mumbai to get involved in the discussions and we want Labour to stick to their commitment.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reynolds needs to sit down with the company to see to quickly put things in place.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, when launching Labour\u2019s election campaign in Wales last month, said he would \u201cfight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales\u201d.\n\nVaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: \u201cWe will not support the closure of both furnaces. This will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. He added: \u201cUrgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: \u201cTata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out.\n\n\u201cA better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake.\n\n\u201cIt will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.\n\nAssuming the polls are right \u2013 and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign \u2013 the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.\n\nBut in 1906, Arthur Balfour\u2019s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.\n\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that\u2019s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.\n\nLiving standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income \u2013 a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account \u2013 rose by 2.4% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don\u2019t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.\n\nOnly twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.\n\nIn the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\n\nAs it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOther recent developments \u2013 especially those overseas \u2013 are not so welcome. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the first round of voting in France\u2019s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen\u2019s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government.\n\nEvents in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.\n\nGlobalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures \u2013 not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.\n\nThe developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.\n\nSo those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation \u2013 the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis \u2013 when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.\n\nAnd an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",

        "body": "Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things \u2013 nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head \u2013 have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.\n\nThe seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism\u2019s approach to wealth generation \u2013 trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly \u201ccrowds out\u201d suppressed investment and enterprise \u2013 is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off \u2013 and transforming Labour into Britain\u2019s natural party of government.\n\nHis first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not \u201ccrowd out\u201d investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while \u201ccrowding in\u201d innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices \u2013 the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.\n\nThis is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as \u00a3100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by \u00a3100bn every year \u2013 the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors \u2013 while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.\n\nOne important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the \u00a31.4tn funds fossilised in Britain\u2019s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers\u2019 final year\u2019s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a \u00a31.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks \u2013 and the money made to work to accelerate Britain\u2019s investment recovery.\n\nThere is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour\u2019s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth \u00a333bn with a \u00a312bn investment surplus \u2013 one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another \u00a3600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.\n\nThe first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least \u00a3100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves should lift the facility to \u00a350bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to \u00a310bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth \u2013 without additional direct government borrowing. It\u2019s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nAgainst this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK\u2019s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped \u00a328bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.\n\nIn the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves\u2019 Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.\n\nSome in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.",

        "body": "To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers\u2019 rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. \u201cAngela Rayner\u2019s Britain?\u201d demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.\n\nTory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday\u2019s example, warning that Labour may make the UK\u2019s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.\n\nFor one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip \u2013 employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment \u2013 are popular with the public.\n\nRecent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one \u2013 including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.\n\nTwo things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un\u00adable to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic \u00a316 a week higher than in 2010 \u2013 despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d) under successive Conservative governments.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers \u2013 a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the \u00adsupport for public sector strikes last year.\n\nIt is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.\n\nFrom \u201cself-employed\u201d gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people\u2019s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.\n\nIn theory, Labour\u2019s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.\n\nSocial care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of \u201cfair pay agreements\u201d under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.\n\nUnions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership \u2013 something the GMB has only just won at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of \u201cworker\u201d, which comes with more obligations than rights.\n\nAs with so many areas of Labour\u2019s agenda, however, the details will be critical \u2013 as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.\n\nRegulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better\n\nBut Soames\u2019s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers \u2013 with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.\n\nThe necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour\u2019s plan to win Thursday\u2019s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?\n\nRegulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better.

        "body": "As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss\u2019s government and its \u201cdash for growth\u201d in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.\n\nBuoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.\n\nIn short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy\u2019s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.\n\nThere is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.\n\nThe Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.\n\nLabour has indicated it would try to \u201chardwire\u201d many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt \u201crule\u201d as the current Conservative party.\n\nThe challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.\n\nOne must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nAnother, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country\u2019s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "If you want evidence of Microsoft\u2019s progress towards its environmental \u201cmoonshot\u201d goal, then look closer to earth: at a building site on a west London industrial estate.\n\nThe company\u2019s Park Royal datacentre is part of its commitment to drive the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), but that ambition is jarring with its target of being carbon negative by 2030.\n\nMicrosoft says the centre will be run fully on renewable energy. However, the construction of datacentres and the servers they are filled with means that the company\u2019s scope 3 emissions \u2013 such as CO 2 related to the materials in its buildings and the electricity people consume when using products such as Xbox \u2013 are more than 30% above their 2020 level. As a result, the company is exceeding its overall emissions target by roughly the same rate.\n\nThis week, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, Bill Gates, claimed AI would help combat climate change because big tech is \u201cseriously willing\u201d to pay extra to use clean electricity sources in order \u201cto say that they\u2019re using green energy\u201d.\n\nIn the short term, AI has been problematic for Microsoft\u2019s green goals. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s outspoken president, once called its carbon ambitions a \u201cmoonshot\u201d. In May, stretching that metaphor to breaking point, he admitted that because of its AI strategy, \u201cthe moon has moved\u201d. It plans to spend \u00a32.5bn over the next three years on growing its AI datacentre infrastructure in the UK and this year has announced new datacentre projects around the world including in the US, Japan, Spain and Germany.\n\nTraining and operating the AI models that underpin products such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini uses a lot of electricity to power and cool the associated hardware, with additional carbon generated by making and transporting the related equipment.\n\n\u201cIt is a technology that is driving up energy consumption,\u201d says Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a website monitoring the environmental impact of new technologies.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres\u2019 total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to 1,000 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, equivalent to the energy demand of Japan. AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, according to calculations by research firm SemiAnalysis.\n\nIt means that amid the concerns about AI\u2019s impact on jobs and humanity\u2019s longevity, the environment is featuring, too. Last week, the International Monetary Fund said governments should consider imposing carbon taxes to capture the environmental cost of AI, in the form of a general carbon levy that captures emissions from servers as part of its reach, or other methods such as a specific tax on CO 2 generated by that equipment.\n\nAll the big tech firms involved in AI \u2013 Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft \u2013 are seeking renewable energy resources to meet their climate targets. In January, Amazon, the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, announced it had bought more than half the output of an offshore windfarm in Scotland, while Microsoft said in May it was backing $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in renewable energy projects. Google aims to run its datacentres entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said: \u201cWe remain resolute in our commitment to meet our climate goals.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, who left in 2020 but retains a stake in the company via the Gates Foundation Trust, has argued that AI can directly help fight climate change. The extra electricity demand would be matched by new investments in green generation, he said on Thursday, which would more than compensate for the use.\n\nA recent UK government-backed report agreed, stating that the \u201ccarbon intensity of the energy source is a key variable\u201d in calculating AI-related emissions, although it adds that \u201ca significant portion of AI training globally still relies on high-carbon sources such as coal or natural gas\u201d. The water needed to cool servers is also an issue, with one study estimating that AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic meters of water use by 2027 \u2013 nearly two-thirds of England\u2019s annual consumption.\n\nDe Vries argues that the chase for sustainable computing power puts a strain on demand for renewable energy, which would result in fossil fuels picking up the slack in other sections of the global economy.\n\n\u201cMore energy consumption means we don\u2019t have enough renewables to feed that increase,\u201d he says.\n\nView image in fullscreen Server rooms in a datacentres are energy hungry. Photograph: i3D_VR/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nNexGen Cloud, a UK firm that provides sustainable cloud computing, a datacentre-reliant industry that delivers IT services such as data storage and computing power over the internet, says renewable energy sources for AI-related computing are available for datacentres if they avoid cities and are sited next to sources of hydro or geothermal power.\n\nYoulian Tzanev, NexGen Cloud\u2019s co-founder, says:\n\n\u201cThe industry norm has been to build around economic hubs rather than sources of renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThis makes it more difficult for any AI-focused tech company to hit carbon goals. Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider, aims to be net zero \u2013 removing as much carbon as it emits \u2013 by 2040 and to match its global electricity use with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Google and Meta are pursuing the same net zero goal by 2030. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, uses Microsoft datacentres to train and operate its products.\n\nThere are two key ways in which large language models \u2013 the technology that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini \u2013 consume energy. The first is the training phase, where a model is fed reams of data culled from the internet and beyond, and builds a statistical understanding of language itself, which ultimately enables it to churn out convincing-looking answers to queries.\n\nThe upfront energy cost of training AI is astronomical. That keeps smaller companies (and even smaller governments) from competing in the sector, if they do not have a spare $100m to throw at a training run. But it is dwarfed by the cost of actually running the resulting models, a process known as \u201cinference\u201d. According to analyst Brent Thill, at the investment firm Jefferies, 90% of the energy cost of AI sits in that inference phase: the electricity used when people ask an AI system to respond to factual queries, summarise a chunk of text or write an academic essay.\n\nThe electricity used for training and inference is funnelled through an enormous and growing digital infrastructure. The datacentres are filled with servers, which are built from the ground up for the specific part of the AI workload they sit in. A single training server may have a central processing unit (CPU) barely more powerful than the one in your own computer, paired with tens of specialised graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) \u2013 microchips designed to rapidly plough through the vast quantities of simple calculations that AI models are made of.\n\nIf you use a chatbot, as you watch it spit out answers word by word, a powerful GPU is using about a quarter of the power required to boil a kettle. All of this is being hosted by a datacentre, whether owned by the AI provider itself or a third party \u2013 in which case it might be called \u201cthe cloud\u201d, a fancy name for someone else\u2019s computer.\n\nSemiAnalysis estimates that if generative AI was integrated into every Google search this could translate into annual energy consumption of 29.2 TWh, comparable with what Ireland consumes in a year, although the financial cost to the tech company would be prohibitive. That has led to speculation that the search company may start charging for some AI tools.\n\nBut some argue that looking at the energy overhead for AI is the wrong lens. Instead, consider the energy the new tools can save. A provocative paper in Nature\u2019s peer-reviewed Scientific Reports journal earlier this year argued that the carbon emissions of writing and illustrating are lower for AI than for humans.\n\nAI systems emit \u201cbetween 130 and 1,500 times\u201d less carbon dioxide a page of text generated compared with human writers, the researchers from University of California Irvine estimated, and up to 2,900 times less an image.\n\nLeft unsaid, of course, is what those human writers and illustrators are doing instead. Redirecting and retraining their labour in another field \u2013 such as green jobs \u2013 could be another moonshot.",

Parents talked frequently of fairness and were at pains to explain how they must treat all children the same, even if the government doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give money to one and not the other and it\u2019s not their fault they were born after the government brought a rule in.\u201d Carol\u2019s children are 16, 11, eight and four and has supported her family on her own on the wage she brings in, and on universal credit.\n\nView image in fullscreen Matthew and Lucy stop for drinks and snacks at the park.\n\nShe works three days a week, and gets \u00a3909 a month in the child element of universal credit for three children - her eldest was born pre-2016 so has always been eligible for payments. In May, her income was \u00a32,753 in total for her and the four children, and her rent is \u00a31,140. Earlier this month, she got married, which means universal credit payments will reduce when she starts living with her new partner.\n\n\u201cI could work more hours, but when would I see them and I need to make sure there\u2019s a decent meal on the table,\u201d she says.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nathan, Faith and Logan at the sports pitch. Mum Leanne says the financial strain of three children wasn\u2019t noticeable when her daughter was a baby but it\u2019s got hard as they have all got older.\n\nIn Manchester, mother-of-three Leanne, receives \u00a3584.58 a month for her two eldest sons from universal credit, but not for her daughter, six. Altogether, she is living on \u00a31,200 a month with shopping, gas and electric bills, council tax, water, TV licence coming out of that and travel costs to the local hospital to take one of her sons to various appointments.\n\n\u201cThe rule came into force in the April of 2017 and I had my daughter in the October. I thought \u2018how am I going to support her through two children\u2019s money?\u2019\n\n\u201cI think it was as she was getting older and going on to solid foods and we needed more money for shopping. I also had my second boy, who was only young then, so that was two kids in nappies at home,\u201d shesays.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leanne\u2019s boys (and their friend) enjoy spending hours at the local playing fields playing football.\n\nView image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Faith, drawing at home. The two-child limit rule came into force six months before Leanne\u2019s daughter was born in 2017. Nathan, Leanne\u2019s eldest son looks out at across their local sports pitch to see who has the ball.\n\nHer eldest boys, 11 and eight, also love football and go and play at the local park, and at the local football club as much as they can. She also takes them to all the free activities that are put on locally, and saves money on food where she can.\n\n\u201cMore parents are struggling because of this rule and more parents are behind on rent, housing. People can\u2019t afford shopping. I do struggle.\n\n\u201cI never suffered from any anxiety until I had my youngest daughter.\u201d\n\nThe UK government\u2019s universal credit payments are now set at \u00a3333.33 for a first child if they were born before 6 April 2017, and \u00a3287.92 if they were born after that date. The payment for a second child is also \u00a3287.92.\n\nView image in fullscreen Single parent Joanna, 38.\n\nSingle parent Joanna, 38, in London, earns \u00a343k a year in London in a full time job and receives the child element of universal credit for her eldest son and daughter.

The rest of her income comes from universal credit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never get to go on a holiday with my kids that isn\u2019t to visit family. I\u2019ll never be able to give each of my kids their own bedroom. I\u2019ll never be able to have a car, I\u2019ll never be able to own property.

        "body": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.\n\nRecent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.\n\nAndresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.\n\n\u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An earnings limit means you do not qualify for carer\u2019s allowance if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week. Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy\n\nWith just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.\n\nCarer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.\n\nCarers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.\n\nThose who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nCarers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen A recent survey found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with the cost of living. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\n\u201cRemoving unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,\u201d Walker says.\n\nShe says the low level of the payments doesn\u2019t recognise what carers do, \u201cand there are clear problems in the way that it\u2019s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d\n\nStephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d\n\nAmong proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.\n\nWalker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d",

        "body": "UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.\n\nA number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.\n\nHowever, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.\n\nMark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThis is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.\u201d\n\nLucinda O\u2019Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: \u201cNow is the time to act, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs.\n\nMany of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.\n\nAt the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.\n\nThese require a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires \u00a310,000 to open an account.\n\nHowever, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d.\n\nThis is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively.\n\nOther providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d\n\nIt is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.\n\nLoyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.",
        "summary": "UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.\nA number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.\nAt the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more.\nThese include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.\nOther providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%).",

        "body": "Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute \u201cgrace period\u201d before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.\n\nThe measure is part of a new code of practice that private car-park companies have promised to introduce in the autumn. Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of \u00a3100 \u2013 reduced to \u00a360 if paid within 14 days.\n\nHowever, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.\n\nThe AA\u2019s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: \u201cThis self-authored code doesn\u2019t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees \u2026 These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.\u201d\n\nThe code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.\n\nIt also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an \u201cappeals charter\u201d for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.\n\nParking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.\n\nPoliticians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses \u2013 which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year \u2013 for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.\n\nA bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to \u00a350, among a number of other measures.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.\n\nI see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging \u00a340 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.\n\nML, by email\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.\n\nIt is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge \u2013 one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.\n\nI asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.\n\n\u201cThe fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWith reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.\u201d\n\nIf everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this \u00a340 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The wrapper contains information related to the manufacturer\u2019s identity and country-specific information in different languages, CPSC added.\n\nAccording to the CPSC, the resins contain acrylates, a chemical agent made from acrylic acid, in amounts prohibited in children\u2019s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. After the resins harden, they no longer pose a risk.\n\nMGA Entertainment has received 26 reports of incidents with this product affecting children and adults. Those include reports of burns and irritation, respiratory irritation, as well as one report of a consumer\u2019s asthma being triggered.\n\nIn addition to the toy sets being recalled across the US, there are 1m recalls that have been issued across Canada.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the MGA Entertainment CEO, Isaac Larian, said that the product had been on the market for 18 months and that only 10% to 15% of the recalled products contain liquid resin.\n\nFrom October 2022 through June 2024, the sets, which were manufactured in China and ranged in price from $7 to $13, were sold at Target, Walmart, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Aldi and Hobby Lobby, in addition to other stores and Amazon.com. Some sets were also sold in a box ranging in price from $14 to $52.\n\nIn an FAQ document posted online, MGA Entertainment said that the remedy upon returning a recalled set with unused resin is the consumer\u2019s choice of a replacement product or a refund. MGA Entertainment also said it will pay for return shipping labels.\n\nThe Guardian has reached out to MGA Entertainment for comment.",

Find your demographic\n\nThe competition is stiff, so finding the right place to sell your clothes will give you the best chance of getting them in front of people who might want to buy them.\n\n\u201cDepop tends to appeal more to gen Z, so it doesn\u2019t really suit the pieces I\u2019m selling, while Vinted has a wide range of buyers of all ages,\u201d says Becky Barnes, a sustainable stylist. \u201cOne of my most successful places for selling shoes and clothes is the local community Facebook page. As a seller, it\u2019s easier because you don\u2019t have to package up and send things \u2013 people almost always want to collect.\u201d\n\n2. Provide clear photos\n\nWhether you show an item on a hanger, or post pictures of you wearing the garment, try to get a selection of clear photos from different angles, with closeups of the fabric, and include a shot of the label and care instructions.\n\nTake them in lighting that shows them as they really are \u2013 Natacha Blanchard from Vinted recommends putting clothes against a white background so their outline is clear.\n\nKirsty Keoghan, global general manager of fashion at eBay, says people selling items on the site can use its background removal tool to create a more attractive image, and its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sellers on eBay can use its its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\n3. Be descriptive and honest\n\nUse more keywords than you think you need \u2013 this will help buyers find your items when they search.\n\nBlanchard says: \u201cSometimes the colour does not appear in the photo as it does in real life, so I always pay attention to that.\u201d If it is not possible to take photos in good lighting that shows the true colours, she will point out on the description that the shade is lighter or darker than it looks.\n\nAlways be clear about sizing, too. If something comes up smaller or larger than you would expect, mention it. \u201cInclude your basic measurements \u2013 height, bust, waist and hips \u2013 so people can immediately tell if something will fit,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cIt does take a bit more time, but it\u2019s worth getting the tape measure out and including those key measurements so that people are understanding what they are buying.\u201d\n\nIf there are any defects, scratches or snags, mention these in your post, and include pictures of those parts. \u201cI always try to think about selling as if I were buying \u2013 what would I need to know about an item, what information would I want to see?\u201d says Blanchard.\n\n4. Get the timing right\n\nThink seasonally. \u201cAt this time of year, I would be thinking about selling summer dresses and things that suit the season. In October it would be coats and warmer clothing,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nIf you have had a clearout and really want to shift things quickly, be prepared to go low on prices or you may find it difficult to sell.\n\nThe timing of your post counts, too \u2013 holding off and posting when buyers are actively browsing can ensure your listing appears high on the page and gets more views.\n\n\u201cWe know more people are actively listing on Saturdays, and people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nView image in fullscreen An expert from Vinted says people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays.

Instead, it is wise to post a few things each day.\n\nKatie Rowe, who sells clothes on Depop, says: \u201cI post every day to be as consistent as I can to maximise my exposure.\u201d\n\nBarnes agrees: \u201cIf I had 10 items, I wouldn\u2019t upload all in one go to the same platform. I would add two or three a day, every day, just to try to keep myself at the top of the algorithm.\u201d\n\n6. Use bundles and discounts\n\nOn sites such as Vinted and Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items from you.\n\nYou get to choose the percentage you would like to take off when you set up your account. It is attractive to the buyer because, on top of the discount, they will pay less for postage.\n\n\u201cI sometimes make bundle offers through the Depop app, meaning that if a buyer buys two or more items, they can get a percentage off the final price,\u201d says Amber Ramon, a regular seller on Depop.\n\nView image in fullscreen On Depop and Vinted, Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items.

Be friendly in negotiations\n\nOnline selling frequently requires interaction with buyers.\n\n\u201cVinted, and other platforms, are about individuals, and if you list on Vinted, you have to be ready to engage. Potential buyers might have lots of questions,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cBe prepared for negotiations \u2013 people will try to buy for less. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\n8. Pack and ship well\n\nPack items carefully and make sure they are protected. \u201cSome people like to be creative with their packaging,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cThat can range from packing really carefully to including a little note when sending items. Everyone has their own approach.\u201d\n\nWhatever yours is, be prompt with packing and sending. If you have happy customers, they may return to your page. But perhaps, more importantly, they will give you positive feedback, which will reassure subsequent buyers that you are trustworthy.\n\nView image in fullscreen Be prompt with packing and sending to ensure you get good feedback on sites such as eBay. Photograph: Alisha Arif/Alamy\n\n9. Check selling fees\n\nListing items is often free on secondhand platforms: eBay recently removed fees for private sellers of pre-owned clothes (sellers and buyers must be in the UK), and many platforms charge buyers, rather than sellers.\n\nFor example, buyers pay a \u201cbuyer protection\u201d fee of between 3% and 8% of the pre-postage price on each Vinted purchase, plus between 30p and 80p.\n\nDepop has a marketplace fee of about 5% plus \u00a31, also charged to buyers. While it does not have a seller\u2019s fee per se, there is a processing charge for payments, the service through which payments are received. Sellers pay 2.9% of the sale price (including postage cost) plus 30p.\n\n10. Check tax requirements\n\nMost people will not have to pay tax on the items they sell online. However, as of January this year, HM Revenue and Customs has required online marketplaces and other \u201cdigital platforms\u201d to collect and report information on how much money their users make.\n\nWebsites in countries that have signed up to rules set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development must gather data on UK-resident sellers and share it with HMRC.\n\nTax experts and sites such as MoneySavingExpert.com say platforms will only report information to HMRC automatically if someone is selling 30 or more items a year, or makes more than the equivalent of \u20ac2,000 a year from this activity (a little under \u00a31,700 at the time of writing).\n\nSeparately, everyone has a trading allowance each tax year, which means they can earn up to \u00a31,000 without paying tax.\n\nHMRC has a tool that lets you check if there is anything you need to do.",

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority.

        "title": "Labour to seek \u2018stable position\u2019 with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate",
        "body": "Labour would rather have stability in the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU\u2019s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.\n\nAddressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been \u201cvery difficult for businesses\u201d because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.\n\nWith less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.\n\nSome business leaders and economists have said Labour\u2019s hopes to grow the economy \u2013 and thereby pay for improved public services \u2013 could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.\n\n\u201cYou could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.\u201d\n\nKemi Badenoch, Reynolds\u2019s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the \u201cpower of business to do good\u201d.\n\nHowever, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on \u201cmy favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics\u201d.\n\nBadenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy \u2013 an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May \u2013 was \u201cmorally repellent\u201d and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to \u201censhrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people\u201d as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.\n\nShevaun Haviland, the BCC\u2019s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d and try to improve the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that \u201cbusinesses don\u2019t want a renegotiation\u201d.\n\nAmanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that \u201can air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy\u201d and that some of the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.\n\nLabour\u2019s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party\u2019s relationship with business was \u201cone of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019\u201d.\n\nHe was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour\u2019s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told by some commentators they don\u2019t think Labour\u2019s campaign is exciting enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, my friends, we\u2019re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we\u2019re not putting on politics as entertainment.\u201d",

        "body": "Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK\u2019s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nOfficials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said.\n\nBut it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.\n\n\u201cPolicy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,\u201d the Bank\u2019s financial stability report said. Questions over a country\u2019s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was \u201crelevant to UK financial stability\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.\n\nThat includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.\n\nIn total, about 3 million \u2013 or 35% \u2013 of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders \u2013 including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level \u2013 could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.\n\nThere are also concerns about the financial system\u2019s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.\n\n\u201cAlthough the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,\u201d the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.\n\nPolicymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK\u2019s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and \u201csevere\u201d economic shocks.\n\nThe first \u2013 a \u201csupply-shock scenario\u201d echoing the ripple effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.\n\nThe second \u201cdemand-shock scenario\u201d \u2013 which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns \u2013 assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.\n\nThis year\u2019s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

Labour and the Conservatives have been criticised for their reluctance to discuss how successful Brexit has been and future policies towards the EU.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month, Keir Starmer had to deny that he was scared of talking about the issue, instead saying he was determined to build a \u201ccloser, better\u201d relationship with the EU and improve Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cbotched deal\u201d.\n\nBusinesses have criticised the additional red tape and increased costs that Brexit has heaped on to firms importing and exporting goods to and from the continent.\n\nImporters of food and plants have been hit by charges associated with new Brexit border checks brought in at the end of April, with some logistics companies saying the changes have added up to 60% to transport costs.\n\nOther businesses have complained that the increasing divergence on standards, such as those around construction products, has made it more expensive for UK companies to get their products certified for sale on the continent.\n\nThe comments from Haviland come as the BCC makes improving relations with the EU one of its key requests for the next government, saying the step would reduce costs for businesses.\n\nThe trade body is made up of 53 regional chambers of commerce affiliated to a central body and says it represents 50,000 businesses in the UK, which collectively employ six million people.\n\nIts requests cover several specific policies, including securing a supplementary deal with the EU to remove the complexity of exporting food for small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensuring there are no new trade barriers created by linking the UK and EU emissions trading schemes.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM\u2019s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around \u00a3176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world\u2019s biggest coal shipper, is \u201cphasing down\u201d its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century.

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles.

Today\u2019s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share\n\n5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says \u201cthe recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected\u201d in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain\u2019s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect \u201crobust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation\u201d, Gruenwald explains. Share\n\n5d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached \u201cthe beginning of the end-game\u201d, as some \u2013 such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank \u2013 have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is \u201cjust the flipside\u201d of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want?

The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI\u2019s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj \u2014 CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below \u201caverage\u201d for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).\n\nOrders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: \u201cLast month\u2019s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it\u2019s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it\u2019s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK\u2019s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.\u201d Share\n\n5d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX\u2019s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of \u201cmaterial Scope 3 emissions\u201d that fail to account for its material value chains\u2019 emissions. Today\u2019s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM\u2019s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this \u201cstewardship\u201d of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.\u201d Share",

The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.\n\nDr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as \u201ca new climate and human health threat\u201d and urged air freight companies to \u201cend their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail\u201d.\n\nAir freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.\n\nThe researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon\u2019s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.\n\nThe researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.\n\nThe report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.\n\nBy 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.\n\nFedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry\u2019s carbon emissions in 2023. It is estimated that 99.8% of aviation fuel is produced from fossil fuels, with the scaling of low carbon replacements a distant prospect.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.\n\nOn one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.\n\nThis increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\n\nAlarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.\n\nAlthough the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThese measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration\u2019s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe new US tariffs could extend beyond China\u2019s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.\n\nTo be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies \u2013 often in the form of cheap credit \u2013 have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.\n\nAdmittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.\n\nWith US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition \u2013 if we were to embrace it.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University.

        "body": "Your editorial rightly points out that GDP is not a good measure of how people are faring (19 June). As an alternative, you offer the UN\u2019s human development index. But we already have a better British alternative \u2013 the measure of life satisfaction in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 annual population survey.\n\nThe question asked is: \u201cOverall, how satisfied are you with your life these days (0: not at all satisfied, 10: completely)?\u201d The results are published every quarter. That is an excellent measure of the nation\u2019s success. It provides a good account of how we are doing on average and of the degree of fundamental inequality in our society.\n\nIt should become the objective of government policy to maximise wellbeing, measured in this way. As Thomas Jefferson said: \u201cThe life and happiness of the people ... is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\u201d And Keir Starmer has said that \u201cwith every pound spent on your behalf, we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on actual income but also its effect on wellbeing\u201d. So let us hope that the new government will judge all its policy options by their effects (per pound spent) on the life satisfaction of the population.\n\nProf Richard Layard\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nThe Guardian is correct to agree with the late Robert Kennedy, who said in 1968 that growth figures measured everything \u201cexcept that which makes life worthwhile\u201d. More than 50 years later, it is important to recognise that a thriving economy makes an important contribution to the UK\u2019s collective wellbeing. But GDP remains a poor measure of social progress. It measures criminal activity, but not caring responsibilities, and takes no account of the impact on public health or the planet.\n\nThat is why the next government should ground its decision-making in a wide range of statistics that measure our collective wellbeing. Ministers need to complement GDP data with a broad basket of figures about the reality of our lives and our impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, Carnegie\u2019s Life in the UK Index revealed yawning gaps in wellbeing between different groups in society. Only when similar datasets are used to underpin policymaking will governments have any hope of properly tackling the biggest problems of our time.\n\nSarah Davidson\n\nChief executive, Carnegie UK\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the public don\u2019t necessarily understand what GDP means, many politicians and journalists don\u2019t seem to know how GDP is calculated. As the economist Richard J Murphy has pointed out, \u201c10% of GDP is made up\u201d. When calculating GDP, the average cost of renting is used to figure out how much money owner-occupiers would be spending if they rented rather than owned their homes. This is called \u201cimputed rents\u201d and it accounts for around 10% of GDP.\n\nBut does it make sense to call rent a productive part of the economy? If all landlords raised their rents massively, this would appear on GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d, when in reality, no new goods or services would have been produced. It\u2019s the same with private equity \u2013 if a financial investor buys and then asset-strips a company, this will appear in GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d. But again, nothing has been produced, and therefore highly unproductive economic exchanges can appear in the GDP statistics as \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\nLooking at GDP in isolation is in practice about as useful as relying on the position of celestial bodies to tell you about your love life.\n\nEthan Oshoko\n\nSt Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex",

Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: \u201cConfidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that\u2019s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future.

Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates \u2013 which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals \u2013 appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.

        "body": "A human rights group has urged Britain\u2019s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein\u2019s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein\u2019s cotton suppliers in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.\n\nRepresented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that \u201cany attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused\u201d.\n\nThe China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (\u00a352bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein\u2019s potential London listing would be a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: \u201cShein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company\u2019s supply chains.\n\nThe group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK\u2019s convention obligations, it said.\n\n\u201cThe FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: \u201cStop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn\u2019t the place to come for a \u2018no questions asked\u2019 approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange\u2019s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein\u2019s supply chains.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign group\u2019s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the \u201caccuracy of its published modern slavery statement\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnder the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.\n\nBefore a company\u2019s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company\u2019s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA\u2019s role to independently verify the accurate of information.\n\nMichael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: \u201cA firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "From 7d ago 09.50 CEST Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules Newsflash: Brussels has accused Apple of restricting competition on its app store. European commissioner Thierry Breton has announced that the EU will take action against Apple under its new digital regulations, the Digital Markets Act. Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\n\n\n\nToday we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore & iOS comply with the DMA. \u201cAct different\u201d should be their new slogan\ud83c\udf4f\n\n\n\nFor too long @Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\n\n\n\nToday we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore & iOS comply with #DMA pic.twitter.com/e741oV9r9l \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) June 24, 2024 The EU are also investigating whether Apple\u2019s developer fees breached the bloc\u2019s rules, the Financial Times reports, adding: As part of the new probe into developer fees, Brussels said it was looking at whether Apple was imposing too many restrictions for users to download and install alternative app stores. Share\n\n7d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. \u201cIt\u2019s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then\u201d, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. \u201cWe don\u2019t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,\u201d Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally\u2026 Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests\u2019 leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is \u201cvery much focused\u201d on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a \u201cquite exceptional\u201d job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month\u2019s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now \u201cterrified\u201d at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was \u201cno better job\u201d than Business and Trade Secretary, which \u201cis a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister\u201d. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats\u2026 would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before\u2026. That doesn\u2019t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid\u2026 and appears to leave the door open for one\u2026. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d situation; she doesn\u2019t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its \u00a315.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK\u2019s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share\n\n7d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer\u2026]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the \u201chighest standards\u201d on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers\u2019 homes, meaning they fall below the \u00a3135 threshold for import duty \u201cThat could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,\u201d Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share\n\n7d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What\u2019s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an \u201cobvious place to look for that\u201d money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and \u2018make the case\u2019 for investing in Britain. \u2018It won\u2019t take as long as people think\u2019: Rachel Reeves on being \u2018scrappy\u2019 \u2013 and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour\u2019s plans come from the \u201creasonable complaints\u201d of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn\u2019t know the country\u2019s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST\n\n7d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. \u201cWe will look again\u201d at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers \u2013 that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money\u2026. Share\n\n7d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven\u2019t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share\n\n7d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union \u2013 starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that \u2018relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they\u2019re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won\u2019t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don\u2019t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn\u2019t accept it. She insists the UK can\u2019t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share\n\n7d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it\u2019s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. \u201cThose are facts\u201d. Well\u2026.. this thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.\n\nWe'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.\n\nIt's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\nActually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that \"leapfrogging\" notion is wrong.\n\nIf anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.\n\nRaising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?\n\nBrexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.\n\nIf u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.\n\nFilm I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.\n\nEven tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest \"exports\" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.\n\nThe @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.\n\nAnd this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.\n\nAre we still in fourth place?\n\nIn short: no.\n\nLook, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.\n\nIn fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015. Which is consistent with other datapoints. pic.twitter.com/POeOJU04pf \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Share\n\n7d ago 14.53 CEST Reynolds: Need to escape low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop Next issue \u2013 fiscal issues, and the IMF\u2019s warning that both major parties\u2019 manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum\u2026. Kemi Badenoch says she \u201ccompletely disagrees\u201d with IFS\u2019s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS\u2019s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS\u2026. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don\u2019t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says \u2013 and that\u2019s Labour\u2019s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won\u2019t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that\u2019s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government\u2019s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share\n\n7d ago 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour\u2019s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour\u2019s manifesto is \u201ca pro-worker, pro-business\u201d agenda, that \u2013 he says \u2013 has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that \u201cThe floor will rise\u201d, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it\u2019s businesses don\u2019t want these measures. She claims it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour\u2019s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are \u201cterrible regulations\u201d. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn\u2019t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won\u2019t accept this, telling business leaders they should be \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of \u201csurrendering\u201d your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are \u201cfishing in an empty barrel\u201d, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Share Updated at 14.52 CEST\n\n7d ago 14.25 CEST Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change\u2026 \u2026and blames Liz Truss\u2019s \u201cdisastrous mini-budget\u201d for forcing Labour to drop its \u00a328bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak\u2019s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers.

        "body": "London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.\n\nThe company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.\n\nThe group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise \u00a330m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.\n\nThe decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.\n\nAt the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: \u201cThis unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London\u2019s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.\u201d\n\nThe change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.\n\nIn May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.\n\nHowever, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.\n\nThe Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.\n\nInstead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond novels.\n\nThe tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that it would then look to raise a further \u00a3120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.",

Pic: OVO\n\nIn recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.\n\nIn May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.\n\nMr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.\n\nHe is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nFour major banks hit by glitches\n\nExit from recession stronger than first thought\n\nEx-Fujitsu engineer denies 'protecting the monster'\n\nKey to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.\n\nOVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (\u00a3395m) valuation.\n\nKaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.\n\nOVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.\n\nIn 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of \u00a31.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.\n\nIt said this had \"no cash impact\" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nLast summer, the company announced a \u00a3200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.\n\nOther investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.\n\nMayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.\n\nThis weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.\n\nLike its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.\n\nLast month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of \u00a3122, to \u00a31568.\n\nOther big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over \u00a37bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.\n\nCentrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of \u00a37.3bn.\n\nOVO, whose valuation in any major transaction was unclear this weekend, declined to comment.",

I believe that I told the truth as I understood it at the time.\"\n\n\"You were a Fujitsu man doing what Fujitsu needed you to do to protect the monster,\" Ms Page put to him.\n\nMr Jenkins said: \"I didn't think it was a monster.\"\n\nDuring his evidence, Mr Jenkins has said he was sorry for what happened to Mrs Misra.\n\nShe told Sky News on Tuesday that she would not accept that apology.",

        "body": "boytsov\n\nAfter more than a year in the penalty box for slower growth and weaker consumer spending, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has been on a recent tear. Driven by both a combination of well-received earnings prints as well as being talked up by the meme stock pundit \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d Chewy is now up ~15% year to date.\n\nYet amid the sharp recent rise, we do have to ask ourselves: how much strength has already been priced in, and can the rally keep going?\n\nData by YCharts\n\nI last wrote a bullish article on Chewy in March, when the stock was still trading at a mere ~$18 per share. I had argued at the time that a reasonable valuation, share buybacks, and expanding margins would help drive the stock toward a rebound. Since then, Chewy has skyrocketed more than 70%, obliging me to re-assess my previous thesis on this company.\n\nYes - it\u2019s true that Chewy\u2019s recent Q1 earnings print, released in late May, showed a very positive margin story. Higher gross margins helped to feed substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which prompted the company to raise its full-year outlook. But now we do have to ask ourselves: how much of this strength is already priced in?\n\nAt current levels, I see a more balanced bull and bear thesis for this company, and I\u2019m downgrading the stock to a neutral rating.\n\nHere are the positives I still see for Chewy:\n\nBeloved consumer brand that is a clear category leader. Chewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans.\n\nChewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans. Margin expansion was driven by expanding product categories. Chewy's push to grow its own brand (Tylee's), plus focus more on selling higher-margin hardgoods, has proven very effective at producing margin expansion. Gross margins have recently expanded to ~29%, vs. low-20s at the onset of the pandemic. In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment.\n\nChewy's push to grow its own brand (Tylee's), plus focus more on selling higher-margin hardgoods, has proven very effective at producing margin expansion.

In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment. Nascent opportunities in pet telehealth and pet insurance. The craze in telehealth and doctor consultations via your mobile device is spilling over into the pet world, too. The company's \"Chewy Health\" offering has built out a \"Connect With A Vet\" service, and it also has rolled out a pet pharmacy as well. In August, the company rolled out its \"CarePlus\" pet insurance plan, which was recently bolstered through a new partnership with Lemonade's (LMND) pet insurance vertical. This is a broad, new opportunity for Chewy that can both accelerate its growth and grow its margins.\n\nAnd yet now, I do see a number of risks as well:\n\nCommoditized product. While Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains.\n\nWhile Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains. Decelerating growth. Despite the shift in focus to the margin story, Chewy is still ultimately a low-margin retailer that requires economies of scale; and it hasn\u2019t been able to slow its pace of deceleration.\n\nWe can also no longer quite make the argument that Chewy is cheap. At current share prices near $27, the company trades at a market cap of $11.87 billion. And after we net off the $1.14 billion in cash off the company\u2019s latest balance sheet (much of which is earmarked for buybacks), the company\u2019s resulting enterprise value is $10.73 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, as shown in the chart below, the company has updated its guidance to $11.6-$11.8 billion in revenue (4-6% y/y growth) and a 4.1-4.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, compared to a prior outlook of 3.8% adjusted EBITDA margins on the same revenue profile.\n\nChewy outlook (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)\n\nThe midpoint of Chewy\u2019s latest outlook calls for $491.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. This puts the stock\u2019s valuation multiple at 21.8x EV/FY24 adjusted EBITDA.\n\nTo me, the stock\u2019s rising margin profile is balanced against slower growth, and I\u2019m not willing to pay a >20x multiple of current-year EBITDA. I\u2019m happily locking in gains (especially as \u201cmeme stock rallies\u201d can tend to be shorter-lived in nature) and moving to the sidelines for a better entry point down the road.\n\nQ1 download\n\nLet\u2019s now go through the company\u2019s latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q1 earnings summary is shown below:\n\nChewy Q1 results (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)\n\nRevenue grew just 3.1% y/y to $2.88 billion, ahead of Wall Street\u2019s $2.85 billion expectations (2.1% growth). But as can be seen in the chart below, growth has been decelerating sharply over the past few quarters, and fell 120bps sequentially from 4.3% growth in Q4. Only a year ago, Chewy had been growing revenue in the mid-teens.\n\nChewy trended revenue (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)\n\nThe good news: despite weaker macro conditions for discretionary pet spending, Chewy notes that it has been able to retain customers as well as reactivate lapsed customers at a better rate than expected. Per CEO Sumit Singh\u2019s remarks on the Q1 earnings call:\n\nOur Autoship customer base remains healthy and is continuing to grow. Further, on the topic of customers this quarter, we saw some encouraging customer trends. The work we have been doing to sharpen our already strong value proposition, for example, through pet type personalization began to pay off this quarter. Our efforts are driving higher response rates and had a positive effect on net new customers as well as reactivated customers, which were particularly strong in the quarter and up mid-teens relative to the prior year period. Notably for the first time since 2022, both new customer acquisition and reactivations modestly exceeded our internal expectations in Q1.\"\n\nAdditionally encouraging was a continued trend in rising gross margins. As shown below, gross margins rose 130bps y/y and 150bps sequentially to an all time record of 29.7%. The boost in margins was primarily driven by revenue mix, as the company\u2019s sponsored ads and insurance sales have become a slightly more meaningful percentage of company revenue.\n\nChewy gross margins (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)\n\nOpex cost controls have also helped to push Adjusted EBITDA up to $163 million: up 47% y/y and also representing an EBITDA margin record of 5.7%, up 170bps y/y.\n\nChewy adjusted EBITDA (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)\n\nKey takeaways\n\nIn my view, the market has already given Chewy plenty of credit for its goody in profits and margin expansion. With its higher valuation, I\u2019d prefer to de-risk my position and move to the sidelines.",

        "title": "Flushing Financial: Dividend Yield Of Over 6%, Earnings Likely To Recover (NASDAQ:FFIC)",
        "body": "mbbirdy\n\nAfter falling in the first quarter of 2024, earnings of Flushing Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:FFIC) will likely recover the remainder of the year on the back of loan growth. I\u2019m expecting the company to report earnings of $0.79 per share for 2024 and $1.01 per share for 2025. The year-end target price suggests a high upside from the current market price. Further, FFIC is offering a very attractive dividend yield of 6.7%. However, there is a small threat of a dividend cut. Based on the total expected return, I\u2019m adopting a buy rating on Flushing Financial Corporation.\n\nMargin Likely to Stabilize\n\nFlushing Financial Corporation\u2019s earnings have faced pressure of late because of net interest margin contraction. The margin dipped by 23 basis points during the first quarter of 2024. Further, the average margin for 2023 was 87 basis points below the average margin for 2022. The margin compression was largely attributable to the shifting of the deposit mix towards interest-bearing accounts and away from non-interest-bearing accounts.\n\nSEC Filings\n\nGoing forward, I\u2019m expecting the deposit migration to pause because I\u2019m anticipating interest rate cuts, which will reduce the attractiveness of interest-bearing accounts relative to non-interest-bearing accounts. As a result, I\u2019m expecting the pressure on the margin to wane.\n\nHolding the balance sheet constant, the anticipated interest rate cuts will have a negligible direct impact on the margin. This is because of the characteristics of loans and deposits, which make the balance sheet slightly liability-sensitive. The results of the management\u2019s rate-sensitivity analysis given in the 10-K filing show that a 100-basis point rate cut could reduce the net interest income by just 0.07% over twelve months.\n\n2023 10-K Filing\n\nConsidering the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest projections, I\u2019m anticipating a 25-basis points rate cut later this year, and 100-basis points rate cuts in 2025. Based on my interest-rate outlook and the balance sheet\u2019s rate sensitivity, I\u2019m expecting the margin to remain mostly unchanged through the end of 2025.\n\nExpecting Loan Growth Improvement\n\nFlushing Financial Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio declined by 1.2% during the first quarter, after dipping by 0.4% in 2023. I\u2019m not too worried because the portfolio has declined in the first quarters of the last two years as well and then recovered in the remainder of the year. Therefore, the first quarter\u2019s decline appears to be more seasonal than the part of a negative trend.\n\nThe company operates in the New York City Boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, and in Nassau and Suffolk County, New York. As shown below, the gap between the unemployment rate of New York City and the national average unemployment rate has significantly declined over the last few months.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nMoreover, economic activity in the state of New York appears to have improved this year, as can be deciphered from the slope of the coincident economic activity index shown below.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAs a result, I\u2019m confident that loan growth can improve in the last three quarters of 2024. I\u2019m estimating the loan portfolio to have grown by 0.75% in the second quarter of this year. Further, I\u2019m expecting the portfolio to grow by 0.75% every quarter till the end of 2025. Moreover, I\u2019m expecting other balance sheet items to grow in line with loans. The following table shows my balance sheet estimates.\n\nFinancial Position FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24E FY25E Net Loans 5,750 6,660 6,601 6,894 6,867 6,935 7,145 Growth of Net Loans 4.0% 15.8% (0.9)% 4.4% (0.4)% 1.0% 3.0% Other Earning Assets 831 706 835 809 948 1,277 1,316 Deposits 5,022 6,091 6,334 6,437 6,765 7,334 7,556 Borrowings and Sub-Debt 1,237 1,021 816 1,147 841 687 708 Common equity 580 619 680 677 670 670 674 Book Value Per Share ($) 20.2 21.1 21.5 22.3 22.6 22.5 22.6 Tangible BVPS ($) 19.6 20.4 20.9 21.6 21.9 21.9 22.0 Source: SEC Filings, Author's Estimates(In USD million unless otherwise specified) Click to enlarge\n\nExpecting Earnings to Improve from the First Quarter\u2019s Level\n\nAfter plunging in the first quarter of 2024, I\u2019m expecting earnings to recover in the remainder of the year on the back of loan growth. Meanwhile, the margin will likely remain stable. Further, I\u2019m making the following assumptions:\n\nI\u2019m expecting the provisioning expense for loan losses to continue at the first quarter\u2019s level through the end of 2025. I\u2019m assuming non-interest income will grow at a low and conservative rate of 0.5% every quarter till the end of next year. I\u2019m expecting the efficiency ratio (calculated as non-interest expenses divided by total revenue) to gradually improve and return to the 2023 level over the next year and a half.\n\nBased on these expectations, I\u2019m estimating earnings of $0.79 per share for 2024 and $1.01 per share for 2025. The following table shows my income statement estimates.\n\nIncome Statement FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24E FY25E Net interest income 162 195 248 244 179 172 178 Provision for loan losses 3 23 (5) 5 11 4 4 Non-interest income 9 11 4 10 23 12 13 Non-interest expense 115 138 147 144 151 150 147 Net income - Common Sh. 41 35 82 77 29 23 30 EPS - Diluted ($) 1.44 1.18 2.59 2.50 0.97 0.79 1.01 Source: SEC Filings, Earnings Releases, Author's Estimates(In USD million unless otherwise specified) Click to enlarge\n\nRisks Appear to be Low\n\nThe loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in the state of New York. This lack of geographical diversity is a source of risk. Otherwise, the company\u2019s risk level is low, as discussed below.\n\nOffice property loans made up just 3% of total loans at the end of March 2024, according to details given in the latest earnings presentation. Moreover, non-performing loans were zero percent of total office loans. Therefore, the risk from the work-from-home culture is limited. Gross unrealized losses on the Available-for-Sale securities portfolio amounted to $81.7 million at the end of March 2024, which is around just 12% of total equity book value. Uninsured and uncollateralized deposits totaled $1.2 billion at the end of March 2024, which is only 16.8% of total deposits.\n\nFFIC is Offering a Dividend Yield of 6.7%\n\nFlushing Financial Corporation is offering an attractive dividend yield of 6.7% at the current quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share and the June 28 closing market price of $13.15. However, there is a risk, albeit small, that FFIC could cut its dividend because my estimated earnings and dividend estimates imply that the payout ratio will go above 100% in 2024.\n\nNevertheless, for the purposes of this investment thesis, I\u2019m not expecting any dividend cut because I think FFIC can manage to pay a dividend that\u2019s greater than earnings in 2024. This is because the company had excess tier I capital of $388.5 million at the end of March 2024, which is much higher than the total annual dividend amount of $26 million.\n\nFurther, the implied payout ratio will fall to 87.6% in 2025, which is better than the payout ratio of 91% for 2023. Therefore, I think FFIC is likely to ride out 2024 without cutting its dividend because the earnings outlook is positive.\n\nAdopting a Buy Rating\n\nI\u2019m using the historical price-to-tangible book (\u201cP/TB\u201d) and price-to-earnings (\u201cP/E\u201d) multiples to value Flushing Financial Corporation. The stock has traded at an average P/TB ratio of 0.90x in the past, as shown below.\n\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 Average T.

The first part of the quarter saw a continual rise in overall yields that started at the beginning of the year. In other words, a reversion of the bond market rally that was the hallmark of the fourth quarter last year. The ten-year US Treasury (US10Y) rose from 3.88% at the start of the year to hit 4.70% on April 25th. What were the causes? More fear of the Fed \u2013 \u201chigher for longer\u201d \u2013 and this was buttressed by some strong job numbers early in the year, continuing low jobless claims, and some upward surprises on the monthly inflation front. All of these conspired to have investors move their expectations out longer for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates.\n\nTowards the end of April we started to get some more bond-friendly data. Some softer job numbers, some increases in initial jobless claims, and better news on the inflation front \u2013 particularly the May inflation data, which showed 0% monthly growth in CPI and a negative adjustment to PPI. There was also a slowdown in both new and existing home sales as well as an increase in credit card delinquencies. All of these developments can be partially attributed to the higher level of short-term interest rates. Since then, yields have declined, with the ten-year yield moving back to the 4.30% range \u2013 a drop of 40 basis points. At this point we are still 70 basis points lower than the peak of last October in yields but 40 basis points higher than year end.\n\nMunicipal bond yields increased more than Treasury yields during the quarter. Some of this is reversing the strong relative municipal bond performance during the first quarter of 2024. We think the municipal performance earlier in the year was a combination of investors perceiving a change in tax policy coming out of November\u2019s election along with some fading of Treasuries based on the deficit, Congressional disagreements, and the high percentage of government debt in relation to GDP.\n\nThe charts below show the changes in the US Treasury and the AAA municipal yield curves since the end of the year, end of the first quarter, the peak in yields in April, and now. We can see the yield ratio changes and the fact that, at the margin, the tax free muni market has become more attractive in the last two months. Municipal bond supply is running approximately above 30% ahead of last year and will probably end up the year in the $450\u2013470 billion range. And more infrastructure spending is ahead of us.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nWhat are we doing and why are we doing it?\n\nWe are keeping duration in the 6.25\u20136.5-year range on total return tax-free accounts. This is in line where we were after the beginning of the year, when we reined in duration a touch to reflect the large rally in bonds in the fourth quarter. We are being careful on general-obligation debt from big cities. Why? We still feel that there is an adjustment coming in the office real estate arena. This has implications for regional banks but also property taxes, as many of these buildings\u2019 owners will be appealing their current level of property taxes.\n\nWe do feel the economy is slowing down at the margin; and while the Federal Reserve has continued to emphasize continuity in the present level of short-term rates, we would not be surprised to see the Fed do one rate cut in September to try and avoid having to do anything at their November meeting, right before the presidential election. If the economy shows further signs of softening, they would have the December meeting to apply another rate cut.\n\nAnd finally, the yield curves (both Treasury and tax-free muni) are still inverted. The negative Treasury yield curve (three months to ten years) is now in its 17th month. As we have pointed out before, this has always happened in front of an economic slowdown, and this is a long time to have a negative yield curve. But Covid has stretched most economic activity, and the growth of private credit has filled in in areas where regional banks have pulled back.\n\nWe hope everybody enjoys the July 4th week. Happy Independence Day!\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

        "body": "Sinenkiy\n\nBy Brian Levitt, Global Market Strategist\n\nHistory is composed of challenging times. As a global market strategist, my job is to talk about military conflicts and other historic events in the context of stock markets, and to offer some perspective for investors. With that in mind, it's important to remember that, over more than 120 years, markets have experienced long-term growth despite war, recession, oil shocks, political assassinations, and much more.\n\nWhile military conflicts test investors' resolve to stick to their investment plan, history suggests these events have not derailed the long-term growth of financial markets. I implore investors to maintain a long-term perspective.\n\nStock market returns following geopolitical conflicts\n\nIf there's a factor that impacts market performance, there's an index to measure it. Geopolitical risk is no exception. The chart below illustrates 11 points in history where we experienced a peak in the Geopolitical Risk Index, and it shows the return of the S&P 500 Index 12 months after that peak. In most cases, the stock market rose significantly in the year following peak geopolitical risk.\n\nStocks have made significant returns in the 12 months following peak geopolitical risk\n\nS&P 500 Index returns 12 months after a peak in the Geopolitical Risk Index\n\nSources: Bloomberg and Economic Policy Uncertainty, Oct. 15, 2023. Most recent data available. The Geopolitical Risk Index is based on the number of articles related to adverse geopolitical events in 10 different newspapers. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Click to enlarge\n\nThree things for long-term investors to focus on\n\nWhile military conflicts understandably generate concerns about the potential market impact, I believe long-term investors should focus on three questions:\n\n1. What's the outlook for the economy?\n\nUltimately, I believe investors should stay focused on the businesses that are going to harness innovations such as artificial intelligence and robotics, develop treatments for debilitating diseases, evolve the nation's energy sources, and invent new technologies and industries that aren't even on the radar. History suggests that innovations - and investment opportunities - will continue irrespective geopolitical difficulties.\n\n2. What's the expected path of Federal Reserve monetary policy?\n\nFor all the focus on geopolitics, I'd argue that monetary policy matters more. The old adage holds true: Don't fight the Fed. Historically, the economy has been hurt or helped by monetary policy conditions.\n\n3. Does this military conflict change the answer to either of those questions?\n\nTypically, the answer is no, so long as the conflict remains contained or regional. And that can run counter to what some investors might expect. Consider this example: The MSCI Poland Index has been one of the world's best-performing indices since Russia invaded Ukraine, climbing 54.15% from the day of the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, through May 2024.1 That's not an outcome many investors might have expected in the earlier days of the conflict.\n\nStick to long-term investing plans\n\nWhile unnerving, geopolitical conflicts shouldn't change investors' long-term investment plans, in my view. History has shown that other factors - economic growth, business innovation, and monetary policy - drive the path of the markets.\n\nFootnotes 1Source: Bloomberg L.P., as of May 31, 2024.

        "title": "Realty Income: Still A Reason To Be Bullish (NYSE:O)",
        "body": "Maxxa_Satori\n\nThe world of REITs is vast, with all sorts and sizes of companies for investors to choose from. One of the biggest players out there, however, is undoubtedly Realty Income (NYSE:O), a diverse REIT with assets that cater to grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, restaurants, health and fitness centers, automotive service companies, and more. About 79.6% of the company's annualized contractual rent is dedicated to the retail space. However, the company also has exposure to the industrial space, as well as gaming. Most of the firm\u2019s revenue comes from The US market. But it is truly diverse from a geographical perspective, with 11.1% of annualized contractual rent, for instance, coming from the UK.\n\nThe last article that I wrote about Realty Income was published in the middle of March of this year. At that time, I pointed out the multi-trillion dollar opportunity that existed for investors. To be precise, the total addressable market for the US alone for the business was estimated to be worth about $5.4 trillion. And in Europe, the opportunity is about $8.5 trillion. In that article, I acknowledged that shares were not exactly the cheapest. But they were priced similar to other comparable enterprises, and the high quality of the company justified a \u2018buy\u2019 rating. Given the time that has passed, as well as some new developments that popped up, I think it's only appropriate to revisit the picture. And what I found confirms that I was not wrong in my prior assessment of the business, even though shares have marginally underperformed the broader market since the publication of that article.\n\nThings are looking good\n\nFundamentally speaking, things are going really well for Realty Income and its investors. Revenue in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, for instance, came in at $1.26 billion. That's 33.5% higher than the $944.4 million reported one year earlier. A small portion of this growth came from same store rental revenue growth that was driven by rent escalators that the company has, as well as by new lease contracts being signed by customers. Foreign currency fluctuations also helped slightly. But the largest contributor to the $316.1 million year-over-year growth in revenue for the company, by far, was a $265.7 million increase caused by properties acquired during 2023 and 2024. This included the properties that the company acquired in early January of this year when the business completed its merger with Spirit Realty Capital in a move that brought to the business 2,018 additional properties.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nWith revenue rising, profitability metrics for the business also improved. Operating cash flow, as an example, increased from $731.2 million to $778.7 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, the increase was even more significant, from $650.7 million to $785.4 million. There are, of course, other profitability metrics to pay attention to. One of these is FFO, or funds from operations. This metric increased from $684.3 million to $785.7 million. The adjusted figure for this grew even more, from $650.7 million to $862.9 million. And lastly, EBITDA for the business expanded from $843.6 million to $1.15 billion.\n\nSo far, things are going really well for investors. This is evidenced by a couple of factors. For starters, in May of this year, the company announced that it was increasing its common stock dividend by 2.1%. This was followed up by another modest increase in the firm's dividend in June of this year. This marked the 126th dividend increase since the company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It's also the fourth dividend increase that the company has seen this year, and it marked the 648th consecutive monthly dividend throughout the company's 55-year operating history.\n\nRealty Income\n\nAs great as this is to see, it pales in comparison to management's announcement on June 4th of this year that the company is increasing guidance for 2024. There are many working parts to this guidance, so instead of detailing out each one, I would refer you to the image above. It shows prior guidance compared to the revised guidance that we should rely on now. Most notably, adjusted FFO per share should now come in between $4.15 and $4.21. At the midpoint, that's a bit higher than the $4.17 previously anticipated. Even more significant, to me, is the fact that the company announced plans to spend $3 billion on investment opportunities this year. That's 50% higher than the $2 billion management was previously expecting. And none of this includes the aforementioned merger that occurred in January.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nIf we assume the company's share count does not change from where it is right now, then the increase in guidance should result in adjusted FFO of about $3.49 billion. FFO should be around $3.57 billion if this is the case. If we assume that other profitability metrics should rise at the same rate, this would translate to adjusted operating cash flow of about $3.50 billion and EBITDA of approximately $4.55 billion. In the table above, you can see these figures and how they compare against results seen for 2023.\n\nAuthor - SEC EDGAR Data\n\nWith this data taken into consideration, I then decided to value the stock. This can be seen in the chart above. As you can see, the stock looks much more attractive on a forward basis than if we were to use 2023 figures. But in all fairness, this is more of an apples to oranges comparison since the 2023 figures do not factor in any cash flows from the aforementioned merger. As part of my analysis, I then decided to compare Realty Income to five similar firms, as shown in the table below. I did this using only two of the four valuation metrics so that I could minimize complexity. On a price to operating cash flow basis, three of the five companies were cheaper than Realty Income. But when it comes down to the EV to EBITDA approach, this number drops to two of the five.\n\nCompany Price / Operating Cash Flow EV / EBITDA Realty Income 13.0 15.5 Simon Property Group (SPG) 12.9 13.7 Kimco Realty (KIM) 12.9 16.8 Regency Centers (REG) 15.0 17.2 Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) 14.9 17.5 NNN REIT (NNN) 12.2 14.9 Click to enlarge\n\nTakeaway\n\nAs things stand, Realty Income does look to be more or less fairly valued compared to similar enterprises. But this doesn't mean that investors shouldn't be bullish. Management continues to make big investments focused on the future and, for such a high-quality company, its trading multiples are not unrealistic. Management seems very bullish, as evidenced by the continued dividend increases and the uptick in guidance. The big investments being made this year should do well to further create value for investors down the road. Given these factors, I do not think that rating the company a \u2018buy\u2019 was a bad decision. Rather, I suspect that the company will just need additional time to realize the upside it should enjoy.",

        "title": "Micron: Short Term Sell Signal, But Long Term Buy Signal (Technical Analysis) (NASDAQ:MU)",
        "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) just dropped after reporting earnings, and we think this will trigger our buy-on-weakness signals because it has our proprietary Stocks In Demand or SID Buy Signal and is already in our 2024MP Model Portfolio. The charts below show the short-term Sell signal on the daily chart and the longer-term Buy signal on the weekly chart.\n\nMU is outperforming the Index on a trend basis, shown on our weekly chart below, and portfolio managers love that. We expect them to add to their positions on any pullback like this post earnings one. That is what happened last time.\n\nWe have identified support levels on the daily chart. Let\u2019s see which one is the bottom to buy on weakness. We will see it on the chart when portfolio managers start buying it again at lower prices. If they do not return to buy on weakness, that would be a bearish signal.\n\nWe like to check with SA analysts and Quant scores to do our due diligence on our own Buy signal for MU and whether we should continue to hold it in our Model Portfolio. For the five SA analysts writing after MU earnings, three had Buy ratings and two analysts had Hold ratings. The consensus for all the SA analysts is a Buy rating, and the latest analysts are pointing to a Hold or a Buy. Therefore, we would continue to hold it in our portfolio.\n\nThe SA Quant rating is also a Hold, so this also would confirm our decision to Hold. These ratings show top grades for Growth, Momentum, Revisions and Profitability. However, MU gets an F for Valuation, and therein lies the problem. That is why price is pulling back after earnings. When Valuation becomes acceptable to portfolio managers, they will start buying on weakness again, as they have in the past with MU. We don't guess when that will happen. We just watch the charts to know when it happens. We will, of course, let you know.\n\nSA is also reporting that the consensus Wall St. analysts' rating is a Strong Buy. This agrees with our own, proprietary Strong Buy signal shown at the top of the weekly chart below. It is possible that some of these analysts may drop to a Hold signal after MU earnings, but that may only take the consensus down from a Strong Buy to a Buy rating. These analysts are strictly fundamentalists and change their ratings when stocks are extremely overvalued. We will keep an eye on SA's tracking of these analysts now that earnings are out.\n\nHere is the daily chart showing the short-term Sell signals on the chart and the drop in price, looking for a support level that will hold for the bounce back up:\n\nMU short term sell signals on the daily chart. (stockcharts.com)\n\nAt the top of the above chart you can see the big, reversal day, Sell signal confirmed by high volume, higher than the last pullback in price. Thus, we expect the first support level to fail. Price is dropping to test the 50-day moving average uptrend, as it did last time. Price has already broken below the first support level at $133.\n\nBelow price is Chaikin Money Flow and you can see this dropping sharply, which is a Sell signal. Below that is the MACD signal, and you can see the crossover of the black line below the red line, which is a Sell signal. Next is Relative Strength, relative to the Index, and you can see it breaking down and under-performing the Index on a short-term basis. That's bearish short term.\n\nNext is the most important signal for us because we use it to draw our vertical, red line Sell signal on the daily chart. This is the Full Stochastic signal. Finally, at the bottom of the chart is the ADX signal, and you can see the crossover of Supply over Demand as Supply on balance takes price lower.\n\nWhen will the buying start? When we see all these signals improving, and we change that red line Sell signal to a blue line Buy signal. We will keep you posted. Let's move on to the longer-term Buy signal that is still in place but under attack.\n\nHere is the longer term, weekly chart, with our strong Buy signal shown at the top of this chart:\n\nMU weekly chart showing Buy signals under attack. (stockcharts.com)\n\nNot only does the above weekly chart have our own Buy signal at the top, but it also still has our blue, vertical line, technical Buy signal triggered by the Full Stochastic. However, it is under attack. Notice that on the last pullback it triggered a red line, technical Sell signal. But at the top of the chart, you will see that the technical Sell signal had no effect on our own Buy signal. That is because our Buy signal at the top of the chart uses both technicals and fundamentals.\n\nAlso notice at the bottom of the chart that on the last pullback in price, ADX Demand dropped but remained in control. The same is happening so far with this pullback. If there is any change in the ADX signal or our own proprietary Buy signal, we will let you know. Otherwise, our buy on weakness signal will continue, and we will expect to see the buyers come in to change the current Sell signals.",

        "title": "AVES: A Promising Active Emerging Markets Fund That's Been Working (NYSEARCA:AVES)",
        "body": "tum3123\n\nEmerging markets have been very challenging for well over a decade. Passive broad-based indices have gone sideways as US markets pushed higher and higher. A large part of the weakness in the broad based emerging market proxies is due to China, which of course begs the question of whether active management, seeing that tactically, can outperform. I do think there's a strong case to be made in general for active management when it comes to emerging market stocks, and if you agree, then you may want to consider the Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (NYSEARCA:AVES).\n\nThe fund doesn't have a long track record, having launched in 2021. It's an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks capital appreciation from a globally diversified portfolio of value equities across emerging markets. AVES has an expense ratio of 0.36%, and so far, very promising results.\n\nA Look Into The Holdings\n\nThe core of AVES' stock selection process involves selecting stocks with lower valuations and higher profitability ratios. This tactic is predicated on the idea that such stocks are not fully appreciated (in the investment sense of the word) by the market, as current prices can often deviate from a company's fundamental, intrinsic value.\n\nThe fund has 1,600 holdings, and skews more in the mid-cap range with an average weighted market cap of nearly $8 billion. No position makes up more than 1.09% of the fund, making it highly diversified.\n\navantisinvestors.com\n\nWhat do some of these companies do? Larsen + Toubro Ltd is an Indian multinational conglomerate with operations spanning construction, manufacturing and technology. Kia Corp is a prominent South Korean automobile manufacturer known for its smart and value-conscious line of automobiles. CTBC Financial Holding Co Ltd is a provider of financial services in Taiwan, offering bank, securities and insurance businesses. And Hyundai Motor is a leading South Korean automobile manufacturer and the second-largest overall supplier of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.\n\nThese top holdings serve as a representation of AVES's consistently value-oriented approach, with businesses having good profitability characteristics, spanning multiple industries and geographies across the emerging markets investment universe.\n\nSector Composition and Weightings\n\nFrom a sector allocation perspective, I think the top 4 being so close in weighting is interesting.\n\navantisinvestors.com\n\nTech makes up the largest allocation at 14.295, but not in an outsized way given Consumer Discretionary at 13.44%, Materials at 13.2%, and Industrials at 12.53%. Here are clear sector bets as an outcome of the stock select process, reflecting how the active management decisions look in aggregate.\n\nFrom a country allocation perspective, China, India, and Taiwan are all neck and neck. I like this given that most passive emerging market indices have a large outsized weighting in China relative to other emerging economies.\n\navantisinvestors.com\n\nPeer Comparison\n\nSince this is active, let's compare AVES to the passive iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which candidly has been a heartache trade as it's gone nowhere for a long, long time. When we look at the price ratio of AVES to EEM, we find that AVES has handily outperformed. The active management has clearly worked.\n\nstockcharts.com\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in AVES\n\nOn the positive side, AVES provides a fundamentally driven basket of value stocks in developing markets, taking advantage of their earnings growth while mitigating valuation risk. Its active management combined with deep focus on profitability- and value-related gauges should help it find undervalued stocks that broad passive index-following vehicles might miss. Additionally, as AVES is very well-diversified across sectors, countries and individual holdings, concentration risks is minimized. Investors can thus benefit from a diversified exposure to the potential of emerging markets.\n\nThe downside? Remember that emerging markets tend to have tumultuous geopolitics, uncertain regulatory environments, and currency swings that could impact the fund's holdings. Also, the fund has a pretty heavy focus on China and Taiwan. This means that things that happen in that part of the world - be it intensifying tensions, or changes to policy to inhibit business - can hurt AVES's performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you're looking to gain exposure to emerging markets, the Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF is one of the best ways out there to target undervalued companies with both good profits and high quality. By owning AVES, you can leverage emerging economies' growth potential while hopefully outperforming broad-based indices. Broadly speaking, I do think emerging markets are due for continuous outperformance in the next cycle, and that tailwind will likely only benefit AVES. AVES is therefore worth considering.",

        "title": "CII: Attractive Total Returns, Attractive Distribution, Trading At A Discount (NYSE:CII)",
        "body": "PM Images\n\nWritten by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist.\n\nBlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund (NYSE:CII) is a closed-end fund providing exposure to a portfolio of large-cap equity holdings. The fund's benchmark is the Russell 1000 Index, which, similar to the S&P 500 Index, is heavily tilted towards tech and the Super Six mega-cap growth names. The fund then has a covered call strategy to help generate a steady monthly distribution to investors.\n\nWe last covered the fund earlier this year, and it continues to trade at an attractive discount. In fact, the discount has changed little since our prior update. Though there has been a bit of volatility since our prior update, that was during a brief pullback in April. Since then, the broader market and this fund have once again been pushing higher as it bounced rather quickly off those lows.\n\nCII Performance Since Prior Update (Seeking Alpha)\n\nCII Basics\n\n1-Year Z-score: -1.00\n\nDiscount: -7.23%\n\nDistribution Yield: 6.04%\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.89%\n\nLeverage: N/A\n\nManaged Assets: $940.7 million\n\nStructure: Perpetual\n\nCII has a simple objective and strategy; it \"seeks to provide investors with a combination of current income and capital appreciation\" by \"investing in a portfolio of equity securities of the U.S. and foreign issuers.\" They will also \"employ a strategy of writing call and put options.\"\n\nDiscount Continues To Look Appealing\n\nDespite the fund's similar top holdings to the S&P 500 Index, as we could see above, the fund's performance had lagged a bit in terms of total returns. That isn't unusual for a covered call writing fund, as covered calls can cap upside. We've also been in a really low volatility period, so options premiums that can be received tend to be reduced in general. Like all investments, there are pros and cons when it comes to making investment choices.\n\nCovered calls might cap some upside in a rapidly rising market, but the trade-off is receiving some premiums to fund the distribution to shareholders. It also means that even in a flat market, there could be some gains, and it is also a slightly defensive strategy. That is, if the market is moving sideways or even slightly lower, the fund's returns could be positive due to receiving the premium from writing calls.\n\nThe annualized returns provided below are a bit dated, as they are from the fund's last annual report for the period ended December 31, 2024. That said, it is the table that provides total returns against the fund's benchmarks. In this case, the fund has put up respectable returns against the Russell 1000 Index and even better returns against the MSCI USA Call Overwrite Index in the last five-year annualized period.\n\nCII Performance Vs. Benchmarks (BlackRock)\n\nSo, for the most part, CII has not given up too much in terms of upside against its benchmark despite the covered call strategy. One of the reasons for this is that CII is an actively managed fund that can adjust the overwrite percentage that they are writing. The latest shows that they were overwritten by nearly 50%. That would put them in a more defensive position relative to their target range of between 30 and 40%. That could indicate the management team is a bit more bearish here.\n\nThough, admittedly, they have been overwritten by about 50-55% for our last several updates now.\n\n53.89% of the portfolio was overwritten at the end of January 2024, which was down just a bit from 55.5% in our prior update. This puts them on a more defensive tilt and above their target, given the target overwrites of the fund is between 30-40%.\n\nWhat makes CII a bit more compelling here as well is the fund's discount. The last time we covered the fund, it was attractive at that time, too, and it hasn't moved much since. This could be that investors are anticipating that we are nearing a top in the overall market, so CII trading at a discount is just reflecting that. For me, I don't try to time the market, as I know my limitations. The market can run for years higher and higher. What I can control, is buying when a CEF is literally telling us that it is worth more than what its share price currently reflects.\n\nYcharts\n\nCII seems to be going in the opposite direction of all CEFs as well. CEF discounts have been narrowing, in general. The average CEF discount as of June 13, 2024 came to -6.48%. That narrowed from the -7.83% level it was earlier in the year on February 13, 2024. It is also narrowed more materially from the -9.56% seen on the last trading day of 2023.\n\nWith that said, this discount also opened up the way we like, which is to say that it was the fund's underlying portfolio as measured by its total NAV return that was outpacing its total share price results.\n\nYcharts\n\nAnother factor to consider with CII now is that it was included as one of the BlackRock closed-end funds that have adopted the discount management program. Over the next year, should the fund trade at an average discount wider than 7.5% during four measurement periods, the fund will conduct a tender offer for 2.5% of outstanding shares at 98%.\n\nMeasurement Periods For Tender Offer Triggers (BlackRock)\n\nThat might not be huge, but that could be up to 10% of shares repurchased over the next year. Some investors will also likely not participate, so the minimum tendered shares will be 2.5%. Given the small amounts, that might make some investors feel it isn't worth it, and that could lead to an even larger than usual amount being tendered for those that do participate.\n\nOnly time will tell, but either way, it is a positive for investors-even if only a small positive. This deal was struck with Karpus, but clearly, in the back of their mind, it was also a move to try to thwart Saba's activist pressures on BlackRock's other funds. CII isn't a target of Saba's, but it is seemingly an indirect beneficiary.\n\nSteady Distribution\n\nThanks to steady total returns for this fund, it has been able to deliver a steady monthly distribution to investors for the most part over the last decade. There were a couple of cuts following the Global Financial Crisis, then a smaller one in 2016. However, since then, it has only been maintained or increased.\n\nCII Distribution History (CEFConnect)\n\nThe distribution yield on this name comes to about 6%. That certainly isn't the highest in the CEF space, and in fact, it is quite low for a CEF. The NAV rate comes to 5.60%, so this fund could be due for an increased distribution.\n\nAlternatively, they could choose to maintain the current rate-which is still significantly higher than something like the S&P 500 Index's yield-and choose to pay out larger year-end specials. In my opinion, I think that might be the more prudent move as the current distribution provides more flexibility in terms of if we are at a market top and we get into a serious correction. They don't look like they'd be in a position where they'd have to cut the regular even in the event of a market crash due to the modest distribution rate.\n\nIn terms of distribution coverage, we discussed their annual report previously, and we have no additional updates on that front.\n\nNII coverage for CII's distribution comes to 5.45%. That's up from the prior year, but that's because CII paid out a large special in 2022, which saw more paid out as distributions to shareholders. CII Annual Report (BlackRock) Of course, one of the ways the fund can generate those capital gains that it needs is through writing covered calls. That doesn't always work out as expected, though, and sometimes option writing can create losses. For 2023 being such a strong year, it's something we've seen from a number of option writing funds - that is, the options written are showing realized losses. That was the case for CII, which saw their options generate about $11 million in losses for the fund. Offsetting those losses were realized gains from the underlying portfolio that were way more than enough to offset those losses. CII Unrealized/Realized Gains/Losses (BlackRock) One of the main reasons that the options can generate a loss is because the managers are closing or rolling the positions for a loss. This would be to participate in further upside on a position if they believe it has more room to run.\n\nThe only thing worth adding is that thanks to strong performance this year, the fund's NAV has increased. Therefore, as an equity CEF, the fund has been 'covering' its distribution on that measurement.\n\nCII's Portfolio\n\nDespite the fund's benchmark being the Russell 1000 Index, the fund does not carry nearly that many positions. They actually carry a rather small number of holdings, relatively speaking, at 53 at the end of May 31, 2024. Of those 53, the top ten comprise over 41.5% of the portfolio. Breaking it down even further, the Super Six names, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META), are nearly 32% of the fund.\n\nCII Top Ten Holdings (BlackRock)\n\nSo, these names have been working and driving most of the overall equity market results we've been seeing in the U.S. However, that does make this fund quite concentrated overall, which is worth considering if one is looking for more diversification. It needs these names to continue to perform in order for CII to perform as well, but frankly, that then also means so does the entire 'market' these days.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index, as measured by SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), has its top ten holdings comprising nearly 36% of the fund. The Super Six there make up 31.2% of the fund, which is perhaps no coincidence that CII's weighting is nearly identical.\n\nSPY Top Ten Holdings (Seeking Alpha)\n\nConclusion\n\nCII has provided investors with solid total returns historically and a healthy monthly distribution. The future can't be predicted based on past performance, but it should generally trend toward similar performance to the broader market. So, if one is optimistic about the long-term prospects of the market, then CII could be an interesting choice for those investors who also seek a monthly distribution. CII's discount also provides a more appealing time to consider this fund currently as well.",

        "title": "Realty Income: Dividend Keeps Growing (NYSE:O)",
        "body": "JARAMA\n\nIntroduction\n\nI had a 'Strong buy' thesis for Realty Income's (NYSE:O) stock in March. The stock returned 1.6% to investors since March 26, including its monthly dividend. There were monthly dividend hikes in June and May, underscoring the reliability of payouts. Management is quite confident in this year's performance as it recently boosted both earnings guidance for 2024 and announced a very aggressive expected increase in investments this year. Realty Income's prudent underwriting approach is still in place, meaning that risks from the company's perspective are quite low. Experts believe that the retail commercial property market is in excellent shape and O is one of the primary benefits of the industry's strength. There is a 19% undervaluation and forward dividend yield is close to 6%, which makes me reiterate my \"Strong Buy\" rating.\n\nFundamental analysis\n\nThe major reason why I remain bullish about Realty Income is consistency of its dividends. The company raised its monthly dividend again on June 11 to $0.263 per share. There were dividend increases announced in May. The forward dividend yield is approximately 6% as of now. The trend is quite inspiring, and the management looks confident in O's bright near-term future. There was a boost to the lower end of O's FY2024 earnings guidance, and the management also increased its 2024 investment volumes expectations by massive 50%, from $2 billion to around $3 billion.\n\nThe management's very prudent approach to selecting new properties to drive growth is one of the company's major strengths. The total amount of sourced potential acquisition targets was $9.3 billion YTD 2024. Out of them, the actual investment volume was $0.6 billion in Q1 2024. The process of selecting new assets is rigorous and no changes are expected to happen with O's prudent underwriting approach. Therefore, we can expect that O's occupancy rates will stay close to 100%.\n\nO's presentation\n\nDespite the broader real estate industry experiencing headwinds due to the tight monetary environment, it looks that O's segment of retail real estate is in good shape. According to Cushman & Wakefield's (CWK), the demand for retail real estate is strong partly due to a robust pipeline of store openings by large retailer. As one of the U.S. largest retail REITs O is poised to benefit from the favorable trends in the segment.\n\nThe company has been expanding internationally in the last few years, and Europe is the main destination. Some good news is coming from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, as the European Central Bank ('ECB') started cutting interest rates earlier this month. There might be two more rate cuts this year, which will be quite beneficial for the European real estate industry. O has been historically strong in absorbing industry tailwinds, and positive developments in Europe are likely good for shareholders.\n\nThe fact that the Fed's last rate hike took place eleven months ago, in July 2023, means that currently interest rates are highly likely at peak levels, and they will go downward. But the timing and pace of rate cuts are still two big questions which can make the market nervous. Nevertheless, as O is mostly concentrated on retail real estate it is better to look a bit narrower at macro factors.\n\nRetail industry significantly depends on the financial health of the U.S. consumers. Despite a tight monetary policy, the U.S. unemployment rate is still close to historical minimums at 4%. Real wages demonstrate modest growth, which also contributes to the health of American consumers. Moreover, the U.S. household wealth levels continue breaking records in 2024.\n\nSA\n\nO's fundamental strength is reflected in EPS projections for the next several quarters. FFO is expected to demonstrate consistent modest growth, which is good for dividend investors. With the management's consistently prudent approach and industry tailwinds, I think that the projected EPS growth is reasonable.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nMy previous valuation method for O was the dividend discount model ('DDM'), which needs assumptions to be updated to recalculate the fair value of the stock. The discount rate is 8%, a softer one compared to the previous 8.3% rate. I am more dovish in terms of the discount rate because the Fed plans to start cutting rates by the end of this year. Current dividend is $3.12, an estimate of Wall Street analysts for FY 2025. Growth rate remains the same as in my previous DDM, conservative at 3%. The fair value of the stock is $62.4, higher than the previous $57.7 estimate. Reasons for the upgrade are expected to improve monetary conditions (lower discount rate) and the upgrade to the current year's dividend from $3.06 to $3.12 from consensus. The current share price is 19% lower than the fair value.\n\nCalculated by the author\n\nLooking at a REIT's Price to FFO ratios also helps in understanding valuation fairness. Forward P/AFFO ratio is 14.5% lower than O's prior five years' average, which aligns with the upside potential determined by the DDM. I find the valuation attractive based on two approaches: the DDM and ratios analysis.\n\nSA\n\nMitigating factors\n\nThe uncertainty around interest rates is a headwind for all REITs including, Realty Income. Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for the company, which adversely affects the ability of the business to expand faster. Monetary policy is cyclical, and the pivot to a looser interest rates environment is inevitable sooner or later. However, the high level of uncertainty around the timing of the pivot highly likely distracts the management in making strategically important decisions.\n\nWhen O released its previous quarterly results, the company failed to deliver the EPS at least in line with consensus estimates. Missing consensus estimates is rarely a good sign and undermines investors' trust in the stock. The deep discount for the stock price is also explained by the underperformance in the past quarter's results, and if Realty Income fails to deliver a positive surprise for the next quarter, the discount might deepen.\n\nWhen big tech stocks continue beating their all-time highs several times this year, the market is likely much more interested in growth stocks. The stellar Q1 performance of the largest growth companies means that the show is likely to go on, which means lower demand for dividend stocks like O.\n\nConclusion\n\nRealty Income's approach to underwriting at acquisitions remains the same and prudent, meaning that high occupancy rates will persist. Despite high interest rates, the retail commercial property market is healthy, and O is poised to benefit from it. The valuation and forward dividend yield are very attractive, which means that O remains a 'Strong Buy', in my opinion.",

        "title": "NXP Semiconductors Stock: Near-Term Uncertainty (NASDAQ:NXPI)",
        "body": "sasha85ru/iStock via Getty Images\n\n\u201cNo place for beginners or sensitive hearts / When sentiment is left to chance\u201d Sade, Smooth Operator\n\nAs the high-performance logic segment of the semiconductor space continues to face challenges regarding end-user demand, inventory levels, and the timing of end-market re-acceleration, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) continues to burnish its reputation as a smooth operator with a good grasp of how to manage the cycles. NXP moved faster than most of its peers to correct inventory levels in 2023 and with healthy pricing and content wins, could outperform in the second half of 2024 despite a challenging macro outlook.\n\nNXPI shares are up about 40% since my last update, outperforming a host of peers including Texas Instruments (TXN) (up 10%), Microchip (MCHP) (up 7%), Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNY) (down 3%), onsemi (ON) (down 17%), and STMicro (STM) (down 20%). While NXPI has lagged the SOX over that period, I attribute that to NXPI\u2019s perceived lack of AI exposure (and indeed, it doesn\u2019t really have meaningful direct data center exposure).\n\nI\u2019m torn on the recommendation now. I only see about 10% upside now, and while I do think there\u2019s a credible case for ongoing outperformance in the second half, and I like the company\u2019s longer-term leverage to EV adoption and intelligent devices, I\u2019m concerned about what ongoing weakness in EV demand could do to sales growth expectations over the next few years.\n\nEngineering A Soft Landing\n\nI think NXP management deserves a lot of credit for seeing early warning signs in 2023 across many markets and adjusting inventories accordingly. The company moved faster than most to de-risk its mobile, IoT, and industrial businesses, and has been tightly managing distributor inventories (onsemi has done relatively well there too).\n\nTypically NXP and its distributors want around 2.5 months of inventory on hand. NXP has been below that for some time now, with the last few quarters in the 1.6 month range (Q1\u201924 ticked up to 1.7 months). That has helped cap the peak-to-trough revenue decline to under 10% where many comparables have seen 30% or greater declines and far larger hits to margins and profitability.\n\nNXP\u2019s landing has also been softened by factors that I think have longer legs. Pricing has held up better here, and I think that\u2019s due in part to a mix shift toward higher-value chips; NXP has a sizable presence in 32-bit microcontrollers (or MCUs), for instance, but not much exposure to 8-bit. Likewise, the company has been seeing good content growth in areas like comprehensive battery management, radar and ADAS.\n\nAutos \u2013 EV Adoption Matters A Lot, But It\u2019s Not The Only Factor\n\nThe biggest risk I see to NXP over the next couple of years is the weaker than expected pace of EV adoption, particularly among consumers in Western markets. Across battery management, motor control, and other EV systems, NXP has won a lot of high-value content with its MCUs, MPUs, sensors, controllers, and so on. If EV adoption stalls out, that\u2019s going to rob NXP of at least some of its projected growth.\n\nThere is a \u201cbut\u201d that mitigates this to some extent \u2013 weak battery electric vehicle (or BEV) adoption could lead OEMs to reconsider their plans with hybrids and bring more plug-in hybrids into the mix. That could actually be a net positive for NXP, as the company has products that address opportunities like hybrid control units and 48V systems, and it is at least plausible to me that a shift toward hybrids could be positive or net-neutral. Of course, the bigger risk is that PHEVs fare no better than BEVs and the mix is just higher toward conventional internal combustion powertrains for a longer period.\n\nAnother significant \u201cbut\u201d is that NXP is far more than an electrification play. The company is a top player for radar transceivers and ADAS components, and newer models have significantly higher content here irrespective of their powertrains. Likewise with UWB connectivity (smart access products for autos).\n\nThere\u2019s a shift underway with auto design that is seeing a significant shift toward \u201csoftware-defined\u201d vehicles where there is zonal computing that is basically run by high-performance MCUs. NXP was an early mover here, working with auto OEMs as early as 2013-2014 I believe, to start developing MCU families like the S32 and G3, the latter of which can handle even more centralized compute functions.\n\nThis shift will mean fewer MCUs overall in future models, but more value for the MCUs that are used and I think the pyramid will narrow in terms of who can supply the market \u2013 auto OEMs and suppliers currently source MCUs from multiple vendors (sometimes six or more), but not all companies are making the same investments into MCU development and companies like Microchip and Texas Instruments could find themselves on the outside.\n\nI do want to note, though, that the most recent MCU market share update from Gartner showed a significant shift in auto MCU share in 2023. Infineon gained a whopping 1,000bp of share, becoming the #1 player at nearly 29%, while Renesas (OTCPK:RNECY) and NXP fell by 610bp and 310bp, respectively. I think the Renesas shift had at least something to do with forex and inventory management, and I\u2019m sure inventory management impacted NXP, but this is something to monitor, as it seems that Infineon has really boosted its MCU business with its new AURIX line (including design wins totaling around EUR 19B).\n\nThe Outlook\n\nI do have my concerns about the health of NXP\u2019s major end-markets for the remainder of 2024. Auto demand has clearly slowed, with the S&P recently revising its outlook for auto production to negative 1% and EV penetration coming in short of expectations. NXP can offset that with content/platform wins and well-managed inventory, but it\u2019s an area to watch.\n\nCommunications and industrial demand is likewise looking pretty rough in the meantime, but NXP has controlled its inventory well, and I see near-term opportunities like RFID and medium-to-longer-term opportunities like increasing its participation in 32-bit MCUs for industrial markets and benefiting from edge AI. Given the company\u2019s strong presence in MCUs and connectivity, I think NXP has underrated/overlooked potential to benefit from AI-enabled edge devices, but this market will take years to develop.\n\nNXP did better than I expected in 2023, but it looks like that mostly just changed the timing on the adjustment I saw, as my 2024 numbers are a fair bit lower now. I\u2019m looking for a slight decline this year (about 1%), making two straight years of basically no growth, but I expect improvement in FY\u201925 and FY\u201926. I do see some risk that that 2025 recovery could get pushed in to 2026/2027 depending upon what happens with auto/EV demand, but channel inventories should be supportive as auto OEMs don\u2019t want a repeat of when they couldn\u2019t get chips at any price. Long term, I\u2019m looking for around 6% annualized growth from NXP.\n\nOn the margin side, gross margins have been remarkably stable, and I expect GMs to stay in the mid-58%\u2019s for a few more years. I expect flattish operating margin in FY\u201924 (around 35%), improving to 36% over two years. Free cash flow margin should move into the low-20%\u2019s over the next couple of years and then improve toward the mid-20%\u2019s, driving 10% FCF growth.\n\nAs far as valuation goes, NXP doesn\u2019t look that cheap on discounted cash flow, but oftentimes it\u2019s difficult to find growing semiconductor companies trading at attractive DCF-based fair values (it typically requires either a major downturn/investor pessimism or really low discount rates). I also favor a margin-driven EV/revenue and EV/EBITDA approach, and those lead me to multiples of 5.95x and 14.85x respectively and a fair value in the $290\u2019s.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a risk that NXP\u2019s carefully-managed downturn could be upset by even greater erosion in end-market demand, but even then I think the company is better-placed than many competitors. I also see a risk that EV sales expectations for 2024-2027 could still be too high. On the other hand, between the company\u2019s strength in areas like MCUs, its opportunities in auto electrification, edge compute, and industrial automation, I do still like the long-term outlook, and management has proven itself on execution.\n\nI may regret taking a neutral stance today, and I do still see room for the shares to move above $290, but I think the risk/return right now is just not the best. Call this a very grudging \u201chold\u201d call, as I\u2019d like the excuse to be more bullish.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The ETF got an A- for momentum. However, it got a B+ for dividends and a D- for risks.\n\nWhat Analysts Say\n\nSeeking Alpha contributor JR Research said in their June 14 report that XLE's solid \"B+\" momentum grade underscores the robustness of its buying sentiment. They added that the recent pessimism doesn't suggest a significant trend reversal into a downtrend bias. XLE's relatively attractive dividend yield of 3.3% should attract income investors as the Fed moves closer to cutting interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe energy sector's earnings growth estimates aren't falling off a cliff. The stakeholders have remained disciplined in their production capacity, helping to keep crude oil prices relatively high. As seen with the dip-buying confidence... Saudi Arabia's influence cannot be understated. The growth normalization in EVs underscores the complexities of the energy transition thesis. To bolster the energy requirements of the AI upcycle, more robust data center growth estimates will likely require the participation of all energy players. In other words, I have not assessed sufficient structural weakness in the energy sector's thesis to convince me to change my bullish assessment of its growth prospects,\u201d they said in the report.

If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on ____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: Fed\u2019s Favored Price Gauge Slows, Supporting Case for Rate Cut\n\nAlso keep in mind the presidential debate was yesterday.\n\nNKE- Earnings yesterday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. EPS $1.01 vs $.83 expected. Revenue of $12.6B vs 12.84 expected. Sales miss was attributed due to lifestyle business declining, and traffic in China declining. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Most interesting stock I\u2019m watching today.\n\nINFN- Nokia to acquire INFN in $2.3B deal to scale up their network. Note this news came out at the close yesterday.\n\nCHWY/WOOF- Spiked yesterday during the trading day due to DFV posting a picture of a dog. I wish I was joking.\n\nAMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\n\nWBTN- IPO'd yesterday, watching for any moves upward due to how it traded premarket today.\n\nIPO today: ALMS (immunosuppression therapies)",

Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by software and internet stocks.\n\nNvidia shares have been choppy after losing $430 billion in market value late last week. And, June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteoric rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. accounted for well over half of the 15% advance in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nThe trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&P 500 hit 33% last week, the highest level in about 24 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds\u2019 momentum exposure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Goldman data showed. \u201cLong concentration\u201d and \u201clong crowdedness\u201d have both seen notable declines and are at the lowest levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a potential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.\n\nThe unwind is not just hitting tech alone. Hedge funds are now tilting more defensively than usual. Their gross leverage \u2014 a measure of risk appetite \u2014 has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold regions so far in June.\n\n\u201cAfter adding risk to their portfolio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk unwinds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers,\u201d Goldman wrote in a note.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-sell-tech-stocks-095749442.html",

EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.\n\n^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.\n\nAfter at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even Zacks.com, although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they\u2019re likely to move in the same direction as the market.\n\nNow, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don\u2019t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.\n\nMoving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX\u2019s stagnancy in the same period.\n\n$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.\n\nPalantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst\u2019s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.\n\nLet\u2019s size-up against the comp.\n\nBeing in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.\n\nNonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.\n\nHowever, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won\u2019t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o\u2019 Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.\n\nThe Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.\n\nBut the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I\u2019m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.\n\nThe Set Up\n\nPlain and simple - we\u2019re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.\n\n$PLTR 1D w/ TradingView + StocksBuddy\n\nLet\u2019s see what we get out of this squad in Denver. Hope you guys enjoyed the read and found something valuable here. Per usual, NFA.\n\nSources\n\n1 2 3",

        "body": "This is the ES chart. We can see the trendlines coming all the way from 2018 local peak and the COVID-19 bottom, after which we experienced a significant bull market. We should read these trendlines as uptrend, BUT we can clearly see that the overall pattern is called an ascending channel or even a wedge since it is not broadening, nor closing. This pattern breaks to the downside over 80% of the times. Though, this frequently (since, not always) comes from a rejection from the upper trendline. Here, we can see that the most recent major level we tested was the lower trendline, which powered the price to start moving towards the upper trendline, which will act as a resistance and eventuate the pattern by starting to move towards the lower trendline, so as to break it and move lower. So, the ultimate scenario is breaking the the channel to the downside, either after we make contact with the upper trendline, or at any moment, just start moving lower. To be clear, I'm not going to take some kind of a Big Short, but being able to analyze macro trends is important in day-to-day life as well. As a sidenote, in general, we take an entry when the price closes below the trendline. So, in this case, we'd take an entry if the price was to close below the lower trendline. Though price likes to retrace back up to the lower trendline and reject from there to the downside, which usually is not a problem if the pattern is one-sided enough.",

As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the dot.com bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the dot.com boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!\n\nMAV",

        "body": "Nike has a strong dividend history and currently pays an annual dividend of $1.48 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of around 1.5%. The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and plans to continue this tradition, indicating solid financial health and sustainable growth.\n\nThe trick now, of course, is to find the right entry point into the market. I help myself with a chart on a weekly basis, which currently offers the possibility of a wolf's mouth. A wolf's mouth consists of 5 pattern points, and the lines represent the signal and target areas of the price movement. For a signal in a wolf mouth, the lower yellow line must be broken, and then the signal line must be penetrated again from bottom to top in a reversal, in our case.\n\nIn this situation, it is important to pay attention to the chart's behavior. If the price bounces off the signal line (1-3) from below, a rapid continuation of the previous short movement is to be expected. Similarly, if we penetrate the wolf, price targets up to at least the open gap or the target line (1-4) are realistic, providing a confident outlook on the potential outcomes.\n\nA harmonic pattern can be used in the chart to limit the current downward movement. In our scenario, we use a butterfly pattern. It is particularly essential to look at this in combination. Remember that the situation at the wolf trigger is crucial. We can, therefore, try to confirm this Harmonic pattern by penetrating or bouncing off the signal line of the wolf. If the butterfly pattern starts, we can use another Fibonacci from the harmonic pattern points A to D to forecast the starting points of the suspected movement.\n\nAfter the situation at the signal line of the wolf, you have to take care of a stop loss. I also use the rules of technical analysis here. I use the Elliott wave correction rule for wave 2, which states that the path of wave 2 may correct a maximum of 99.99% of the movement of wave 1.\n\nThe point of the whole scenario is to find a safe entry that can quickly the Stop Loss set to break even. Just so you know, I am an active day trader and trade very actively, which means you must maintain the trade. Likewise, I am aware that if an experienced Elliott Waver colleague sees this chart, he will point out to me that the short target after the Elliott waves is much higher. This has to do with the fact that an Elliott wave 3 has to run at least the 161 Fibonacci extension. I am aware of this, but as I said, the strategy is to find Hedgeable entries without messing up the equity and drawdown value in the account. I always care not to lose anything in my trading style, so I always break even quickly. The account grows via the trading frequency and partial sales, and when the price runs through, there is a significant and profitable rebound as the cherry on the sundae. By combining these three completely different strategies, good insights and deductions with a certain logic can be derived, which only sometimes works for me too. But it's better than shooting blindly into the air. The next step is checking various indicators. One Rule of Elliott waves is that a divergence should accompany a C correction wave. This Rule is essential because, as you already know, wave two may correct a maximum of 99.99%. Of course, we also need to ensure that the fundamental conditions for a correction are in place, which is the case here.\n\nEven if they are often dismissed as inferior, I always recommend taking a look at the moving averages. In our scenario, the picture of the moving averages in the weekly time frame is fundamentally against us. Even if you scroll back up to the previous chart, you will see that there is currently no significant divergence at the current price level.\n\nThe indicative chart, therefore, initially speaks against the structural trade setup. Still, looking at it from the perspective that we are looking for a Hedgeable entry, a retest of the moving averages can appear quite plausible. If we count back 50 candles from the blue moving average, it should rise in the near future. Consider the area of the Harmonic Butterfly Pattern between the pattern points B-C.\n\nIf we now do the same with the 200 moving average in red, we can see that it is in the falling phase, which means that the line of the 200 moving average should fall. The current strong falling candle has the appearance of a so-called Marubozu candle, which also goes against our idea. Marubozu candles do not have a significant trading range and consist only of the candle's body.\n\nYou may remember what we talked about at the beginning of this post, it was about the wolf. We need to determine how the price behaves at the signal line. In practice, after the signal line is broken, an intraday timeframe is used to refine the entry. I use a Multitimeframe principle for this, which would go beyond the scope of this article. However, if you are interested, I can write a separate article when the opportunity arises.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nTrade save and be a Tradebuddy",

I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on _____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: Fed\u2019s Favored Price Gauge Slows, Supporting Case for Rate Cut\n\nAlso keep in mind the presidential debate was yesterday.\n\nNKE- Earnings yesterday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. EPS $1.01 vs $.83 expected. Revenue of $12.6B vs 12.84 expected. Sales miss was attributed due to lifestyle business declining, and traffic in China declining. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Most interesting stock I\u2019m watching today.\n\nINFN- Nokia to acquire INFN in $2.3B deal to scale up their network. Note this news came out at the close yesterday.\n\nCHWY/WOOF- Spiked yesterday during the trading day due to DFV posting a picture of a dog. I wish I was joking.\n\nAMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\n\nWBTN- IPO'd yesterday, watching for any moves upward due to how it traded premarket today.\n\nIPO today: ALMS (immunosuppression therapies)",

U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.\n\nNow, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed \u201cuniversal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,\u201d including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.\n\nMr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.",

Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.\n\nDespite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college.

When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they\u2019d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum.

It will provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks.

His knack for capturing young viewers \u2014 first men at Fox, then women at WB \u2014 lured viewers away from the Big Three networks that had ruled television for nearly 40 years.\n\nMr. Kellner believed that ABC, NBC and CBS were ignoring viewers under 35 and were hamstrung by middle-of-the-road taste.

        "title": "A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business",
        "body": "Talking points\n\nAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.\n\nThere will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here\u2019s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate \u201cbingo card\u201d further below.)\n\nThe economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?\n\nInflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they\u2019re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 \u2014 an economy many Americans want back.\n\nTaxes: Biden\u2019s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: \u201cIt\u2019s simple math,\u201d David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don\u2019t like Biden\u2019s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.\n\nProtectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.\n\nMarkets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night\u2019s debate, \u201cmarkets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping \u201csome continuity.\u201d\n\nOther issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue \u2014 and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:\n\nFor Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.\n\nFor Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.",

        "title": "Help! Qatar Airways Denied Us Boarding Because of a Broken Link.",
        "body": "Dear Tripped Up,\n\nI am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a \u201cHealth Declaration Form\u201d in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn\u2019t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets \u2014 we received $1,185 \u2014 but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nYour run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding \u201cthousands of times a day,\u201d said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.\n\nNot to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.\n\nCountries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week\u2019s vacation.

Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.\n\nSince 2012, the Affordable Care Act has mandated that private insurance plans cover the \u201cfull range\u201d of contraceptives for women approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including female sterilizations, emergency contraceptives and any new products cleared by the F.D.A. The mandate also covers services associated with contraceptives, like counseling, insertions or removals and follow-up care.\n\nThat means that consumers shouldn\u2019t have any associated co-payments with in-network providers, even if they haven\u2019t met their deductibles. Some plans might cover only generic versions of certain contraceptives, but patients are still entitled to coverage of a specific product that their providers deem medically necessary.

        "title": "Stocks will fall 30% as the U.S. economy heads for a painful recession, strategist says",
        "body": "Wall Street has a new most apocalyptic forecast for stocks. - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto\n\nMove over, J.P. Morgan \u2014 we have a new contender for most apocalyptic stock-market forecast.\n\nIt comes courtesy of Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, who said in a report shared with MarketWatch on Thursday that he has revised down his target for the S&P 500 SPX to 3,750 \u2014 lower than J.P. Morgan Global Research\u2019s year-end target of 4,200, the previous Wall Street low \u2014 due to expectations that the U.S. will soon enter a sudden and unexpected recession. Berezin expects that recession to begin either later this year or in early 2025.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nShould that transpire, the S&P 500 could decline more than 30% from Friday\u2019s levels as a result, according to his forecast.\n\nPotentially making matters worse for markets, Berezin expects the economic pain will be widespread. He expects growth in Europe \u2014 which is only just starting to pick up \u2014 to slow. And China, which is still struggling in the aftermath of the collapse of a real-estate bubble, could also succumb.\n\nThe upshot is that, in this scenario, global growth would weaken at large, weighing on global stocks.\n\nAs far as the U.S. is concerned, Berezin\u2019s thesis is rooted in the notion that a slowdown in the labor market is poised to accelerate rapidly \u2014 heaping enormous pressure on consumer spending, a key economic driver.\n\nHe rattled off a number of indicators suggesting that the torrid pace of pandemic-era hiring has given way to something far less appealing to workers. As official job-openings data show, the number of open positions have fallen substantially, as has the quit rate. And private surveys of job openings reflect an even more dramatic decline.\n\nAt the same time, Labor Department data show that the pace of wage growth has slowed.\n\nThere have also been signs that consumer spending has been slowing in recently released economic data, including Friday\u2019s personal-consumption expenditures price index for May.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Berezin believes this could be only the beginning, as a suddenly enfeebled labor market may kick off a vicious cycle.\n\nData on bank balances already show that lower-income Americans appear to have depleted their pandemic-era savings. As delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans \u2014 already at levels unseen since 2010 \u2014 continue to climb, banks could opt to raise their lending standards, adding to pressures facing the consumer.\n\nAs the consumer slows, Berezin expects businesses could slow their spending on capital projects.\n\nIndeed, data collected by BCA that tracks businesses\u2019 spending plans show that many are already preparing to cut back on capital expenditures, or \u201ccapex,\u201d despite the artificial-intelligence boom, the CHIPS Act and ongoing reshoring trends that Wall Street believes should boost this type of spending.\n\nOnce the recession envisioned by Berezin arrives, the Federal Reserve likely won\u2019t swoop in to stop it \u2014 at least not right away. Fear of reigniting a second wave of inflation likely means Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues would be reluctant to act until it is already too late.\n\nAnd fiscal policy likely won\u2019t be much help, either. The budget deficit is already projected to grow to 7% of GDP in 2024, according to official Congressional Budget Office estimates. Right now, the U.S. is in dire need of fiscal discipline, not an increase in deficit spending.\n\nAs a result, regardless of who wins in November, the bond market would likely rebel against any attempts to increase unfunded spending.\n\nBCA recommended that clients reduce their equity holdings while boosting their allocations to bonds and cash earlier this week.\n\nBut for those more inclined toward tactical trades, Berezin recommended a few, including shorting the price of bitcoin BTCUSD and betting that falling bond yields will drag the U.S. dollar DXY lower against the Japanese yen USDJPY. Berezin expects that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y could fall to 3% if his recession scenario pans out, while the fed-funds target rate could be cut to 2%.\n\nBy comparison, the 10-year was at 4.34% as of Friday, while the fed-funds target rate remains in a range of 5.25% and 5.5%.\n\nFor its part, J.P Morgan\u2019s top strategist, Marko Kolanovic, reaffirmed his target for the S&P 500, which is calling for the index to drop more than 23% from current levels by year\u2019s end.\n\nAccording to JPM\u2019s midyear outlook, released this week, the investment bank expects U.S. growth to moderate during the second half of 2024.\n\nThe investment bank\u2019s bear case for stocks is based on the notion that the megacap names that have driven much of the market\u2019s rally over the past year will face an increasingly high bar to impress investors with their earnings and forecasts.\n\nInvestor positioning and valuations for these names already look stretched, according to Kolanovic. This means that at some point, the artificial-intelligence trade that has been holding up the market should reverse \u2014 and when that happens, the S&P 500 should see a major pullback.\n\nU.S. stocks were dipping in the red on Friday afternoon, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite COMP struggled in their attempt to finish off the first half of 2024 at record highs. The two indexes were each losing more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 0.3%.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch",

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 75%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "A resurgence in the popularity of stock splits has been front and center in 2024 as a number of high-profile stocks have taken the plunge. Companies will typically go down this path after years or even decades of robust operating and financial results have pushed the stock price out of reach of some investors. While a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying value of the business, it does make shares more affordable for employees and everyday investors, a reason that is often given by companies as the principal motivation for the split.\n\nInvestors, however, should focus on the robust results that ultimately led to the stock split, as this is historically an indicator of a business that is firing on all cylinders, which is a brilliant reason to own the stock.\n\nLet's take a look at two companies that still have significant upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 59%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with mounds of upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was already the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and in data centers. However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) early last year kicked its business into overdrive.\n\nThe company is referred to as a \"picks-and-shovels play.\" The investing reference has its origins in a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\" For the AI gold rush, Nvidia is supplying the picks and shovels.\n\nThe parallel-processing capability of Nvidia's GPUs was groundbreaking for rendering lifelike images in video games. It allows them to run a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It turns out this same functionality works equally well at processing AI.\n\nNvidia's recent results show why most analysts on Wall Street are upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes the processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest money maker, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.\n\nNvidia recently completed its high-profile, 10-for-1 stock split, and despite posting gains of more than 194% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains remarkably bullish. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann boosted his price target to $200 while reiterating a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 59% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerating demand for AI-centric processors forms the foundation of the analyst's thesis, but he believes the secret sauce is Nvidia's proprietary software that's coupled with its best-in-class chips.\n\n\"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. The analyst's price target suggests Nvidia's market will soar to nearly $5 trillion over the next year.\n\nDespite the stock's epic run over the past year, Wall Street is still remarkably bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Implied upside of 75%\n\nAnother stock-split stock with significant upside potential is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The company's focus on health-centric energy drinks has been a hit with consumers. It's the third-largest energy drink brand and the fastest-growing, contributing 47% of all industry growth in the first quarter, outpacing larger rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage.\n\nCelsius holds an enviable position in an industry that continues to grow. The energy drink category has continued to generate robust growth over the past three years, even as the broader beverage category has contracted -- and Celsius is leading the charge.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS surged 108%. It's always encouraging when profits are growing faster than revenue, as this illustrates that a company has reached the scale necessary to drop more income to the bottom line.\n\nThe company's sales more than doubled last year as it leaned into its partnership with PepsiCo, which resulted in the beverage and snacks giant making a $550 million investment in Celsius, taking an 8.5% stake in the company and inking a long-term distribution agreement. This is a double-edged sword, however, as Celsius now faces tough comps after such a banner year.\n\nCelsius Holdings conducted its 3-for-1 stock split late last year, thanks to its track record of robust performance. However, fears regarding slowing growth have punished the stock, which has shed 42% over the past month, but some on Wall Street are undaunted. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala has a $98 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 75% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst noted the drawdown is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and advises investors to ignore the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Celsius. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 14 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

About 100 production employees at the company\u2019s Dubuque, Iowa, plant will also be impacted. All layoffs are said to be effective from Aug. 30, the company tells Fox Business.\n\nThe layoffs are being made due to reduced demand for John Deere's products from those factories.\n\nThe company says it generated $10.166 billion in profits last year.\n\nJOHN DEERE EXPERT PREDICTS BATTERY-POWERED LAWN MOWER DEMAND WILL \u2018RAPIDLY ESCALATE\u2019\n\n\"We can confirm Deere leadership recently communicated that rising operational costs and declining market demand requires enterprise-wide changes in how work gets done to achieve our goals and best position the company for the future,\" a statement from John Deere reads.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nWorkers are to be offered Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) which will cover about 95% of their weekly net pay for up to 26 weeks, depending on their years of service.

        "body": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nThe weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.\n\nIn life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.\n\nSure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.\n\nTrust me, it's not \u2014 and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.\n\nThis same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nI know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.\n\nOver the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.\n\nFor perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.\n\nSome folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my \"Opening Bid\" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.\n\nAll of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.\n\nBut if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.\n\nNvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. \"In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,\" Krinsky said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nSimilar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to \"in-line\" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.\n\nAnd I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.\n\n\"When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that\u2019s a bad sign \u2014 a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\nOthers don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!\n\n\"But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,\" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.\n\nSpeaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however. WSJ reporter Dana Mattioli talked about her explosive new book \"The Everything War: Amazon\u2019s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power\" in an episode of the \"Opening Bid\" podcast.

        "title": "I Want to Put My RMDs in a Roth IRA, But Was Told I Can't. Is That True?",
        "body": "A woman and her husband look over their IRA balances as they talk about their plan for retirement.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a tax-savvy way to deal with you required minimum distributions (RMDs), converting them into a Roth IRA isn\u2019t an option.\n\nA financial advisor can help you plan for RMDs and figure out if a Roth conversion is right for you.\n\nIt\u2019s relatively common for retirees to need a plan for their required minimum distributions. That\u2019s particularly true for households that don\u2019t need their RMDs to cover living expenses and other spending needs. While you can reinvest these withdrawals in taxable accounts, the IRS restricts how you can fund tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA.\n\nAmong those restrictions: you can only make IRA contributions with earned income. As a result, you can\u2019t use RMDs to directly fund a Roth IRA.\n\nWhat Are RMDs?\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs) are the mandatory withdrawals that must be taken from a tax-deferred retirement account starting atage 73.\n\nStarting at age 73 (or 72 depending on your birthdate), the IRS requires you to begin withdrawing a minimum amount each year from your pre-tax retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs. The exact amount depends on your age and the amount in your portfolio. To calculate your RMD, you divide the portfolio\u2019s balance at the end of the year by a published life expectancy factor.\n\nFor any given year that you don\u2019t take the full distribution, the IRS will charge you a tax penalty of either 10% or 25% of the amount that\u2019s not withdrawn. For example, say that you don\u2019t withdraw a required $10,000. You could face a tax penalty of up to $2,500.\n\nThe IRS requires you to take RMDs from tax-deferred accounts because each withdrawal is a tax event that triggers income taxes. Since you\u2019ve already paid taxes on the money in Roth accounts, the IRS doesn\u2019t require you to take minimum distributions from them. But if you have additional questions surrounding RMDs, consider speaking with a financial advisor.\n\nCan You Invest RMDs in a Roth IRA?\n\nFor some retirees, the problem with a required minimum distribution is that they don\u2019t need the money yet. This comes up, particularly for people who alreasdy sufficient income streams or those who hold multiple accounts and want to draw them down one at a time.\n\nWhile you have several options for how to manage these distributions, you cannot reinvest them in a Roth IRA.\n\nRoth IRA Requirements\n\nYou can only make IRA contributions with what\u2019s called \u201cearned income. This is defined as money that you receive from wages, salary, contract income and other forms of work. You cannot make contributions to an IRA \u2013 whether its a traditional or Roth account \u2013 from investment proceeds, capital gains or many passive income streams like rental properties.\n\nThis means that you\u2019re free to get a job in retirement and put that money into a Roth IRA for later in life. However, you cannot withdraw money from a portfolio and transfer it into a Roth IRA or any other form of tax-advantaged retirement account. The IRS discusses this restriction in full in Publication 590-A.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversions Are Also Restricted\n\nThis subject can get confusing because of the overlap between a withdrawal and a conversion. When you have a pre-tax portfolio, like a 401(k) or an IRA, you are allowed move money directly into a Roth IRA in what\u2019s called a conversion. You take out a lump sum of money from a tax-deferred account, pay income taxes on the amount and deposit it into the Roth IRA.\n\nHowever, the IRS specifically prohibits you from converting any required distributions into a Roth IRA. You can convert money that isn\u2019t a required distribution, but the law is unambiguous that you cannot do so with an RMD. Navigating the IRS rules for RMDs and Roth conversions can be confusing, which is way you may want to consider connecting with a financial advisor.\n\nAlternative Options for Roth IRAs and Required Minimum Distributions\n\nA woman considers what to do with her RMD in the coming year.\n\nSo, what should you do instead? For retirees, there are a couple of options for how to manage RMDs.\n\nFirst, you can convert the rest of your pre-tax portfolio after you meet the RMD requirements. In any year with an RMD, the first dollars you withdraw from that account are treated as part of your RMD. Once you meet the minimum amount, you\u2019re free to convert the rest of your account (in whole or in part) into a Roth.\n\nSay you have a $10,000 RMD in a given year. You first must withdraw that $10,000 before you may convert any remaining, eligible amount in your retirement account to a Roth IRA. As always, when doing so remember that Roth earnings have a five-year cooling-off period, so make sure you won\u2019t need this money right away. And if you withdraw any of the money you convert before the five-year period is up, you could owe a 10% penalty on the money (unless you\u2019re age 59 \u00bd or older).\n\nSecond, it is common for retirees to reinvest their minimum distributions. While you can\u2019t put this money back into a tax-advantaged retirement account, you can put it into a taxable investment portfolio. The exact nature of these investments will vary based on your financial strategy and needs. Some retirees may do well investing for growth, taking money that they don\u2019t need and putting it into equity-heavy funds. Others may do well investing for security, taking money that they will need someday and putting it into bond-heavy funds or annuities.\n\nBut if you need additional help reinvesting your RMDs, a financial advisor can help you make a plan to put this money to work for you.\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou cannot reinvest required minimum distributions in a Roth IRA. While you can convert any remaining amount from your pre-tax retirement account, the IRS specifically prohibits you from putting RMD funds in a tax-advantaged portfolio. However, RMDs don\u2019t not need to be the end of your investing. You are free to invest this money in a taxable account as you see fit or convert your remaining IRA or 401(k) funds into a Roth account after your RMD for the year has been met.\n\nTips on Managing Required Minimum Distributions\n\nThe RMD formula can be difficult to manage, mostly because the IRS\u2019 \u201clife expectancy factor\u201d can seem very arbitrary on the surface. But figuring out what you will need to withdraw is an important piece of long-term retirement planning puzzle.\n\nA financial advisor can help you plan for and manage your RMDs. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Fly View Productions, \u00a9iStock.com/designer491, \u00a9iStock.com/SDI Productions\n\nThe post I Was Planning on Taking My RMDs and Converting Them to a Roth, But Was Told I Can\u2019t.

        "body": "Woman Working 3 Jobs Struggling With A Lifetime Of Overdrafts Receives An Unexpected Gift From Dave Ramsey, Bringing Her To Tears\n\nDuring an episode of the personal finance help show, The Dave Ramsey Show, the show host and celebrated finance guru, Dave Ramsey, received a call from a woman who decided to change her finances. She called for advice and left with an unexpected gift from Ramsey.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\n\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\n\nThe episode started with caller Tasia, who revealed to Ramsey that she had found his page on the TikTok social media app, which gave her the push she needed to start working her way out of debt. Tasia told Ramsey that she started her emergency fund, which Ramsey and his team have been teaching people to do. According to Ramsey Solutions, a starter emergency fund should have at least $1,000 as a temporary buffer, while a fully-funded emergency fund should save at least 3-6 months of expenses.\n\nIn addition to creating an emergency fund, Tasia told Ramsey that his advice helped her avoid overdrafting any accounts. Tasia revealed that she had been overdrafting her bank accounts her whole life, so this was a significant achievement for her, and Ramsey agreed. He told her, \"This is a breakthrough, isn't it, kid? Way to go.\"\n\nWhen it comes to overdraft, Tasia isn't alone. U.S. Sen. Bob Casey sent a news release in April this year slamming large corporate banks for profiting from excessive overdraft fees. In his statement, Casey wrote, \"Roughly 23 million households pay overdraft fees each year\" and that \"26 percent of Americans reside in a household that faced an overdraft fee or non-sufficient fund fee in the last year.\" Casey revealed that American families are struggling to make ends meet, and more are going into overdraft. According to ABC News, Americans paid a whopping $9 billion in overdraft fees last year, with banks charging around $35 per transaction in overdraft. Currently, lawmakers are in the process of passing a rule to try and cut these overdraft fees.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nNow that Tasia has managed to get herself out of overdraft, she can focus on growing her savings account. She told Ramsey that with her three jobs combined, she earns $90,000 annually and has around $30,000 still in debt, with half that amount being student loans. Ramsey told her, \"You're ready to go. You're ready to try new stuff because you're sick and tired of being sick and tired.\" Ramsey also told Tasia that he was proud of her and then revealed his gift to her: a paid 9-week Financial Peace University class and paid access to the EveryDollar budgeting app. Ramsey explained that he's gifting her this experience because she is the reason why he does the show. He explained, \"People that are like you, that have for the first time in your whole adult life, you're not doing overdraft because we taught you something,\" and added, \"Now, we're going to teach you how to get rid of this debt.\" Ramsey told Tasia he would teach her how to be a millionaire.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Ramsey had finished telling Tasia his gift to her, she was in tears at the unexpected gesture and told him, \"This has been my dream to talk to you.\" Ramsey told Tasia that he would help her take control of her money instead of wondering where it went, giving her the tools to make sound financial decisions. With Ramsey Solutions, Tasia will learn how to use the snowball method of paying off her debts, from smallest to largest. Ramsey promised that if she follows this advice and stays out of restaurants with no vacations, she would be 100% debt-free by next year.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Woman Working 3 Jobs Struggling With A Lifetime Of Overdrafts Receives An Unexpected Gift From Dave Ramsey, Bringing Her To Tears originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "If I Could Buy Only 3 Stocks in 2024, I Would Pick These",
        "body": "Investors can own as many stocks as they want whenever they want, and thankfully so. After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.\n\nSometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)\n\n1. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.\n\nMercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.\n\nAnd this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.\n\nAnd it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.\n\nEven so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.\n\nBecause e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nFew investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.\n\nIf you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.\n\nBetter yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.\n\nRatings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.\n\nGoogle Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.\n\nSo Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nI would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).\n\nIt's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.\n\nBofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.\n\nLargely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.\n\nWe do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.\n\nIn the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.\n\nIts annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Is Broadcom Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split on July 12?",
        "body": "When Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development.\n\nIn conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split. Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStock split recap\n\nA quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors.\n\nTo rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was \"to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees.\" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares, which are available at a number of brokerage firms.\n\nOnce the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy?\n\nThe process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results.\n\nIn the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%.\n\nThe company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout.\n\nA once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?\n\nMost experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits.\n\nWhile estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie.\n\nOver the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500. Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results.\n\nBroadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium.\n\nGiven the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split -- as long as you buy it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Nvidia will produce such a massive \u2018cash gusher\u2019 that it will have to buy back more stock because all that money has nowhere else to go, analyst says",
        "body": "AI chip leader Nvidia will have an embarrassment of riches in the coming years, and shareholders will be rewarded, a tech analysts predicted.\n\nBen Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, told CNBC on Wednesday that Jensen Huang's Nvidia has mastered a \"full stack\" approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.\n\n\"What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they're killing it,\" he said.\n\nReitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday's closing price. Despite an ongoing selloff that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.\n\nAnother big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can a budget for upgrades accordingly.\n\n\"And they're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,\" he said.\n\nGiven Nvidia's edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns.\n\nManagement may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it's obvious.\n\n\"No one's talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it's a cash gusher,\" he said. \"And there's nothing they can do. This government's not going to let them buy anything big. They can't invest that much in R&D. It's just not possible.

        "title": "Walmart Is a Rock-Solid Dividend King, but So Is This High-Yield Dividend Stock That's Down 11% in the Past 3 Months",
        "body": "With the spotlight on artificial intelligence (AI) and megacap growth stocks, it's easy to overlook the impressive run-up in stable stalwarts like Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Soaring just shy of 30% year to date, Walmart is the best-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- outpacing gains from Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and other growth stocks. What's more, Walmart has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years -- making it a Dividend King.\n\nWalmart has a clear plan for growing earnings and increasing its dividend -- but the stock has gotten more expensive and the yield is just 1.2%.\n\nTool and outdoor products maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) is also a Dividend King. But the stock is down over 10% in the last three months and a painful 57% over the last three years. Here's why Stanley Black & Decker is out of favor, how it is turning things around, and why it is worth buying now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA primer on Stanley Black & Decker\n\nStanley Black & Decker sells various hand tools, power tools, and accessories under brands like DeWalt, Stanley, Black+Decker, Craftsman, and others.\n\nA whopping $13.4 billion or 85% of 2023 revenue came from its tools and outdoor segment, while just $2.4 billion came from its industrial business-to-business (B2B) segment. Sixty-two percent of 2023 sales were generated in the U.S. As such, the company has been heavily impacted by inflation, higher interest rates, weak consumer spending, and a challenged housing market. Meanwhile, other industrial companies that primarily engage in B2B sales -- such as General Electric and Siemens -- are hovering around all-time highs.\n\nPeaks and valleys\n\nStanley Black & Decker has been on a roller coaster over the last few years. It achieved all-time high net income of $1.69 billion in 2021, only to lose a record $311 million in 2023. The following chart paints this dramatic picture well.\n\nSWK Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nYou may be wondering how a company can go from a period of growth and expansion to a period of weakness in just a few years. The short answer is that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the toolmaker's business, disrupting supply chains and consumer behavior. Initially, Stanley Black & Decker benefited from a surge in goods spending, which is reflected in its 2021 results. But by 2022, it became clear that demand was merely pulled forward by a few years and that the boom was unsustainable.\n\nStanley Black & Decker's operating expenses increased to keep up with demand. But when demand fell, and revenue began to decline, those higher expenses ate away at margins. In 2023, Stanley Black & Decker had an operating margin barely over 4% compared to a pre-pandemic range of about 12% to 14% -- illustrating how inefficient the business has become.\n\nStory continues\n\nSWK Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nGetting back on track\n\nThe company has implemented a massive cost-cutting effort to restore margins -- with a goal of reaching an adjusted gross margin of 35% over the long term and 30% for full-year 2024. Stanley Black & Decker achieved $145 million in pre-tax cost savings last quarter, bringing its aggregate cost savings to $1.2 billion since the program was launched in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTo its credit, Stanley Black & Decker has stayed on track toward hitting its goals. When it first announced the program, it was guiding for $1 billion in pre-tax savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion in savings within three years. During its first-quarter 2024 earnings call, Stanley Black & Decker said it was still targeting $1.5 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nReducing inventory has been another focus for the company. Stanley Black & Decker is forecasting $400 million to $500 million in inventory reductions for the full year and capital expenditures of just $400 million to $500 million. Reducing inventory and keeping a tight lid on spending should help the company reach its free-cash-flow (FCF) goal of $600 million to $800 million for the full year. That's still a way off from the $1.08 billion in FCF the company earned in full year 2019, which is a good benchmark considering it's before the pandemic disrupted its business.\n\nA high yield with a (potentially) inexpensive valuation\n\n2024 FCF guidance would allow Stanley Black & Decker to cover its dividend with FCF. In the recent quarter, Stanley Black & Decker paid $121.8 billion in dividends. Over the last couple of years, it has made minimum $0.01-per-share-per-quarter dividend raises to retain its status as a Dividend King -- which is understandable given the business is undergoing a turnaround. Therefore, investors should expect minimum raises over the next few years as well, meaning the annual dividend expense should be under $500 billion for 2024 and 2025.\n\nA lower stock price paired with a moderately higher dividend has pole-vaulted Stanley Black & Decker's yield to 3.8% -- which is significantly higher than the 2% or so yield investors were getting pre-pandemic.\n\nSWK Dividend Yield Chart\n\nGiven its net loss in 2023, Stanley Black & Decker currently has a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, analyst estimates reflect the impact of its cost-cutting efforts and a return to profitability. Average analyst estimates call for $4 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.48 in 2025 EPS. Based on the 2025 EPS guidance, Stanley Black & Decker would have a P/E ratio of just 15.5 -- which is dirt cheap for a Dividend King. However, a lot could go wrong between now and when that full-year 2025 figure rolls in -- so investors shouldn't bank on analyst estimates.\n\nStanley Black & Decker is worth the wait\n\nStanley Black & Decker poorly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and interest rates. And the stock price reflects these mistakes -- as it is just 15% or so off its 10-year low. However, the company has been doing a good job over the last seven quarters by sticking to its cost-cutting plan.\n\nIn the near term, Stanley Black & Decker's FCF projections indicate confidence that it can support its dividend with cash. Over the medium term, a return to profitability and earnings growth makes the stock look like a good value.\n\nEven as the business recovers, investors shouldn't expect the company to drastically increase its dividend or buy back stock. The balance sheet has weakened in recent years due to higher debt. S&P Global's June 20 annual review of the company gave it an A- credit rating, which is good but could be improved.\n\nAt times like this, it's important to zoom out and think about where a business will be three to five years from now. If Stanley Black & Decker can return to its pre-pandemic form and chart a path toward growth, the valuation and yield will make the stock look too cheap to ignore. Patient investors may want to scoop up shares of the Dividend King now, while others may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to ensure Stanley Black & Decker can effectively operate under a leaner business model.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Stanley Black & Decker right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Stanley Black & Decker, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Stanley Black & Decker wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Free streaming channels have become 'sleeping giants' as Netflix, Max, others hike prices",
        "body": "As streaming services get more expensive, consumers are increasingly turning to free content to fill out their entertainment diets.\n\nFree ad-supported streaming platforms like the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's (PARA) Pluto TV, among others, have seen viewership steadily rise over the past few years, a surprising development given the lack of original content and heavy ad load on these channels, known as FAST channels.\n\nFAST \u2014 which stands for free ad-supported streaming television \u2014 provides both linear and on-demand content in a single viewing experience that relies on advertising for monetization.\n\nThe rise of FAST comes as nearly every major streaming service has raised prices in recent months, including Paramount, Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n\"It is different to be 100% free,\" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer podcast \"The Town With Matthew Belloni\" in April.\n\n\"We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.\"\n\nIn other words, what appeals to users is the accessibility. Julie Clark, executive at marketing insights company TransUnion, described the model as a \"sleeping giant\" in the ever-evolving media landscape.\n\n\"FAST is easy, it's accessible,\" she told Yahoo Finance. \"You can get the basics that you need, like the news and the weather, but there's also older programming available and they're starting to have better distribution agreements there as well.\"\n\nTo put it simply, FAST is the closest thing you can get to cable without actually paying for it. Not to mention that certain FAST providers, like the Roku Channel and Samsung's TV Plus, are also distributed across their respective smart TV devices, further broadening their presence for users.\n\n\"There's this catalog of content that is available within the FAST environment that you can binge all day,\" Clark said. \"And with recent price sensitivities, I think we're going to continue to see this grow.\"\n\nContent on FAST channels can encompass everything from made-for-TV movies and old shows from traditional studios to low-budget unscripted series, short-form videos, documentaries, and sports.\n\nYou still won't catch the new season of \"Bridgerton\" or the latest episode of \"The Bear.\" But for cost-conscious consumers, that might not matter.\n\nTubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, led year-over-year growth for the network following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase in May, according to Nielsen. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive? Its average audience for May came in ahead of traditional streamers Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.\n\n\"A lot of people confuse Tubi as being sort of this passive FAST channel that is just on rotation in the background of a person's household. It's not,\" Fox CFO Steven Tomsic said at a MoffettNathanson conference last month. \"90% of Tubi consumption is [video on-demand] where it's a real lean-forward experience. People have deliberately chosen the title and watch through it.\"\n\nTubi has experimented with original content, but its bread and butter revolves around its library. Tubi boasts more than 240,000 movies and TV series on its platform, the bulk of which is licensed. Its audience is 63% made up of \"cord cutters\" or \"cord nevers,\" while 40% are not subscribed to other traditional streamers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Roku Channel, which has also dabbled in some original programming, saw a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing. That led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV \u2014 the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.\n\nCompetitors have taken notice. Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix is weighing its own free ad-supported tier in certain markets like Europe and Asia. It won't roll out a free version in the US since its subscriber base in the country is already heavily penetrated, according to the report.\n\nThe Roku logo on a remote control in Portland, Ore., Aug. 13, 2020. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut the FAST business model remains unproven. Tubi, for example, has yet to turn a profit. The long-term outlook also remains murky against the expected reacceleration of M&A within the media industry at large.\n\n\"I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,\" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance. He noted FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach than other streamers, given their lack of premium or exclusive content.\n\n\"A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using ad technology to target the users that they do have,\" Nollen said. \"It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.\"\n\nCompanies like Paramount, Fox, and Roku do not break out the financials of their respective FAST channels, although they're consistently called out as growth drivers on earnings calls.\n\nParamount, for instance, credited Pluto TV for its double-digit advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. Roku and Fox did the same.\n\nThe rise of ads on streaming\n\nAdvertising on connected TV, which refers to devices and platforms connected to the internet, has exploded in recent years. And it's not just FAST channels benefiting from the transition.\n\nCompanies like Netflix, Disney, and, most recently, Amazon have entered the ad-supported streaming space in recent years. That means more inventory and also more opportunities to better target and monetize consumers through technology.\n\n\"There's a lot of ability for advertisers to test, learn, and use sophisticated targeting that was only available within traditional digital advertising before,\" Clark told Yahoo Finance. \"That is absolutely leading to some of the growth in FAST and other ad-supported services.\"\n\nMoffettNathanson predicted total advertising on over-the-top streaming services will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023, fueled by more consumers choosing ad-based streaming tiers.\n\n\"There's a comfort level [in] that value exchange,\" Clark said. \"Even younger consumers are getting used to ads on YouTube, so it's this natural progression.\"\n\nAds are also easier to stomach if you know you're paying less (or nothing at all) to watch them.\n\n\"People value choice at the end of the day. And we have always been used to watching ads, whether it be on a cable network or on YouTube,\" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions.\n\n\"But now we have a choice. And if I can save money, I may be more willing to make that compromise.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: This ETF Could Turn $25,000 Into $1 Million",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has generated some massive returns for investors in recent years. But the danger in buying the stock today is that at an extremely high valuation, you might be limited in the returns you get from it. While it may still be a good long-term investment, you may be better off putting your money into other growth stocks instead.\n\nYou could even simplify your strategy even further by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which can give you exposure to a broad range of stocks while still putting you on a path to generate some great returns.\n\nA fund with tremendous long-run potential\n\nFor growth investors, one ETF that is a popular option is the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ). It tracks the Nasdaq-100 index and gives investors exposure to the top growth stocks in the world within just a single investment. It's a safer alternative than putting all or even most of your money into a few investments, even if you're incredibly bullish on them.\n\nWith the Invesco fund, you don't even need to stay on top of what the hot new growth stocks are, as the Nasdaq-100 is made up of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the exchange. You'll still get exposure to Nvidia, but along with that, you'll also have exposure to Microsoft, Apple, and many other top tech stocks.\n\nBy investing in the fund, you can put yourself in a good position to beat the markets. Over the past 10 years, the Invesco QQQ fund has generated total returns (which include dividends) of more than 450%, which is far higher than the S&P 500's comparable returns of 235%. That means that the ETF has averaged a compounded annual growth rate of 18.6% in the past decade -- well above the S&P 500's long-run average of around 10%.\n\nThe fund could put you on a path to reach $1 million\n\nThe Invesco ETF can be an ideal option for long-term investors due to the effects of compounding and its potential to generate significant annual returns. While a near-19% growth rate may be a bit of an optimistic expectation to set for any investment for the very long term, even at a much lower average annual return, the ETF could generate considerable wealth for investors who buy and hold.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you invest $25,000 into the ETF. If it averages an annual growth rate of around 13%, then after a period of 30 years, it'll grow to be worth nearly $1 million. If you're able to invest $30,000, it would take less than 29 years to get to $1 million. And if you can invest additional funds over the years, that can help accelerate your gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesco's ETF is a good default option for investors\n\nIf you're not sure what to invest in and are worried that hot stocks like Nvidia have become too expensive, the Invesco ETF can be a great option to consider investing in. It has a low expense ratio of 0.2%, and it gives you an easy way to invest in the best growth stocks in the world.\n\nEven if you don't have a lot of money to invest today, you can periodically add to your investment every month or year to build up your position over time. And regardless of whether the ETF is up or down at the time you invest, it's likely to perform well in the long run, and that's ultimately what is most important.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Investors who strive for a specific investment return should love dividends because they are concrete returns you can't lose once paid. For example, suppose you want to earn 10% on a stock you own for a year. If that stock pays a dividend yielding 5%, you're already halfway to your goal!\n\nYou can rest easier knowing you have something to show for your investment and aren't entirely at the mercy of Wall Street's (often irrational) volatility.\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) is a well-known dividend stock. It's famous for paying a rare monthly dividend and continually increasing the amount it pays. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years and counting.\n\nYou may have overlooked Realty Income recently. Shares have fallen 24% over the past five years.\n\nPay attention. I'll show you how powerful dividend stocks like Realty Income can be and why the stock is a wonderful buy today.\n\nDo dividends matter? More than you realize\n\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It's a company that acquires and leases real estate. In other words, it's like a landlord you can invest in, so that you can enjoy the cash flow real estate earns without buying buildings. Realty Income specializes in single-tenant retail properties, where one tenant, generally a consumer-facing business like a movie theater, convenience store, or gas station, rents the building.\n\nREITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so companies like Realty Income make great dividend stocks. Realty Income's dividend yield is approximately 6% at its current share price. Now, I get it. Nobody wants to be down 24% after five years. But the truth is that Realty Income's dividend has helped soften that blow quite a bit.\n\nWhile the stock price is down 24% after five years, the stock's total return, including dividends, has investors close to break-even.\n\nO Chart\n\nTo be fair to Realty Income, things have worked against the company these past five years. Real estate companies faced a generational crisis in COVID-19. Additionally, interest rates have surged higher. That's a problem for REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund new property acquisitions. Realty Income has gotten a bad rap, primarily due to bad luck.\n\nReady to melt your mind? Zoom out further and see how big a difference dividends make over time. Realty Income has badly trailed the S&P 500 on price appreciation after decades, but it handily outperforms with dividends.\n\nO Total Return Price Chart\n\nRealty Income's share price declines get all the attention. Ironically, the dividends created big returns over time. Again, Realty Income's stock is down due to bad luck (pandemic and high rates), not because it's a bad business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is the stock poised for a comeback?\n\nI suspect that Realty Income will eventually bounce back. For starters, the dividend, the most crucial aspect of the stock, is rock-solid. Analysts believe Realty Income will earn $4.22 per share this year. That is a dividend payout ratio of just 75% based on its annualized dividend per share.\n\nMeanwhile, many expect interest rates across the U.S. economy to fall over time. The FOMC, which controls the primary interest rate in the economy, has been looking for inflation to come down, and recent data points to precisely that happening. Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which is a tailwind for REITs like Realty Income.\n\nRealty Income stock now yields near its decade-high, and its price versus its cash flow is near its decade-low. That means the stock is cheap, and analysts still see Realty Income growing its distributable cash (profits for REITs) at a low-single-digit rate annually. Investors are looking at potential double-digit total returns when combining dividends and growth. A potentially higher valuation is just a bonus.\n\nO Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nRemember, stocks like Realty Income can make you rich with their dividends. It just might take time. Investors should have no concerns over the dividend moving forward, and the stock's potential rebound is more icing on the cake than the main course.\n\nSituations like this are how long-term investors win.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Bank of America Private Bank\u2019s biennial survey of wealthy Americans revealed a generational divide in the perceived greatest opportunities for asset investment and growth.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was some stark differences in approaches to investing and mindset toward overall investing,\u201d Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nMarket research company Escalent surveyed 1,007 high-net-worth Americans on behalf of Bank of America Private Bank. The respondents, who were divided into a younger cohort (ages 21 to 43) and an older cohort (44 and older), had a minimum of $3 million in investable assets apart from their primary residence.\n\n(Source: 2024 Bank of America Private Bank Study of Wealthy Americans)\n\nHere's what Bank of America discovered about the younger investors surveyed:\n\n47% of the younger cohort's portfolios are invested in stocks and bonds. That's much lower than the older cohort (74%).\n\nMore younger investors are invested in alternative assets than older investors, and almost all of the younger cohort (93%) said they plan to allocate more to alternatives in the next few years.\n\nNearly half (49%) of the young cohort own cryptocurrencies, and 38% expressed some interest. Behind real estate, this cohort ranked crypto as the top area for opportunity.\n\n45% of the younger cohort own physical gold as an asset, and another 45% said they are interested in owning it.\n\nDifferences in financial outlooks drove the disparities in investment allocations and where investors perceive opportunities to be.\n\nNotably, over 70% of younger wealthy investors no longer think it's possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing exclusively in a mix of stocks and bonds. In contrast, only 28% of older investors share that view.\n\nBank of America\n\nYounger investors' skepticism over traditional investments comes as the stock market has ripped higher in 2024. As Myles Udland wrote this week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 42% since the beginning of 2023, pacing an annualized rate of return near 26%, or almost three times the average 10% yearly return of the index over time.\n\nHowever, Pelzar saw this difference in viewpoint as \u201csomewhat understandable,\u201d citing the turbulence the younger generation has experienced in their investing lives.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation has seen in their investing lives two market crashes \u2026 and then over the course of the last few years, they\u2019ve seen an increasing correlation between stocks and bonds,\u201d Pelzar said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really colored their thinking around how they need to allocate assets in order to generate the returns they look for.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nA fan at the 150th running of the Kentucky Oaks on May 3, 2024, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. (Jeff Moreland/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThe survey revealed that the younger cohort focused their asset allocation on alternatives, and many expressed plans to allocate even more to these investments in the next few years.\n\nPelzar said this projected increase is \u201clargely reflective\u201d of the younger cohort\u2019s thoughts on the growth opportunities in the market. Because some of the alternative asset classes are less liquid, Pelzar said this implies that the younger generation is taking a longer-term view.\n\n\u201cYou see a much different profile between those two different cohorts, and I think that indicates lessons learned or things we need to be thinking about in terms of the investment landscape going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "body": "If you're an investor who doesn't already have access to billions in capital, you could probably learn a few things from the folks who do. Luckily, keeping tabs on the world's most successful investors isn't very hard to do.\n\nEvery three months, people managing a portfolio worth $100 million or more have to report their trading activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A quick look at the latest disclosures shows a handful of billionaire investors bought millions of shares of two dividend-paying stocks that currently offer ultra-high yields.\n\nShares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) offer yields that are several times the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, stocks rarely offer yields this high unless there's a good reason to worry about their ability to maintain their payout.\n\nLet's look at their recent performance to find out if following the lead of billionaire fund managers makes sense for your portfolio.\n\nAnnaly Capital\n\nAnnaly Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) instead of real estate. It earns a living in the margins between its short-term borrowing expenses and the interest it receives from the hopefully higher-yielding MBS in its portfolio.\n\nAt recent prices, Annaly shares offer a mind-blowing 13.6% yield. The enormous yield is attracting funds run by billionaires. Citadel Advisors, which is run by Ken Griffin, and Millennium Management, which is run by Israel Englander, bought shares in the first quarter.\n\nAnnaly Capital doesn't own real estate, so it has to use its MBS portfolio to secure loans. It doesn't happen often, but from time to time, the value of its MBS can dip. When this happens, lenders demand more capital, and the company can end up selling off portions of its portfolio at fire sale prices.\n\nNLY Dividend Chart\n\nBefore you jump up to fill your portfolio with shares of Annaly Capital, it's important to realize the company has lowered its dividend by 45.8% since 2019. Investors who bought the stock and reinvested all the dividends have gained only about 39% over the past decade.\n\nWhile there's a good chance that buying Annaly Capital now and holding over the long run also leads to positive gains, the unpredictability of its dividend makes it a bad choice for most income-seeking investors.\n\nPfizer\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma bought 18.9 million shares of Pfizer. The stock has fallen by more than half since its peak in late 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nPfizer's been dropping because record-breaking sales of its COVID-19-related products evaporated faster than the market expected. Now that the worst is over, though, the stock looks like a terrific bargain.\n\nPfizer's stock dropped, but the company still raised its dividend payout for the 15th consecutive year last December. The stock offers a 6.2% yield at recent prices, which is about 4.6 times more than you'd receive from the average dividend payer in the S&P 500.\n\nAt recent prices, you can buy Pfizer for around 11.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a reasonable valuation for a business you expect to grow at a snail's pace. A look at this drugmaker's recent performance and forward outlook suggests it will grow much faster than the market is expecting.\n\nPfizer invested heaps of COVID-19-related profits into new drugs, many of which are already on the market. If we exclude COVID-19-related sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, first-quarter sales rose 11% year over year.\n\nPfizer has the longest list of innovative new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, and it's still growing relatively quickly. The FDA approved nine new medicines from the company in 2023, and they're poised to drive growth in the decade ahead. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio looks like a relatively safe way for income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Annaly Capital Management wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar 18,647% by 2032. 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before They Do (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "body": "Many experts believe the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly impact the technology and business landscapes. These advanced systems can generate original content, streamline time-consuming processes, and automate procedures -- all with a few simple commands. This, in turn, promises to increase productivity and save money, which has companies racing to adopt the next-generation algorithms.\n\nOne of the most obvious beneficiaries of this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower required to process AI training and inference. However, the investing community is beginning to look beyond the first phase of AI adoption (hardware) to what comes next, which will invariably be AI-infused software. It's estimated that generative AI software sales could soar as much as 18,647% to $280 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nWhile there's little doubt that Nvidia will continue to prosper from its early adoption of AI, another company has decades of experience in the field and is poised to profit as the tidal wave of AI software adoption commences.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAn AI pioneer\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) established itself as one of the early leaders in the AI revolution more than two decades ago. The company partnered with U.S. government agencies and its allies to develop AI software tools to aid in the war on terror. Its AI-powered data mining systems connected the dots between seemingly unrelated bits of information to helped flush out terrorists. In recent years Palantir has focused its attention on the enterprise sector, providing companies with actionable information to make data-driven decisions.\n\nWith decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to pivot quickly and develop state-of-the-art generative AI tools to help businesses succeed. The company's latest brainchild is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which provides users with keen insight to solve everyday business dilemmas.\n\nOne Palantir demo video shows the impact of shuttering a production line in the face of an oncoming hurricane. AIP provides suggestions regarding which orders to accelerate, delay, or cancel, which orders can be rerouted to other distribution centers, and how those decisions will affect backlogs and the associated sales. It can also estimate the financial impact of hiring additional trucks to accelerate high-priority deliveries before the storm hits, assessing how this will affect profits.\n\nMost businesses would jump at the opportunity to deploy tools with those capabilities, but the complexity alone would be enough to confound all but the most technologically savvy executives. Palantir addressed the issue by staging AIP boot camps. Developers and executives alike can attend these hands-on sessions, allowing them to build sophisticated applications alongside Palantir engineers and building real-world, company-specific solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis strategy has been wildly successful, helping Palantir increase its U.S. commercial customer count by 69% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter. This was largely thanks to AIP bootcamps and the resulting accelerated deal volume.\n\nThis helps illustrate the vast potential of Palantir's boot camp strategy.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nThe results have only just begun to impact the company's financial results. In the first quarter, revenue of $634 million grew 21% year over year and 4% quarter over year, resulting in Palantir's sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue (RDV), or the remaining value of contracts not yet recorded as revenue, grew 74%.\n\nManagement expects the company's growth streak to continue. Palantir increased its full-year outlook and is now expecting revenue of $2.68 billion, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Perhaps more telling, however, is the expected strong showing from U.S. commercial revenue, which is expected to clock in at least $661 million, an increase of 45%. That's up compared to its guidance of 40% growth issued just last quarter. This suggests there's continuing strong demand for AIP boot camps.\n\nEvery rose has its thorns\n\nThe company's rapid growth and ties to AI aside, some investors will be put off by Palantir's valuation, which is understandable -- but looks can be deceiving. The stock currently trades for 211 times earnings and 25 times sales, which is enough to make any value investors run for cover. However, rapid growth tends to skew the most commonly used valuation metrics. However, a more useful measure in this case is the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which clocks in at 0.79, when anything less than 1 indicates an undervalued stock.\n\nGenerative AI is still in the early stages of adoption, and the resulting rollout could take years to accomplish. Palantir is poised to be an early winner in the next phase of the AI revolution thanks to its decades of expertise and brilliant go-to-market strategy.\n\nThat's why Palantir stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Want $1,000 in Super-Safe Dividend Income? Buy $11,862 of This Ultra-High-Dividend Yield Stock",
        "body": "Investors love tobacco stocks because of their high dividend yields and growing dividend payouts. Long-term shareholders in these companies have made a fortune by simply holding and watching the dividend payments pile up in their accounts.\n\nToday, Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has a dividend yield of 8.43%. The United States-focused tobacco giant can generate $1,000 in annual dividend income for investors who buy $11,862 worth of stock right now. But is this dividend sustainable? Is Altria Group a safe dividend stock today?\n\nI think it is. Here's why Altria Group is a smart play for investors looking to build a diversified dividend income portfolio.\n\nVolume declines, but rising new categories\n\nAltria Group owns the U.S. brand of Marlboro, which is the top premium cigarette in the country with around 40% market share. This dominance has been retained for decades. However, investors are worried about accelerating overall volume declines in the cigarette category, which has caused stocks such as Altria to underperform the market.\n\nFor example, last quarter Altria estimated that cigarette volumes declined by 9% year over year for the entire U.S. market. Despite this, the company's net revenue for smokeable products only declined by 2.3%, with segment operating profit declining by a similar amount as well. While this isn't an ideal situation, Altria has been able to raise prices to counteract volume declines for decades to maintain profits.\n\nSmokeable products are the majority of Altria's $11.4 billion in operating profits today, but they're increasingly getting replaced by new nicotine products in vaping and nicotine pouches. The company's recent acquisition of the Njoy brand has a market share of 4.3%, which grew by 0.6 percentage points last quarter. Now, the U.S. government and law enforcement are increasing crackdowns on illegal vaping devices, which should help Njoy greatly increase market share.\n\nOn top of this, the On! nicotine pouch brand grew shipment volumes by 32% year over year last quarter. It is still a tiny part of the brand portfolio but should continue to grow quickly. It might help too that the largest competitor in nicotine pouches, Zyn, is seeing supply shortages in the United States right now.\n\nThe dividend is not only safe, but can grow\n\nRecent 9% volume declines and a 2% decrease in profits for the smokeable category are concerning for investors. However, running the math on Altria's dividend payout shows the 8%+ dividend yield is here to stay.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Altria has paid a dividend per share of $3.88. Free cash flow per share -- the fuel for dividend payments -- was $5 and has been consistently above the dividend per share for the last five years. Altria is also reducing its shares outstanding through a stock buyback program, which has brought shares outstanding down by a cumulative 8% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving 8% fewer shares means an 8% lower cumulative dividend payout while maintaining the same dividend per share level. It also helps free cash flow per share grow, even if nominal free cash flow is flat. So, even if Altria's earnings stagnate due to heavy volume declines, the company has plenty of room to grow its dividend per share due to the wide spread between its dividend payout and free cash flow along with the consistent buyback program.\n\nMO Dividend Yield Chart\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nWith such a high dividend yield, I think contrarian investors looking to build retirement income are smart to buy Altria Group stock today. Its dividend yield has gone from less than 4% to over 8% in the last 10 years as the stock has suffered. But the business is still in fine shape and has the earnings power to maintain a growing dividend over the next five years and beyond.\n\nBuying a little over $11,000 of Altria stock can deliver $1,000 in dividend income to your portfolio every year. Investors should remember to diversify their holdings, though. If $11,000 is a large investment for you, start with a smaller amount and build up your dividend income by buying more shares over time. It is never smart to go all in on one stock, as no company is a risk-free investment. The same holds true for Altria and any other tobacco stock.\n\nWith investors piling into technology and AI stocks at huge earnings multiples, it may be smart to zig while others are zagging and buy some high-dividend-yield stocks like Altria Group in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Altria Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in the Second Half and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "body": "The first half of the year brought the market many stock split announcements across industries, from technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to consumer stock Walmart. These companies launched splits to lower their share prices after the shares soared to high levels -- the idea is to make it easier for more people to invest without relying on fractional shares.\n\nThese players helped drive the S&P 500 higher in the first half of the year as investors welcomed the stock split news. Stock splits aren't share performance catalysts though, as they're just mechanical movements. So, investors who seize the opportunity to buy generally are making the move for a fundamental reason -- such as confidence in the company's future growth prospects.\n\nNow, as we head into the second half of the year, you may be wondering which stock split players may continue their paths higher and represent the best long-term bets. Let's check out one to buy hand over fist, and one to avoid like the plague.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStock to buy: Nvidia\n\nNvidia already climbed more than 150% in the first half of the year thanks to its booming artificial intelligence (AI) business. The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks -- and Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest on the market. So, it's no surprise the company holds 80% share of the AI chip market.\n\nThe tech giant also sells a wide range of related AI products and services, including enterprise software -- available through all of the public cloud service providers. This makes access to Nvidia very easy for potential customers.\n\nThis has helped the company generate record revenue quarter after quarter, grow revenue and net income in the triple digits, and widen gross margin. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached $26 billion and gross margin came in at more than 78% -- from about 64% a year ago.\n\nWhat makes me so optimistic about Nvidia in the second half and beyond? The company pledges to update its top performing chips on an annual basis, a strategy that should keep it ahead of rivals. As part of this, later this year Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture and chip -- a system laced with many innovations that could make it a game-changer.\n\nAll of this means Nvidia merits its valuation of 46 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock's gains this year and into the future may be far from over.\n\nStock to avoid: Chipotle\n\nFirst, I'll start by saying Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) isn't necessarily a sell or an avoid for every investor. This fast casual chain has progressively increased earnings over time, and its expansion strategy should keep that going. Chipotle's brand strength also may help it lift revenue over the long run too. So, if you're looking to diversify your portfolio and want to buy a solid restaurant stock, you may consider adding a few shares or if you're a Chipotle shareholder today, you might want to hold on to your position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut for the value investor, Chipotle is a stock to avoid, and here's why. The stock trades for 59 times forward earnings estimates, extremely high for the industry and high considering the source of Chipotle's growth. It's important to note that comparable restaurant sales growth has been in the mid-single digits -- increasing 7% in the first quarter of this year and 7.9% for the full year 2023. So Chipotle's growth mainly has come from adding on new restaurants -- it opened 271 last year.\n\nChipotle, now at about 3,500 locations, aims to double that to 7,000 in North America, and the company is expanding internationally too. It's fine to grow through expansion, but without stronger comparable sales increases, Chipotle doesn't look like a high-growth stock today, yet it's trading at growth stock prices.\n\nOf course, over time, Chipotle shares still may have room to run as the company's new locations start adding to revenue. But, considering the hefty price tag for this stock, as we transition into the second half of the year, value investors should avoid this expensive player like the plague.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "body": "Dividend stocks offer a great way to add cash to your portfolio and help you compound your overall returns with time. Whether you use that dividend money to add to your portfolio or cash it out, these types of stocks can help you diversify the types of businesses you own shares in.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in dividend stocks, you need to make sure the companies you buy have a strong underlying business and balance sheet that will support and help grow the dividends being paid out. A top dividend stock will also have a history of maintaining and raising its dividend in a wide range of market environments.\n\nOn that note, here are two top dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio. Each performs well, whether the bull market continues or bearish investor sentiment returns. If the bear market does return, these stocks have proven over the decades to be safe ones to hold.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has paid out and raised its dividend every single year for 62 years and counting. That places the pharmaceutical giant in a very select group of companies that have earned the moniker Dividend King.\n\nJ&J boasts a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, which is more than twice the average yield among S&P 500 stocks. Looking back over the last decade, Johnson & Johnson's dividend has increased an average of 6% annually. Its payout ratio is a very manageable 30%.\n\nJ&J's dividend helps to make up for the stock's relatively weak stock performance over the last several years. The weak stock performance also somewhat helps explain the higher-than-average yield. The stock is down based on several factors, but one of the biggest is ongoing litigation and potential multi-billion liabilities related to its talc products. The company has roughly $26 billion in cash on its balance sheet to help manage these ongoing lawsuits and eventually pay settlements while also maintaining its commitment to shareholders.\n\nInvesting in Johnson & Johnson also means putting cash into a company that has been in business for 138 years, and is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world by revenue. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has brought in over $17 billion in profits on about $86 billion in revenue. It's also generated approximately $24 billion in levered free cash flow looking back over the last 12 months.\n\nLast year, J&J spun off its slower-growing consumer healthcare product segment into a company called Kenvue. The remaining two divisions -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices -- are faster growing and should help J&J boost its growth efforts in the coming years. The company has returned approximately 60% of free cash flow to investors over the last five years, while 65% of sales come from products in which it controls the top or second global market share position.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the short term, this is likely not a business for growth-oriented investors. However, long-term investors seeking a company that generates steady financial gains from a broad portfolio of valuable pharmaceuticals and medical devices may find Johnson & Johnson poses a compelling investment opportunity. With its stock price underperforming, Johnson & Johnson's storied dividend history makes the business an attractive selection for income-seeking investors. When its underlying issues, including expensive litigation finally get resolved, share prices are likely to rise.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) boasts a dividend yield of around 3% and has faithfully raised its dividend every year for 62 years as well. The beverage giant doesn't generate massive stock price gains these days, but its dividend and share price increases have helped deliver a total return of 46% over the last five years and over 108% in the trailing 10-year period.\n\nFounded in 1886, the company now manages one of the largest beverage operations in the world. Coca-Cola controls roughly 46% of the soft drink market in the U.S., one of its largest markets.\n\nOver the trailing 12 months, Coca-Cola has delivered profits of about $11 billion on revenue of $46 billion. It's maintained a profit margin of around 23%, an exceptional figure in an industry where margins are historically razor-thin. The company has a payout ratio of about 74%, which is relatively high but still quite manageable. Its dividend has grown an average of 5% annually over the past decade.\n\nJust in the past 12 months, the company has brought in operating cash flow of about $12 billion, with levered free cash flow of approximately $11 billion. Currency headwinds and a fluctuating macro environment have impacted the company's growth in the last few years, but its commitment to its dividend and the strength of its balance sheet remain a testament to the resilience of this business.\n\nLong-term buy-and-hold investors looking for steady portfolio growth and dividends can find a lot to love about Coca-Cola.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Johnson & Johnson wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Some retirees are now cashing in on the golden age for retirement savings, when benefits were more generous and investments in real estate and stocks boomed. Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI\n\nAmid a widespread retirement crisis in the US, some boomers are entering their golden years flush with savings.\n\nThey're benefiting from now-rare pensions, real estate value increases, and stock market gains.\n\nBut lower-income households face challenges with retirement savings and dwindling pension plans.\n\nIf you're looking for Michael, 75, try looking to the sky.\n\nThe retiree has a unique retirement side gig: He's a corporate airplane pilot.\n\nHe dabbles just with contract gigs because he loves it; that's a common theme for Michael at this stage in life. He's living the retirement dream, and splitting his time between Florida and Denver. According to documentation that Business Insider reviewed, his net worth, after a career spent in the Navy and then working in geology, is just over $6 million.\n\n\"It's totally comfortable. We absolutely have all the money that we need to live our life,\" he said. And that nest egg has made a huge emotional difference: He has no financial stress.\n\nIt's a similar story for Connie, a 79-year-old who said she didn't really start retirement planning until she was in her 30s, newly divorced, and working a state government job in Oregon. After about 20 years in the public sector, she was able to retire with a nice pension \u2014 a type of benefit that's increasingly rare these days. Her Social Security checks were also bolstered when her former spouse's survivor benefits kicked in. In her retirement, she earns more than she did from her previous salary.\n\n\"It gives me great peace of mind,\" Connie said. It also fills her with some pride: Her research and frugality paid off.\n\n\"I definitely fall into that category of people who had just a totally ordinary career and never made big money, and yet now my retirement income is probably one and a half times what I ever made working,\" she said.\n\nThe three retirees Business Insider spoke with for this story are bright spots amid a retirement crisis in which over half of Americans 65 and older live on just $30,000 a year, and Social Security funds are expected to start depleting in 2035 without legislative intervention. All of their full names are known to BI, but their last names have been withheld over privacy concerns.\n\nAs the way we save for retirement has evolved, some people are now cashing in on the golden age for retirement savings \u2014 when benefits were more generous and investments in real estate and stocks boomed. While it's still possible to achieve, a fat retirement account has become rarer. And the retirees who are living that dream are grateful.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Being in retirement and not having any financial stress and being able to help our kids and travel to go see them and stuff like that, it is just a fantastic place to be,\" Michael said.\n\nThe confluence of factors that led to flush retirement accounts\n\nA stable retirement based on a lifetime of savings and smart decisions is possible \u2014 Michael and Connie are examples of that. But it's also a reality that's becoming increasingly rare, especially for lower-earning Americans.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office found in a 2023 report that lower-income households age 51 to 64 \u2014 those earning about a median of $19,100 \u2014 are increasingly less likely to have anything in a retirement account.\n\nBack in 2007, per GAO's calculations of the Survey of Consumer Finances, around 21% of low-income households had a retirement account balance. By 2019, that had fallen to 10%. While losses weren't as profound for those in the middle-income quintile, their retirement account balances did fall slightly from 2007 to 2019. As GAO finds: \"For all but the highest income group, there was no detectable difference between the median balances in 2019 and 2007.\"\n\nThe decline of one type of account, in particular, could be to blame. In recent decades, the US has shifted away from pensions, in which employers offer consistent payouts to former employees in their post-working years. Now, more American workers have defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s, which rely on workers to contribute funds to grow their coffers.\n\nThe share of low-income households with a defined benefit pension also fell by half from 2007 to 2019.\n\nMichael acknowledges that some people have likely worked hard for their whole lives, but didn't have higher-paying jobs \u2014 meaning they were able to put away less.\n\n\"Retirement could have gone the other way for us. I could have made a few bad decisions and we could have lost a lot of money and it would've been a different scenario in terms of comfort,\" he said.\n\n\"We got fortunate with a few investments and it just took off and grew,\" Michael added.\n\nThe assets that today's retirees do have are also prospering; 401(k) investments have been bolstered by a soaring stock market, meaning that people cashing in on retirement investments right now are on the winning end of historic S&P 500 highs.\n\n\"If we look at someone who had a 401(k) fairly early on, so between roughly 1982 and 2002, we had stock market returns that went fairly high,\" David John, senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP, told BI. He added: \"They managed to build retirement savings at a time where there was both stock market returns but also fairly low inflation.\"\n\nConnie opted for a variable account to fund her pension \u2014 her employers' contributions went into investments, rather than promising a fixed return each year. While her account lost money some years due to the market, overall, her earnings have still outpaced what she would've had with a simply fixed amount.\n\n\"There are a lot less pensions out there these days. That's true,\" Connie said.\n\nAnd for the current group of retirees with those perks, another thing might be boosting their bottom lines: Boomers are holding onto immensely valuable real estate. Thirty years ago, when today's retirees may have started buying real estate, homes were selling for a median of around $130,000. Today, they're going for nearly $300,000 more.\n\nToday's retirees also still have full Social Security benefits, something that's increasingly imperiled for the next generation of workers who are throwing in the towel. All of that comes as retirement savings become more of an individual onus.\n\n\"Essentially, the people who need it the most are the ones who are least likely to have a retirement savings plan or a pension,\" John said.\n\nSome have still been able to achieve this stability, but it's more of an uphill battle\n\nValerie, 46, is one of the Gen Xers trying to follow in the footsteps of prospering boomers. Valerie, who's based in Seattle, has already retired. According to documentation viewed by BI, she has over a million in her 401(k), but it's been hard-fought. Valerie \u2014 a former retail worker \u2014 tried to invest in real estate, but ended up on the other end of a hard market: Her properties went into foreclosure during the mortgage crisis, she said, and she \"barely had 20 bucks to survive.\"\n\n\"I kept thinking of all these other ideas, well, how do I build wealth again? Do I just give up? Is this the end of my life?\" she said. For Valerie, the answer ended up hinging on her 401(k) \u2014 she said she'd borrow against it to invest back into the market, and then repay those loans. Now that she has a retirement plan secured, she's more willing to take risks to build more wealth.\n\n\"When I was 18 to 19 years old, I remember predicting I'd be where I'm at financially in my retirement account if I didn't touch it and didn't bother it. And sure enough, the calculations are right,\" she said.\n\nValerie is one data point showing that it's also not all bad news for future retirees, but instead, perhaps more of an uphill battle.\n\n\"We have an economy that is changing rapidly and there are going to be opportunities for investment growth and savings and new products. I mean, there's an amazing amount of innovation going on there,\" John said. There is a chance it won't be as easy as it was for someone \"who started investing say in the 1980s or the 1990s and are now reaching the end of their careers,\" he said.\n\n\"But yes, going forward, it's still possible.\"\n\nAre you doing well in retirement, or worried you won't be able to retire?

        "title": "You Can Outperform 88% of Professional Fund Managers by Using This Simple Investment Strategy",
        "body": "Professional fund managers are in charge of investing billions of dollars for investors. They're often highly educated, have years of investment experience, and get paid well for their skills and expertise. But the truth is most aren't worth the fees they charge.\n\nIt doesn't take an advanced degree or special insider knowledge to do better than the vast majority of actively-managed mutual funds. A simple strategy can beat about 88% of them. It's a strategy Warren Buffett famously bet half a million dollars on with the expectation it could beat any hedge fund manager over 10 years.\n\nHe won the bet.\n\nAll you need to do is buy an S&P 500 index fund, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), and you can expect better long-term returns than most active mutual funds.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy 88% of active large-cap funds can't beat a simple index fund\n\nS&P Global publishes its SPIVA (S&P Indices Versus Active) scorecards twice a year. The scorecard compares the performance of active mutual funds (after fees) to relevant S&P benchmark indexes over periods of one, three, five, 10, and 15 years. It found that 88% of active large-cap funds failed to beat the S&P 500 over the last 15 years as of the end of 2023. Even when you look at a shorter three-year period, about 80% failed to beat the benchmark.\n\nThere are a couple of factors that lead to such dismal results for active funds as a group.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider how the stock market works. There's always someone on either side of a transaction; for every buyer, there's a seller. And among large-cap stocks, the people buying and selling shares are mostly institutional investors. In other words, one fund manager is typically selling their shares to another fund manager. They can't both be right.\n\nSince large institutions make up most of the market, the odds of outperforming the market as an active fund manager may be only a little better than 50/50. But the second factor severely diminishes the returns passed on to investors in actively-managed funds.\n\nFund managers, their teams, and the institutions they work for all require compensation. That means mutual fund investors have to pay fees. The most common fee is the expense ratio, which captures a portion of the assets under management. Those fees can climb well over 1%. That means the fund manager has to outperform the market by the fee they charge clients just to break even. And that's a lot harder than simply beating the market by a few basis points.\n\nAs a result, the percentage of actively-managed mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500 in any given year is only around 40%. And very few can consistently beat the market by enough every year to come out ahead in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nReduce your \"cost of participation\"\n\nIf you want to outperform the average investor, the key is reducing what Vanguard founder Jack Bogle called \"the cost of participation.\" Those are the costs you have to pay to invest your money.\n\nIt's become easier and less expensive to invest over the 25-plus years since Bogle coined that term. Portfolio transaction costs are near zero with most brokerages waiving commissions on stock purchases. On average, expense ratios for mutual funds have declined considerably from the mid-90s too. Still, an investor should aim to keep costs as low as possible, and that means avoiding unnecessary fees.\n\nSince active mutual funds cannot outperform their fees, on average, those fees should be deemed unnecessary. You can buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and practically match the market return for a fee of just 0.03%, or $3 for every $10,000 you invest.\n\nAnd while it's true some fund managers have outperformed their fees for a long time, identifying those funds beforehand is not so simple. What's more, there's no telling whether the results came from skill or luck, so you can't be certain the fund can continue its winning streak.\n\nAs a result, your best bet remains an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nWhat makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Buffett's top pick?\n\nIn Buffett's big bet against fund managers, he put his money in the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. Berkshire Hathaway owns a small amount of the S&P 500 ETF in its equity portfolio as well. There are a few things that make it his top pick.\n\nFirst, as mentioned, it has an expense ratio of 0.03%. That's one of the best in the industry.\n\nSecond, it has a very low tracking error. Tracking error tells you how consistently close (or wide) the ETF tracks the index it's benchmarked to. That can make a big difference for someone investing on a regular schedule. You want the fund to reflect the performance of the index, so your results match the results of the index over the long run. It's not worth sacrificing a low tracking error for a lower expense ratio, especially when the Vanguard fund is so cheap already.\n\nThere are many options to choose from, but the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF stands out as a top choice. It's a great option not just among other index funds but among all large-cap stock funds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here's Another Spectacular Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street",
        "body": "I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After all, how can you ignore a stock that soared nearly tenfold in just 18 months and now has a $3.1 trillion market cap, which accounts for 6.7% of the entire S&P 500 index? Not to mention, the company's chips are the driving force behind artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHowever, the incredible run in Nvidia stock made it quite expensive, even relative to its expected earnings a couple of years from now. Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker reaping the rewards of AI, so investors might find better value in other stocks in this space.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one to consider. The overwhelming majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal give it the highest possible buy rating, with none recommending selling. Here's why.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMicron is catching a tailwind from AI\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical for AI development. However, memory chips are a key component of those GPUs. They basically give AI models short-term memory, storing data in a ready state where it can be instantly called upon either for training purposes or when a user queries a chatbot.\n\nMicron makes the world's leading HBM3E (HBM stands for high-bandwidth memory) for the data center. HBM3E's architecture provides a higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory (like DDR), while occupying a smaller physical footprint that also consumes less energy. This means mountains of data can be transferred more quickly while reducing electricity costs. Both factors are top of mind for data center operators.\n\nMicron's HBM3E is so efficient that Nvidia is using it in its latest GPUs, including in the new H200, which can inference AI models (ingest live data and make predictions) twice as fast as its flagship H100.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30), Micron said its data center HBM solutions contributed $100 million in revenue. The company expects total HBM revenue to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars at the close of fiscal 2024 (ending Aug. 31), and several billions of dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, all of Micron's supply is completely sold out for next year already.\n\nBut Micron's AI opportunity doesn't stop at the data center, because AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) require up to 80% more memory (DRAM) capacity than traditional PCs. Micron says Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PC comes with a minimum DRAM content of 16GB, whereas the previous generation came with an 8GB option. Similarly, AI-enabled smartphones require up to double the memory capacity of their predecessors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese trends will lead to more money in the door for Micron.\n\nMicron's revenue is soaring, thanks to AI\n\nMicron generated $6.8 billion in revenue during Q3, representing year-over-year growth of 81%. That marked an acceleration from the prior quarter when revenue grew by 57%, which speaks to how quickly demand for AI is ramping up.\n\nBeneath the surface of the headline number, the results were even more impressive. Micron's compute and networking (data center) business, which is the largest of its four segments, grew revenue by 85% in the last year. Its mobile segment expanded even faster, with revenue soaring by 94% as the world's leading smartphone manufacturers race to integrate AI into their flagship devices.\n\nMicron also delivered a strong result at the bottom line. It generated $0.30 in earnings per share during Q3, which was a big swing from its $1.73 loss per share from the year-ago period. It was also above the high end of management's guidance of $0.24.\n\nAs I touched on earlier, supply of products like HBM3E is now sold out until the end of 2025, and those supply constraints give Micron the ability to charge higher prices. It translated to improved profitability in Q3, and that tailwind should persist for at least the next year.\n\nWall Street is very bullish on Micron stock\n\nMicron stock is up 72% so far this year and trading near an all-time high, but that hasn't deterred Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering the stock, and 27 give it the highest possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish camp), and two recommend holding. Although two analysts have assigned Micron an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.\n\nMicron's fiscal year 2024 wraps up in August. Its final earnings result will be compromised by weakness at the start of the year, stemming from an inventory glut in its consumer-oriented segments. But analysts already turned their attention to fiscal 2025, when they expect Micron to deliver $9.06 in earnings per share -- based on its closing stock price of $142.36 on June 26, which places it at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.7.\n\nFor perspective, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 35.9 today, implying Micron stock will have to more than double within the next year just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry (assuming Wall Street's earnings forecast is accurate). Plus, Nvidia trades at a forward P/E ratio of 46.6, which makes Micron stock look like an even better value.\n\nSince Micron's HBM3E memory is a key component in many of Nvidia's latest GPUs, any investor who thinks Nvidia will do well should also consider adding Micron to their portfolio, especially at the current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Sizzling Summer: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Red-Hot Power Demand",
        "body": "A heat wave has gripped much of the country this summer. That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.\n\nThe current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.\n\nInstead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.\n\nDominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.\n\nThus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.\n\nTo put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.\n\nLonger term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.\n\nCashing in on the summer's Sun\n\nMatt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).\n\nNextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.\n\nThe company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).\n\nDuke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns\n\nNeha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nDuke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.\n\nDuke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand.

        "body": "The unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.\n\nFour small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.\n\nThe saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.\n\nRegulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse\u2019s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.\n\n'Banking as a service'\n\nSynapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.\n\nIn just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called \"banking as a service.\"\n\nIt provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that in return got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.\n\nThe traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks when compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).\n\nThe largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was \"we\u2019ll bring in the deposits; you don\u2019t have to do much,\" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.\n\n\"This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,\" Mikula added.\n\nJelena McWilliams, former FDIC chair, is trustee in the Synapse bankruptcy. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nThe problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.\n\nThree weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.\n\nBoth parties blamed each other as the culprit.\n\n\"Synapse\u2019s abrupt shutdown of essential systems without notice and failure to provide necessary records needlessly jeopardized end users by hindering our ability to verify transactions, confirm end user balances, and comply with applicable law,\" Evolve said in a statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nSynapse CEO Sankaet Pathak rebuked this claim, accusing Evolve of having the means to settle a deficit yet delaying the return of customer funds.\n\n\"The debtor has been forced to play a perverse game of 'whack-a-mole' with unreasonable demands from Evolve as conditions to unfreezing the depositor accounts, all while the depositors suffer lack of access to their funds,\" Pathak stated in court documents last month.\n\nThe end result is that thousands of fintech customers lost access to their money.\n\n\u201cSynapse\u2019s bankruptcy has left tens of thousands of end-users of financial technology platforms that were customers of Synapse stranded without access to their funds,\u201d Jelena McWilliams, the court-appointed trustee to Synapse and a former FDIC chair, wrote in a letter last week to the heads of five federal banking regulators.\n\nThere was another problem: No one seemed to know where all of the money was.\n\nMcWilliams in early June said there was a shortfall of $85 million, with the four banks only accounting for $180 million of the $265 million belonging to end users.\n\nMore recently she said the range of the shortfall was $65 million to $96 million.\n\nSome money has been paid back to customers. McWilliams said on June 21 that more than $100 million \"has been distributed by certain of the partner banks.\"\n\nBlind spots\n\nBank regulators have been concerned for some time about the partnerships between Silicon Valley-style digital startups and FDIC-backed banks.\n\nActing Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu used a September 2023 speech to discuss the potential blind spots for regulators as these relationships become more blurry.\n\n\u201cBanks and tech firms, in an effort to provide a \u2018seamless\u2019 customer experience, are teaming up in ways that make it more difficult for customers, regulators, and the industry to distinguish between where the bank stops and where the tech firm starts,\u201d Hsu said in the speech.\n\nLast June, regulators issued final joint guidance on how lenders should handle these relationships.\n\nThese partnerships are not yet widespread across the entire banking industry, even though the use of this model is accelerating while banks of all sizes seek ways to attract deposits and earn more revenue.\n\nActing Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu has raised concerns about the ties between banks and fintech firms. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFewer than 2% of US banks used the banking-as-a-service model in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBut regulators are nonetheless getting more aggressive about calling out such relationships. The banking-as-a-service model accounted for 13.5% of public enforcement actions from regulators in 2023, according to S&P.\n\nIn January, the FDIC issued a consent order to one of Synapse\u2019s partner banks, Franklin, Tenn.-based Lineage, that identified weaknesses related to its banking-as-a-service program and ordered the bank to come up with a plan for how to achieve an \"orderly termination\" with significant fintech partners.\n\nThe next month, New York City-based Piermont Bank; Attica, Ohio-based Sutton Bank; and Martinsville, Va.-based Blue Ridge Bank received consent orders from regulators related to alleged deficiencies in their banking-as-a-service business.\n\nThen, earlier this month, the Fed issued an enforcement action against Evolve, saying that examinations conducted in 2023 \"found that Evolve engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices by failing to have in place an effective risk management framework\" for its partnerships with fintech companies.\n\nRegulators asked Evolve to improve its policies and risk management practices \"by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships.\" They also noted that the action was \"independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evolve said the recent order was \"similar to orders received by others in the industry\" and \"does not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits.\"\n\nThe bank counts Affirm (AFRM), Mastercard (MA), and Stripe as notable fintech partnerships on its website.\n\nIt has also in the past partnered with two crypto firms that went bankrupt, FTX and BlockFi, as well as Bytechip, a financial services firm had its accounts with Evolve frozen late last year on the allegation it violated federal law by laundering money for fraudsters.\n\nTo add to its recent challenges, Evolve said this past Wednesday that some customer data was illegally spread on the dark web as a result of \"a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization.\"\n\n\"Evolve has engaged the appropriate law enforcement authorities to aid in our investigation and response efforts,\" the bank said. \"This incident has been contained, and there is no ongoing threat.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "With a Senator Questioning Plug Power's Government Loan, Is This an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?",
        "body": "Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) surged in May after the company announced that it had received a conditional commitment for a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, the stock is now well below where it was before the announcement, and one U.S. senator has called the loan into question.\n\nThe stock, meanwhile, is now down over 70% in the past year.\n\nLet's look at the proposed DOE loan, why it is being called into question, why it is so important for Plug Power, and whether the slide in the stock is a buying opportunity.\n\nFixing a flawed business model\n\nPlug Power has long been grappling with a flawed business model, which it has set out to fix. The company initially found a niche selling fuel cells used in forklifts and other material-handling equipment to companies with high-volume, three-shift warehouses like Amazon and Walmart.\n\nBut the flaw in its business model was that it would sell the hydrogen fuel needed to run its fuel cells at a loss. This could be seen in the company's most recent results, where negative gross margin led to a $159 million gross loss.\n\nJust to emphasize how bad this is, the loss was measured before any corporate costs. The company loses a lot of money on the hydrogen fuel it sells, although in the first quarter, it also lost money on the equipment it sold.\n\nObviously, acquiring or making something for $3 and then selling it for $1 is not a durable business model, but that is pretty close to what Plug Power did last quarter with hydrogen fuel. Over the years, the company has mostly obtained hydrogen from third parties and sold it to its customers at a huge loss.\n\nThis is why it has embarked on building a network of its own hydrogen plants that can produce fuel that it can sell to its customers for a profit.\n\nThis is where the DOE loan comes in. In May, the company was given the chance to secure the loan -- if certain conditions to be negotiated by the company and the government are met -- to help it build out its hydrogen plant network. If it is approved, the loan would help fund up to six green hydrogen production facilities.\n\nPlug Power already has two plants up and running, and another is expected to be complete by the end of the year, and that would meet about 65% of where it sees demand headed.\n\nThe loan would help create a large plant in Texas scheduled for next year that would meet its customer needs and allow it to expand beyond that.\n\nHowever, in June, Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, asked the DOE's inspector general to investigate \"any potential impropriety\" by the the DOE\u2019s Loan Programs Office and the loan program's director, Jigar Shah, due to possible conflicts of interest. The senator also questioned Plug Power's viability given its $1.4 billion in losses last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Plug Power could pursue financing elsewhere if the loan ultimately does not get approved, the terms and interest rates would undoubtedly be much less favorable. And given the company's financial position and negative operating cash flow, there is no guarantee it would be able to find an institution to lend it the money.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs the sell-off a buying opportunity?\n\nPlug Power shares shot up as much as 70%, to $4.90, in the day after the DOE loan offer was announced. Today it is trading more than 15% below where it was before the announcement.\n\nIf the loan is approved, there should be some immediate upside potential given the past reaction and where the stock now trades. However, that could be short-lived.\n\nPlug Power, meanwhile, has said it is looking to get to gross margin breakeven in its fuel business in the fourth quarter, which would not be dependent on the loan. That is a potential catalyst, but a break-even gross margin is still not a complete solution because it will not make the company profitable or start generating cash.\n\nAt this point, I would view Plug Power more like a lottery ticket. If it gets the loan, builds out its plants, and turns positive in gross margin and free cash flow, there could be tremendous upside in the stock. But just like most lottery tickets, there is also the chance it becomes worthless.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Plug Power wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Another Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split Is Coming. Could Broadcom Be the Next Nvidia?",
        "body": "If you believe its hype, artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most profound advances in technology ever. This may be hyperbole -- time will tell -- but it's clear already that the technology has commercial power. Its impact in the market has been enormous, with its champion, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), joining Apple and Microsoft as among the biggest companies in the world.\n\nNvidia's rise led to the company splitting its stock 10-for-1, opening the door to more investors who were priced out. Now another company working in AI is splitting its stock, too. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which designs, manufactures, and sells hardware and network infrastructure that allows AI programs to run, will split its stock later this summer.\n\nSo let's consider: Could Broadcom deliver the sort of returns Nvidia has?\n\nRevenue growth has been impressive, but it's inflated by a major acquisition\n\nBroadcom is in growth mode, having raised Q1 revenue by 34% from the year before Q2 revenue by 43% from Q2 2023.\n\nAVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNotice the massive recent increase? That late-2023 inflection point is important. This growth isn't really organic -- much of it is coming from an acquisition. The company bought VMware, a highly successful cloud software company, in November 2023 for $69 billion, adding its revenue to Broadcom's.\n\nExcluding this additional income from VMware, the company grew Q2 revenue by 12% on a year-over-year basis, not quite as eye-watering as the headline-catching 43%.\n\nLooking at future earnings, the company looks reasonably valued\n\nStill, 12% organic growth is nothing to shake a stick at and reflects Broadcom's growing AI-focused business. Communication within the AI server farms that power platforms like ChatGPT is a crucial aspect and is where Broadcom shines. Its PCIe and Ethernet technology is some of the best on the market. This made its products popular.\n\nHock Tan, Broadcom president and CEO, stated in the company's latest earnings release that \"revenue from our AI products was a record $3.1 billion during the quarter.\" The combo of a growing AI business and a solid acquisition means that the company expects to continue delivering record revenues. It raised its guidance for this year to $51 billion in revenue, up 42% from 2023.\n\nSo what does this mean for how fairly valued the company is? If we look at its forward P/E, the company looks pretty solid at about 34. That's in line with much of big tech and is significantly lower than Nvidia's 48.\n\nBroadcom is a solid company, but it'll have trouble rivaling Nvidia\n\nBroadcom's growth prospects, while promising, just aren't comparable to Nvidia's, in my opinion. Nvidia is growing revenue at a pace that far outstrips Broadcom and doing it organically, not relying on costly acquisitions. Consensus estimates have Nvidia delivering more than twice the revenue growth of Broadcom by the end of this fiscal year and again next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd this disparity will be even greater in looking at net income. Look at the difference over the last year.\n\nAVGO Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not just the acquisition affecting this. Nvidia expects to operate with roughly 20% better margins this year than Broadcom.\n\nAside from the numbers, Nvidia demonstrated immense vision as a pioneer in AI. While difficult to quantify, I think visionary leadership is an factor that can't be underestimated. As the industry matures and competition heats up, Nvidia's leadership may help it maintain its top position.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, Broadcom is still a good investment with a solid track record and optimistic prospects. Is it the next Nvidia? I don't think so, but it doesn't need to be.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

This doesn't apply, however, if you are the parent of your spouse's child. Ex-spouses may also be eligible for spousal benefits if they were married for at least 10 years.\n\nSecond, you'll need to be at least 62 years old to claim spousal benefits with a couple of exceptions. If you provide care for a child age 16 or younger, the age requirement is waived. That's also the case if you provide care for a child age 17 or older with a disability who is entitled to receive Social Security dependent benefits based on your spouse's record.\n\nThird, your spousal benefit can't be higher than the amount you'd receive based on your own earnings history. If it isn't, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay you based on your own work record rather than your spouse's.\n\n2. Potential spousal benefit amount\n\nThe maximum spousal benefit is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the amount of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at their full retirement age. For anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.\n\nSpouses won't receive this maximum benefit, though, if they begin collecting benefits before their own full retirement age. The Social Security early retirement penalty will be imposed with benefits reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month up to 36 months before reaching full retirement age and five-twelfths of 1% for each month before then. However, if a spouse is providing care for a qualifying child, the spousal benefit won't be reduced.\n\nNote that the spousal benefit isn't based on when the higher-earning spouse begins collecting retirement benefits. If this spouse retires early or holds off until age 70, it won't change the amount of the spousal benefit. However, it would impact the survivor's benefit if he or she dies.\n\n3. Deemed filing\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made an important change often referred to as the \"deemed filing\" rule that affects Social Security spousal benefits. Deemed filing means when individuals file for spousal benefits, they also must file simultaneously for their own retirement benefits. In the past, people could file for spousal benefits before reaching their full retirement age but hold off on filing for their own retirement benefits until they reached full retirement age.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the deemed filing rule doesn't apply if you receive spousal benefits because you're providing care for your retired spouse's qualifying child. It also doesn't apply to survivor benefits. If your spouse dies, you can begin receiving Social Security survivor benefits without filing for your retirement benefit.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

        "body": "The time has finally come. On June 16, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) underwent a closely watched and historic 50-for-1 stock split. The previous four-figure price tag of the stock is currently at about $65.\n\nManagement felt this was the right proposal, given how well the restaurant company's shares have been performing. They're up 44% in 2024, and in the past five years, have soared 348%.\n\nIs this magnificent restaurant stock a no-brainer investment opportunity right after its 50-for-1 stock split?\n\nNo fundamental changes\n\nStock splits typically happen after a company's nominal share price gets too high. Of course, this is a good problem to have for Chipotle because it means the stock has done well for investors over the years. But by artificially cutting the price, the stock can be accessible to more investors.\n\nChipotle's outstanding share count expanded 50-fold to 1.4 billion. And the share price is now 1/50th what it was before this event. It's helpful to think of this situation as a pizza being cut into smaller slices.\n\nIt's really important to remember that from a fundamental perspective, nothing has changed with Chipotle. This is still the same business it was yesterday. Through its fast-casual stores, this company still sells Tex-Mex food like bowls and burritos.\n\nSince the executive team first announced the stock split in March, shares have climbed 17%. Perhaps the anticipation of this happening is precisely what has driven even greater bullish sentiment from the market.\n\nCurb your appetite\n\nAs we view the company and stock today to assess if Chipotle is a no-brainer investment opportunity, it's critical to consider the quality of the company. This is a stellar business.\n\nThe company continues to post strong financial results, despite ongoing macro headwinds. After revenue jumped 14.3% in 2023, it rose 14.1% in Q1 2024 (ended March 31). This was boosted by same-store sales growth of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new restaurants.\n\nChipotle is extremely profitable, which is supported by its proven pricing power. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 11.5%. And from a store-level perspective, 27.5% of revenue turned into operating profit in the first quarter, an outstanding figure.\n\nThere's still a lot of growth to be achieved. Management sees the potential to have 7,000 stores open in North America one day, roughly double the current footprint. This goal is higher than the previous target of 6,000, so it shows you that the leadership team is extremely optimistic about Chipotle's long-term prospects to further penetrate its key market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of these positive factors might make you believe that this stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity. However, consider just how high the expectations have gotten. It seems wild to me to pay a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 70.1 for the shares of this business. There's no margin of safety for investors should the company post quarterly financial results that the market isn't pleased with for whatever reason.\n\nOf course, unsustainable trends can last a lot longer than people might think. And this could be the case with Chipotle stock, as it has traded at a steep valuation for a while.\n\nNot only do I think the stock should be avoided, but I\u2019m also not comfortable calling this a no-brainer investment opportunity right now. Maybe if the P/E multiple dropped below 30, I'd adopt this view. This might not happen for a long time, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "How to Avoid the Social Security 'Tax Torpedo'",
        "body": "A senior couple dealing with unexpected Social Security taxes, commonly referred to as the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nWhile retirees may be chagrined to discover that taxes don\u2019t end when they leave the workforce, an unseen threat looms behind the U.S. tax code. The Social Security tax torpedo is as destructive as it sounds, blowing up the budgets of unsuspecting retired folks eagerly awaiting their first Social Security check. Having a clear understanding of your Social Security taxes could help you dodge this torpedo in retirement. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nA financial advisor can help you create a financial plan to minimize your taxes in your golden years.\n\nWhat Is Social Security Tax Torpedo?\n\nThe Social Security tax torpedo is a spike in taxes retirees can experience after receiving Social Security income. Specifically, 50% to 85% of your Social Security check may be taxable, depending on your income level and life circumstances. In addition, your Social Security income can increase your marginal tax rate, meaning the top portion of your income enters the next tax bracket. As a result, unsuspecting retirees can pay heavier taxes than anticipated, and their Social Security benefits provide less of a financial boost than expected.\n\nTax Torpedo Implications\n\nThe government bases your taxes in retirement on your modified adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable interest (usually from municipal bonds) and half of your Social Security benefits. The resulting sum is called your \u2018combined income,\u2019 which incurs different taxes depending on the amount and the filer\u2019s status.\n\nFor instance, single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. An income above this amount results in taxes on 85% of the benefits. Likewise, those married filing jointly with combined incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 will pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. Any amount above this incurs taxes on 85% of the benefits.\n\nRemember, the tax torpedo doesn\u2019t mean you will lose 85% of your Social Security income taxes. Instead, you\u2019ll owe your regular income tax rate on 85 cents of every dollar you receive from Social Security. In addition, your income tax rate isn\u2019t the same across all your income because of how tax brackets work. The US tax code incurs progressive taxes on your income the higher it is.\n\nFor example, say you\u2019re a single filer in 2023 with a total taxable income of $50,000 (putting you in the 22% tax rate for the income above $44,725). Your combined income is $35,000, and you receive $15,000 in Social Security benefits. You\u2019re over the $34,000 combined income limit, meaning you\u2019ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis situation means applying your top marginal tax rate (22%) to 85% of your Social Security benefit ($12,750). So, your tax burden from Social Security is a $2,805 expense. If your combined income was $34,000 or less, only half your Social Security would be taxed, a $1,650 expense.\n\nA financial advisor can help you navigate Social Security and the applicable taxes in your situation. Get matched with a financial advisor today.\n\nHow to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo\n\nA senior calculating his taxes to avoid the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nLosing your hard-earned Social Security benefits to Uncle Sam isn\u2019t a foregone conclusion. Here\u2019s how to sidestep the Social Security tax torpedo while maximizing your financial wellness and quality of life:\n\nUse a Roth IRA\n\nRoth IRAs are retirement accounts where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don\u2019t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the distributions during retirement are tax-free. As a result, your Roth IRA income doesn\u2019t count towards your taxable income, reducing the likelihood that you\u2019ll pass the threshold that determines whether 50% or 85% of your Social Security benefit is taxed.\n\nLive in a Tax-Friendly State\n\nThirteen states tax your Social Security check, adding to the federal tax burden. As a result, you can save on taxes by avoiding residency in the following states:\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nKansas\n\nMinnesota\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nRhode Island\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nGive Your IRA Income to Charity\n\nQualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow you to donate money directly from your traditional IRA to charity. The government doesn\u2019t count the first $100,000 of donations as taxable income. While doing so won\u2019t directly affect your Social Security tax, it will lower your overall taxable income, potentially reducing the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation. Remember, this advantage is solely for traditional IRAs.\n\nBuy a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)\n\nA QLAC is a specialized annuity that provides a guaranteed income stream later in life. You can transfer $130,000 from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a newly opened QLAC, reducing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you\u2019ll take from your retirement account. This way, the distributions from your 401(k) or IRA won\u2019t increase your annual income as much, mitigating Social Security taxes.\n\nYour QLAC has a delayed RMD age compared to traditional retirement accounts. While the government requires RMDs from a 401(k) or IRA at age 73, you can delay distributions from your QLAC until you\u2019re 85. Remember, you will owe taxes from QLAC distributions the year you receive them.\n\nCompare Your Income Level to Tax Brackets\n\nUnderstanding the income thresholds for different tax brackets can help you plan withdrawals from retirement accounts. By staying within lower tax brackets, you may reduce the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation.\n\nDelay Social Security\n\nTaxes on Social Security income can\u2019t apply until you receive your benefits. Therefore, delaying Social Security can help you avoid additional taxation through your 60s. If you can work or survive on other income until age 70, you\u2019ll reap two benefits: first, you\u2019ll maximize your Social Security payment amount. Second, you\u2019ll avoid paying taxes on Social Security. Plus, if you live on a traditional IRA or 401(k) during that time, you\u2019ll reduce your RMDs, giving you more control over your income level in your 70s.\n\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor if you're interested in building a tax-efficient retirement plan.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA senior surprised by unexpected taxes commonly known as the Social Security tax torpedo.\n\nUnderstanding and proactively addressing the possibility of a Social Security tax torpedo can increase your net income during retirement. By utilizing tools like Roth IRAs, charitable donations, and QLACs, you can create a more tax-efficient retirement.\n\nAdditionally, being mindful of how your income level relates to tax brackets and considering delaying Social Security can provide further avenues to optimize your financial well-being and quality of life in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can be instrumental in tailoring these strategies to your specific circumstances, helping you maximize your hard-earned retirement benefits.\n\nTips for Avoiding the Social Security Tax Torpedo\n\nConsulting a financial advisor is a crucial step in planning for retirement and avoiding the Social Security tax torpedo as you can get personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nPlanning during your working years makes a tax-efficient retirement more doable. However, if you\u2019re already retired, you can still lower your taxes and set yourself up for a brighter financial future.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Inside Creative House, \u00a9iStock.com/ljubaphoto, \u00a9iStock.com/smartstock\n\nThe post How to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.",

        "body": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.\n\nConstruction workers work on a new building partly covered with a large US flag on Sept. 25, 2013, in Los Angeles. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) (FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Will Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH) Recover? My Thoughts as a Soft-Drink Business Owner",
        "body": "Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has taken a hammering in recent months after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), quoting the latest Nielsen data, suggested that the growth-focused firm had lost market share. This has been compounded by additional data inferring that further incremental gains in the energy drinks market may be challenging. I\u2019m neutral on Celsius because despite liking the brand, the stock looks a little expensive to me.\n\nIs There a Market for Celsius?\n\nWhile I\u2019m actually a founder of my own health-focused soft drinks business, it\u2019s a million miles away from a company like Celsius. However, it\u2019s certainly interesting to see Celsius develop its niche and gain market share.\n\nCelsius positions itself as a healthier alternative to traditional soft drinks, offering beverages made with natural ingredients and caffeine sourced from nature. Emphasizing its commitment to healthy living, the company produces drinks without added sugars, aligning with current consumer trends.\n\nIn recent years, Celsius has capitalized on the growing demand for healthier beverage options. This is appealing to those seeking a more natural and refreshing way to stay energized and hydrated.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a caveat. Celsius replaces the sugar with things like the artificial sweetener sucralose. For context, when I made my health-focused soft drink \u2014 it\u2019s called Sumacqua \u2014 I decided I\u2019d rather have some sugar from natural sources like grape juice \u2014 which is high in polyphenols \u2014 rather than artificial ingredients.\n\nNonetheless, many people in the industry still see this as an improvement on traditional sugar-heavy canned drinks like cola, which are partially responsible for the widespread nature of diabetes. Celsius also claims to create metabolically positive drinks. These claims are only possible if you have the research to back it up.\n\nIn short, there appears to be great scope for growth. Celsius is operating in growing markets, with the healthy drinks market expected to grow from $344.36 billion in 2023 to $408.8 billion by 2028. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Celsius doesn\u2019t necessarily fall into this category; it is often referred to as an energy+ drink (an energy drink designed to boost metabolism and burn fat).\n\nData Turns on Celsius\n\nOn May 15, Morgan Stanley reported that Celsius saw a minor market share dip from 10.8% to 10.5% based on Nielsen data. In turn, this led to a swift sell-off and arguably one that was justified. At 100x earnings and 20x sales, the stock was priced for perfection. For context, I was told by private equity that if my business hit $1 million in sales in a year, it would be valued on a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of three to five.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Truist analyst Bill Chappell has suggested that while few companies make it above 10% market share, incremental gains from here on will be challenging. Chappell noted that further growth may necessitate converting loyal customers of Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Red Bull.\n\nWhat Do the Forecasts Say About Celsius?\n\nCelsius is expected to register earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 in 2024, and that then rises dramatically to $1.45 in 2025 and $1.99 in 2026. This is impressive growth for a company that\u2019s not operating in a fast-moving sector like technology or biotech. Looking beyond 2026, the number of analysts offering forecasts falls to just one. The singular analysts suggest that Celsius\u2019s EPS will rise to $4.84 by 2033.\n\nSo, what do these earnings projections mean for valuation metrics? Well, Celsius is currently trading at 51.69x non-GAAP forward earnings. This price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio then falls to 38.64x in 2025 and 28.07x in 2026. The TTM P/S ratio has fallen to 9.4x, and the forward ratio sits at 7.9x.\n\nAccording to the forecasts, earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of around 28.8% over the next five years. Given the 51.69x non-GAAP forward P/E, Celsius does look a little expensive. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 1.8x.\n\nIs Celsius Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CELH comes in as a Moderate Buy based on nine Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Celsius Holdings stock price target is $80.33, implying a 40.7% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Stock\n\nI like Celsius\u2019s brand, and I think they\u2019re taking the industry in the right direction. Very few companies have successfully taken on the soft drinks market with a healthier alternative to the legacy brands producing forms of lemonade and cola. However, I do wonder, as noted by Truist analyst Chappell, whether incremental gains will be harder to come by from here on.\n\nEqually, I believe the company is a little on the expensive side, even considering the strong earnings trajectory. This is highlighted by the PEG ratio of 1.8x. Personally, I\u2019m already over-invested in the sector, given my attempts to start my own soft drinks company. But if I weren\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t be investing in Celsius. While it\u2019s a promising company, I\u2019m neutral on the stock.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Is Up 190% So Far This Year. Can the Growth Continue in the Second Half of 2024?",
        "body": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has become one of the more dramatic and surprising companies in the stock market over the past year. The company existed for decades in obscurity, and its stock gained little traction for years after its 2007 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nHowever, a key partnership with Nvidia has changed the game for Supermicro (as the company is commonly called). Consequently, its stock is up 190% in the first half of this year. With its massive gains, investors are right to ask whether that momentum can continue through the second half of 2024.\n\nThe state of Supermicro\n\nSupermicro is a technology hardware company known for producing energy-saving, environmentally friendly tech products for the cloud, metaverse, and other applications. Its servers have gained the most attention, particularly those equipped with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Thanks to this partnership, its profits and stock price have grown exponentially.\n\nAs recently as four years ago, its stock traded for about $24 per share. This year, its recent growth has been so dramatic that analysts predict nearly $24 per share for Supermicro's net income! Not surprisingly, such improvements have led to a 3,400% gain in the tech stock's price since 2020.\n\nSMCI Chart\n\nA Market.us study seems to confirm this trend. It predicts that the AI server industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% through 2033, transforming what was a $31 billion industry last year into one worth $430 billion by 2033.\n\nCan the growth continue?\n\nEven the most dedicated Supermicro bulls should not expect another 3,400% gain over the next four-and-a-half years. While an additional 190% gain in six months is far from guaranteed, that move is not out of the question when one looks at the financials. In the nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), its net sales of $9.6 billion rose 95% from year-ago levels. Its cost of sales grew at a slightly faster 102%.\n\nConsequently, its net income of $855 million grew 92% over the same period. Also, with consensus estimates pointing to a 102% increase in net income for the fiscal year, its earnings are rising fast enough for the stock to maintain a rapid growth pace.\n\nAdditionally, despite surging profits and massive stock price growth, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 and its forward P/E ratio is 36. This is less than some of the faster-growing tech stalwarts such as Nvidia and Amazon, indicating it could sustain the multiple expansions needed to take the stock price much higher, possibly enough to maintain the current growth pace for another six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro in the second half of 2024\n\nGiven its business and financial conditions, a 190% gain for the second half of this year is a plausible scenario. Admittedly, the market makes no guarantees, and ultimately, investors should not expect a 190% move higher by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, demand for the company's servers is likely to continue rising, possibly enough to sustain near triple-digit revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nAt its current valuation, a 190% increase in the stock price would give it an expensive, but not record-breaking P/E ratio. Hence, even if it falls short of that ambitious goal, Supermicro could still deliver significant returns for the rest of the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Walgreens Stock Collapses on Weak Outlook. Is Now the Time to Buy?",
        "body": "Share prices of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) plunged following the June 27 release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, with the stock having one of its worst days on record. The stock price has now fallen more than 53% since the start of 2024.\n\nLet's look at Walgreens' most recent quarterly report, why the stock plummeted, and whether now is the time to buy.\n\nReduced guidance, store closures, and new plan\n\nFor its fiscal Q3 (ended in May), Walgreens saw its revenue rise 2.6% year over year to $36.4 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 36.5% to $0.63. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 2.3% year over year, with same-store sales up 3.5%. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 5.7%, while comparable retail sales were down 2.3%. Adjusted operating income plunged 47.9% year over year to $501 million, hurt by weak retail sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures.\n\nInternational sales rose 2.8% year over year. Boots UK sales grew 1.6%, with retail same-store sales up 6% and pharmacy same-store sales up 5.8%. Adjusted operating income slid 15.8% year over year to $175 million.\n\nRevenue from its U.S. healthcare segment rose 7.6% year over year to $2.1 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $23 million, an improvement from negative $113 million a year ago. VillageMD revenue grew 7% year over year, while Shields revenue jumped 24%.\n\nGross margins fell to 17.8% from 18.6% a year ago. Gross margins in its U.S. retail pharmacy business fell to 17.7% from 19.1%. This shows how the company continues to get squeezed from pharmacy benefit managers over drug prices.\n\nWalgreens generated negative $314 million in operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year and negative $1.4 billion in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in debt and $703 million in cash.\n\nLooking ahead, the company reduced its fiscal full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.80 to $2.95 from a prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35. Management expects the challenging consumer environment and muted script volume growth it is seeing to continue into 2025.\n\nAs a result, the company plans to close a \"significant portion\" of its 8,700 U.S. locations over the next three years, with it set to examine about 25% of its unprofitable locations. The company also said it will make investments to improve customer and patient experience, such as accelerating its digital and omnichannel offerings, building its loyalty program, and reducing the number of brands and SKUs on its shelves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also plans to reduce its stake in VillageMD and no longer be its majority owner. However, it plans to keep its positions in Shields and Boots UK.\n\nThe company also remains in talks with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health issuers about creating a better reimbursement system that will help stabilize its pharmacy margins and ensure fair payment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs this dip an opportunity to buy the stock?\n\nReimbursement rate pressures that continue to hurt Walgreens' margins and lower profitably remain its biggest problem. Shifting to a cost-plus model, where it would get additional payments when it can help slow the inflationary costs on drug prices, would greatly benefit the company. It would also help relieve the constant drug reimbursement pressure it has seen year in and year out.\n\nHowever, while Walgreens is actively working with PBMs and other payers to change the model, this won't happen overnight. And the PBMs have clearly shown that they hold the upper hand.\n\nIn the meantime, it is a good idea to sell off some of its VillageMD stake, as this was a failed investment idea that stemmed from the company's previous management team. Closing unprofitable stores is also the right move. Walgreen's balance sheet is loaded with debt, so paying off debt and returning to positive free cash flow is a priority.\n\nTrading at about a 4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Walgreens finds itself in the bargain bin. However, its debt load, lack of operating cash flow generation, and weakening operating performance are reasons the stock is trading at the current levels.\n\nWBA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFor patient investors, Walgreens is worth taking a chance on at current levels. The stock is cheap, and the company's new CEO is now looking to make his imprint on the pharmacy giant.

        "body": "While many investors want the stocks that they own to soar in price over time, there are some market participants who appreciate the passive income that their holdings throw off on a consistent basis. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) might catch the attention of these folks.\n\nThe world's leading coffee enterprise has paid a steadily rising dividend since 2010. The current yield sits at a healthy 2.9%. The only issue is that this stock is down 37% from its peak price, which was hit in July 2021.\n\nMight Starbucks shares be ready to skyrocket again?\n\nHitting a rough patch\n\nThe company's stock performance in recent years might cause you to scratch your head. That's because fiscal 2023 revenue of $36 billion was 24% higher than the coffee chain generated in 2021, with operating income up 21% over that two-year stretch. Unsurprisingly, the business took a hit during the pandemic's height, but it has since been on a solid recovery path.\n\nHowever, shares have been on a downswing in the past 14 months, and they immediately dipped 16% following the second-quarter 2024 (ended March 31) financial update. It's not hard to figure out why.\n\nDuring the 13-week period, same-store sales declined 3% in the U.S., which is the company's most important market. This was driven by a troubling 7% drop in transaction counts. In the huge China market, it's a worse situation as same-store sales tanked 11%. CEO Laxman Narasimhan called this a \"challenging operating environment\" as consumers become more selective with their spending.\n\nScaring investors even more was the fact that management lowered guidance for fiscal 2024. It now expects revenue to increase by low single digits, down from a prior range of 7% to 10%.\n\nFavorable qualities\n\nIt's not encouraging for shareholders to see Starbucks in this state. But for long-term investors, it's important to stay focused on the company's favorable qualities, of which there are many.\n\nFor starters, Starbucks has a wide economic moat, stemming from its brand strength, that protects its competitive position. There is something about Starbucks that has differentiated it and allowed it to resonate with consumers. It's hard to quantify a brand's status. But I think the fact that the company has typically been able to grow same-store sales through higher prices and foot traffic over long stretches of time demonstrates it has something special.\n\nPlus, it helps that Starbucks' average gross margin over the past 10 years, for example, is a superb 28.2%. This might go overlooked, but Starbucks is a consistently profitable and financially sound enterprise. Ongoing positive earnings and free cash flow are precisely what help the business fund its dividend payouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the expansion isn't finished. As of March 31, there were nearly 39,000 Starbucks locations scattered across the globe. That's a ridiculously large figure. However, management believes there is still a sizable growth runway going forward. By 2030, the goal is to have a whopping 55,000 locations open, at which point sales and earnings will be much higher than they are today.\n\nLow market expectations\n\nInvestors have clearly soured on Starbucks. The shares have taken a hit because there's uncertainty as to when things will start to improve.\n\nBut this pessimism creates a buying opportunity for those who can look out over the next three to five years. Starbucks trades at a price-to-sales ratio of under 2.5 right now. Shares have basically never been cheaper in the past decade.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not entirely sure that the stock will skyrocket. However, based on the company's positive attributes, I'm optimistic about this investment working out well for buyers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Rivian Soars After Volkswagen Investment. Is It Too Late to Buy the Stock?",
        "body": "Share prices of Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) surged higher after the maker of electric vehicles (EV) received a sizeable investment from German automaker Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY). Despite the recent price gains, the stock is still down nearly 43% in 2024.\n\nLet's look at the importance of this investment, how it could help Rivian, and if it is too late to buy the stock.\n\nVolkswagen investment\n\nVolkswagen announced it will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian over three years as well as form a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between the companies. Volkswagen will initially invest $1 billion in the company in the form of a convertible note, which will convert to Rivian shares once it receives regulatory approvals, but not before Dec. 1, 2024.\n\nIf the JV is approved, the German automaker would look to invest another $4 billion into Rivian or the JV by 2026, including another $1 billion this year upon the implementation of the JV. The purpose of the JV will be to develop next-generation electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture for EVs.\n\nFor the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license. The formation of the JV will also allow Volkswagen to use Rivian's current electronic architecture in its own vehicles, which includes its new zonal hardware design.\n\nFor Volkswagen, the deal brings with it immediate access to much-needed technology to develop its next generation of EVs. Rivian is one of the few non-Chinese automakers outside of Tesla so far to develop zonal architecture.\n\nFor Rivian, meanwhile, this is a huge cash infusion that will allow the company to continue to scale its business. Along with the current $7.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, this should give Rivian ample room to ramp up production of its lower-priced R2 SUV models at its Illinois plant, as well as build out its planned $5 billion manufacturing campus in Georgia, which it temporarily paused construction on earlier this year.\n\nVolkswagen will also lend some of its manufacturing expertise, which can help Rivian continue to cut manufacturing costs. Rivian has done a great job creating popular luxury electric SUVs, but it has not been able to sell them for a profit, losing money on each vehicle it sells. At its investor day following the Volkswagen announcement, the company spent much of its time discussing reducing the costs of its vehicles so it could obtain a positive gross margin.\n\nThe company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin. It is also looking for a 10% free cash flow margin and a high-teens adjusted profit margin over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it too late to buy the stock?\n\nThe Volkswagen investment, if the JV is approved, should give Rivian the cash it needs to scale its business and make it viable. Negative gross margins and cash flow have been its biggest issues, but the company has made aggressive steps to reduce the cost of its vehicles and improve its manufacturing process.\n\nThe development of its zonal architecture, meanwhile, has not only greatly improved the cost structure of its vehicles, but has also proven to be a highly valuable technology that Volkswagen was willing to pay a lot of money to get access to for use in its vehicles.\n\nThe deal now gives Rivian two very large powerful investors and partners in Volkswagen and Amazon, for whom it has a deal in place to make Amazon's electric van fleet.\n\nRivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin. However, the deal with Volkswagen helped remove a lot of the liquidity risk associated with the company. As such, the stock looks more attractive from a risk-reward basis after its recent run-up than before the deal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "The tech bull market sparked by innovations in generative AI in 2023 continued in the first half of 2024. Even when focusing on tech broadly rather than the industry's strongest performers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index yielded a total return of nearly 19%.\n\nKnowing that, investors may wonder which stocks could lead the way in the second half of the year. While the market offers no guarantees, the last two quarters of the year could be the time when some stocks begin to rise in earnest. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors deliver insights on stocks they believe investors should watch for the remainder of the year.\n\nAlphabet is positioned to leverage its search-market dominance into AI riches\n\nJake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. What I really like about Alphabet is that the company combines two of the most critical features of any outstanding stock: potential, best represented by its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and results, as seen in its consistent financial performance.\n\nLet's examine its potential first. Regarding AI, the sky is the limit for Alphabet. The company's latest AI-powered personal assistant, Google Assistant, offers many features to help people accomplish more. Through voice commands alone, users can:\n\nSet timers, create lists, and save locations and passwords.\n\nCall, text, and read emails aloud.\n\nGather local information, such as weather, traffic, and directions.\n\nAnswer general questions, such as \"how many grams in an ounce\" or \"what is 18% of $57.\"\n\nFind and play music, movies, or podcasts.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet can capitalize on its massive user base. As the most-visited website in the world, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day -- about one for every person on the planet. As such, Alphabet has a significant opportunity to make Google Assistant the preferred AI assistant. This could lead to substantial benefits for Alphabet in the future as it explores ways to monetize Google Assistant through a subscription model where users pay a monthly fee for premium features or an advertising model where companies pay to have their products or services recommended by the assistant.\n\nIn the meantime, Alphabet can rely on its already established businesses, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android, to keep \"bringing home the bacon.\" These businesses show consistent growth and profitability, adding to Alphabet's overall stability and investment potential.\n\nTo sum up, Alphabet could be the AI stock to watch in the back half of 2024 -- and beyond. Investors seeking a stock with an unbeatable combination of potential and results would be wise to consider it.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta stock isn't done riding the AI wave\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been on a rocket-like trajectory. Shares have risen 45% since January and are up an astonishing 326% since January 2023 when artificial intelligence began picking up steam. In just 18 months, Meta stock created the magnitude of wealth the broader market generally takes decades to achieve. I understand if people feel skeptical that Meta has more in the tank.\n\nYet, the fundamentals indicate that Meta could ride its current momentum through the latter half of this year. That's driven primarily by strong operating performance and a stock valuation that's still borderline cheap. Meta's core business is advertising to its billions of social media users. Meta impressively still gains users even though so many people already use its apps. Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew to 3.24 billion daily active users in the first quarter, a 7% year-over-year jump.\n\nDigital advertising continues to take market share away from older media formats like television and print, so Meta is also enjoying tailwinds there. Meta's ad volume was up 20% year over year in Q1. Lastly, Meta has started using AI to help companies advertise more efficiently, which helped increase Meta's price per ad by 6% in Q1. In other words, Meta benefits from multiple variables boosting its primary business.\n\nInvestors will need to see how Meta continues to perform in future quarters. Analysts are very optimistic; 2024 earnings-per-share estimates of $20.16 would represent 35.5% growth over 2023. Meanwhile, analysts believe Meta will grow earnings by an average of over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Given that healthy growth outlook, Meta stock remains arguably cheap at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.\n\nMeta is a world-class business that experienced severe adversity in 2022. The comeback has created eye-popping returns. While Meta's meteoric rise means there's probably far less upside than before, investors shouldn't jump ship too soon. There is still plenty of wind in its sails.\n\nIn the AI chip space, a rising tide could lift AMD\n\nWill Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): Given Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space, potential competitors are easy to dismiss at first glance.\n\nHowever, according to Allied Market Research, the AI chip industry is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. With Nvidia apparently struggling to meet current demand, it leaves an opening for competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nEven though Nvidia leads in the innovation battle, AMD has a history of catching up to and sometimes surpassing its competitors. Moreover, while a Nvidia AI chip costs around $30,000 to $40,000, AMD's $10,000 to $15,000 semiconductors will likely appeal to customers who are anxious to snap up any AI chips they can find.\n\nMore recently, investors largely overlooked AMD as its revenue of $5.5 billion in Q1 2024 grew by only 2% yearly. However, data-center revenue of $2.3 billion rose 80% over the same period. Moreover, it made up 42% of the company's overall revenue, a level comparable to Nvidia's percentage of data-center revenue at the end of fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) of 39%.\n\nFast forward to fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended April 28), and 87% of Nvidia's revenue came from its data center segment. With AMD's aforementioned 80% data-center growth, Nvidia's recent history shows how AMD could follow in its footsteps as AI chips become its dominant source of revenue.\n\nAlso, thanks mostly to AI chips, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% yearly in that quarter. Although AMD may or may not match that number over time, Nvidia's recent history describes what could happen to AMD's revenue growth as its AI chip sales accelerate.\n\nAdditionally, AMD holds a significant valuation advantage if looking beyond its misleading P/E ratio of 232. The company currently trades at a price-to-book value ratio of around 4.5. In comparison, Nvidia sells at 63 times its book value. This differential makes AMD stock a relative bargain, giving the stock room to run as the sale of AI chips becomes a more critical revenue stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Stocks have been on the rise this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% year to date. The index is on track to outperform last year's growth, as the S&P 500 rose 13% over the same period (January to June) in 2023.\n\nWall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks thanks to advances in fields like artificial intelligence (AI). The same was true this time last year. However, the key difference is there have now been several quarters of tangible results that prove AI is truly boosting earnings for several companies and is a worthy venture.\n\nHowever, tech is a lot more than AI. The industry covers countless sectors that will likely keep it expanding for decades. As a result, it could be a good idea to make a considerable investment in companies with exposure to AI and other areas of tech. Innovative organizations that lead critical parts of the industry could deliver major gains over the long term as the tech market expands.\n\nSo, are you looking to invest $50,000 in the stock market? Here are two of the best stocks that money can buy in 2024 (and are even worth buying with a smaller investment).\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded over the last year as it has become a leader in AI. Its chips have become the gold standard in the industry, coveted by developers worldwide. As a result, the company's stock is up 196% year over year, driven primarily by excitement over AI. However, as a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets outside of AI that could further boost its business for years.\n\nBefore the recent boom in AI, Nvidia was best known for its prominent role in gaming. The company was one of the first to sell graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer market, which gamers use to custom-build high-powered gaming PCs. Nvidia's success in the industry gave it the financial resources to branch out to other tech sectors like data centers, game consoles, consumer products, self-driving cars, and AI.\n\nIncreased interest in AI kicked off at the start of last year. However, Nvidia was a promising growth stock long before that, with its share price rising 338% in the five years leading up to 2023. AI has only strengthened Nvidia's outlook and worth as a long-term investment.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025 (ending April 2024), Nvidia's revenue climbed 262% year over year, fueled mainly by a 427% increase in its data center segment (representing a rise in AI GPU sales). However, the company also saw encouraging growth in gaming and automotive, where revenue rose 18% and 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe automotive segment includes income from chips supplied to companies leading the way in self-driving technology. The market is still in its infancy but could be a major growth catalyst as chip demand rises alongside the expanding industry.\n\nIn addition to massive growth potential across tech, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) is less than 1, indicating its stock remains a value play despite recent growth. At its current position, an investment of $25,000 would secure roughly 201 shares in Nvidia -- significantly more than a few months ago, thanks to a recent stock split.\n\nAt this price, the company is screaming buy this year for long-term-minded investors.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has significantly expanded its reach in tech. Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has ventured into and eventually dominated multiple industries, including e-commerce, video streaming, and cloud computing.\n\nIt's as if the company can do no wrong, with solid leadership and vast financial resources that allow it to expand and overcome unexpected hurdles. As a result, its stock is a compelling option as it continues to see gains in retail and develops its roles in AI and digital ads.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's revenue popped 13% year over year. The company profited from massive gains in operating income, more than tripling since last year to $15 billion thanks to growth in its retail segments and highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nMoreover, the quarter signaled a budding business for the company, with revenue from advertising services jumping 24% after the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service. Amazon has a competitive edge in the industry with a leading market share in streaming. This could allow it to dominate the developing streaming advertising market in the coming years, further diversifying Amazon's business.\n\nA $25,000 investment would buy roughly 130 shares in Amazon at its current price. The company's stock has climbed more than 100% over the last five years but could outperform that figure as it continues to expand in AI and other areas of tech. Like Nvidia, Amazon's PEG is also less than 1, making its stock just too good to pass up in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Roku Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "Once a pandemic darling that was making its investors rich, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has come crashing back toward Earth. The shares trade 88% below their all-time high, which was established in July 2021.\n\nBut don't let that distract you from the actual business. This leading streaming platform has some positive attributes that investors should know and appreciate.\n\nHere are three reasons to buy Roku like there's no tomorrow -- and that's on top of the fact that the stock trades at a cheap price-to-sales multiple.\n\n\n\nKey metrics\n\nThe first reason to scoop up shares stems from its strong performance metrics. In the first three months of 2024, the business reported a 19% year-over-year revenue jump. And this was after revenue rose 11% in 2023.\n\nWhat's more, the user base continues to expand. As of March 31, Roku had 81.6 million active accounts. That figure was up from 80 million at the end of last year. And it represented an impressive 14% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. This wide reach gives Roku top market share in the smart-TV market in North America.\n\nEngagement shows no signs of weakness. In Q1, a whopping 30.8 billion hours of content was watched on the Roku platform. That number has continued to go up steadily with each passing quarter.\n\nOne area that might worry investors is Roku's monetization trends. Average revenue per user totaled $40.65 in the first quarter. While this was down from six months ago, it does appear to be stabilizing.\n\nIndustry position\n\nIt's been interesting to watch the changing media landscape over the past several years. From an investor's perspective, it can be confusing trying to understand what's happening. The good news, though, is that Roku looks to be well positioned in the industry.\n\nIt benefits from the cord-cutting trend, as consumers cancel their traditional cable-TV packages and move fully to streaming. In the U.S., less than half of all households still have their cable subscriptions. And the percentage is expected to keep declining going forward.\n\nGiven the multitude of streaming services available, having a single user interface that combines these content offerings drastically improves the viewing experience. This is where Roku's value proposition speaks for itself.\n\nRoku is able to grow its business because of the billions of dollars that are spent by content companies like Netflix and Walt Disney. By aiming to be an agnostic platform that provides broad distribution capabilities to content providers, Roku stands to gain from the rise of streaming with more accounts signing up over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAd market\n\nRapidly rising interest rates in 2022 dampened the perspective on the economy. This resulted in marketing executives paring back their ad budgets in the anticipation that a recession would happen and that consumer spending would be under pressure. But this didn't become a reality.\n\nRoku's platform segment, which enters into advertising revenue deals with its content partners, grew sales by 19% in Q1 to $755 million, representing 86% of the company total. This double-digit growth is very encouraging to see.\n\n\"The year-over-year growth of video advertising across the Roku platform outperformed both the overall ad market and the traditional linear TV ad market in the U.S.,\" Roku's CEO and CFO wrote in the Q1 2024 shareholder letter.\n\nOver time, there's a huge opportunity for Roku to become an even bigger force. Consumers are spending more and more time watching streaming services. As ad dollars catch up, flowing from traditional cable TV, Roku looks like it is going to continue being a big beneficiary. And this supports the prospects of solid top-line growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These Undervalued ETFs Instead",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen the value of its shares skyrocket over the past two years as the biggest chip supplier in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy.\n\nSeveral hedge fund managers spotted the potential for Nvidia in AI early and made considerable bets on the semiconductor stock. Stan Druckenmiller accumulated a sizable position in the stock in late 2022 and early 2023 as OpenAI's ChatGPT took the world by storm. At one point, Nvidia stock accounted for 16% of his portfolio. David Tepper, owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers, likewise built a huge position in the stock in the first half of 2023.\n\nBut billionaires, as a group, have started selling off their Nvidia shares. That's in large part due to the incredible run the stock has been on. It's up over 160% this year already, and it was briefly the most valuable company in the world.\n\nHere are some of the billionaires selling their positions in Nvidia:\n\nStan Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office) sold 441,551 shares and all 4,895 call options, reducing his total exposure to the stock by about 84%.\n\nPhilippe Laffont (Coatue Management) sold 2.9 million shares, cutting his position by 68%.\n\nDavid Tepper (Appaloosa) sold 348,000 shares, trimming his position by 44%.\n\nIsrael Englander (Millennium Management) sold 720,004 shares and 6,910 calls, cutting his bullish position by about one-third. He also trimmed Millennium's put options, but by less than 20%, leaning more bearish.\n\nBillionaires are smart to take some of their money off the table and reinvest into other assets as a way to diversify their portfolios and potentially find the next big winners. The ones listed above put a lot of the money from selling Nvidia into some undervalued exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that both diversify away from Nvidia and provide a lot of potential upside.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBetting big on small stocks\n\nBoth Druckenmiller and Englander added exposure to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT: IWM). It tracks the Russell 2000 index, which is the most commonly used index for small-cap stocks.\n\nDruckenmiller bought 31,579 call options on the ETF, which had a total value of $664 million as of the end of the first quarter. That makes the ETF his largest position, representing 15% of his portfolio. Englander, meanwhile, pared back on puts while adding a substantial number of calls and shares of the ETF itself.\n\nThere's good reason to be more bullish on small caps these days. While large-cap stocks like those found in the S&P 500 have fully recovered from the 2022 bear market, small-cap stocks like those in the Russell 2000 or S&P 600 aren't back to all-time highs. The current high interest rates are much more challenging for small caps, which often rely on revolving debt to fund their growth instead of long-term bonds or existing cash flows.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, the valuation of small-cap stocks remains depressed relative to the large-cap market. The gap between the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and the S&P 600 is the largest it's been since 2001. That could make it a stellar opportunity to invest in small-cap stocks right now. Druckenmiller is going big, and Englander is also coming around to the idea.\n\nFinding value in China\n\nTepper and Laffont are looking to the world's second-largest economy for investment opportunities. Both added shares of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI). It tracks the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index, which follows 50 of the largest and most liquid Chinese companies trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nTepper bought 6.4 million shares of the ETF, which had a value of $153.4 million as of the end of the first quarter, representing about 2.3% of his portfolio. Laffont added 2.1 million shares, worth about $50 million, or 0.2% of Coatue's portfolio.\n\nTepper is extremely bullish on China, adding many large-cap tech names from the country last quarter, including Alibaba Group, Baidu, PDD Holdings, and JD.com. Most can be found in the iShares ETF.\n\nChina was slow to reopen as COVID-19 pressures eased, and it now faces a property crisis, slow economic growth, and deflation as consumers slow their spending. It also faces political tensions. Stock prices declined for a third consecutive year in 2023. While prices have recovered somewhat in 2024, the China Large-Cap ETF is still down nearly 50% from the all-time high reached in early 2021.\n\nBut the tide might be turning for China. Pandemic-related restrictions have eased up, and the government is enacting stimulus measures to support the property sector and get Chinese consumers spending again. The efforts began in earnest in February, and the impact on the stock market is evident. Tepper and Laffont's new favorite ETF is up 22% since the start of February.\n\nConsidering how far Chinese stocks have fallen, there's still a long way for them to come back. Valuations remain attractive, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how strongly China can rebound. With the attractive prices for some of the leading names in their industries, however, it could be worth taking a closer look at the Chinese stock ETF.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "SoundHound AI Is the Most Undervalued Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Now",
        "body": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has had quite the roller-coaster ride this year. But there's more excitement ahead, and I say it's time to buckle up for the next climb.\n\nDespite its negative earnings and eyebrow-raising valuation ratios, SoundHound AI stands out as a diamond in the rough. The voice-control specialist's stock is currently down by a significant margin from its previous highs, but don't let that discourage you. Here's why I see a big future for this little artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse, and why I'd still call it \"undervalued\" today.\n\nA closer look at SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI focuses on voice AI and conversational intelligence technologies, fields that are becoming increasingly vital in our tech-driven world. With a backlog of long-term contracts totaling a whopping $682 million, this company has a clear path to future income that seems largely ignored by the current market price.\n\nYes, the stock has more than doubled from early February, when AI giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a small investment in SoundHound AI stock. But it stands far below the nearly $14 peak price recorded shortly after the initial public offering (IPO) in the inflation-burdened spring of 2022.\n\nThe market buzz around Nvidia's investment was more than hype, by the way. It was a nod from a proven tech giant recognizing SoundHound AI's long-term potential. While the stock has since cooled off, the company's fundamentals are anything but frosty.\n\nFinancial metrics and growth prospects\n\nDespite its current unprofitability and high valuation ratios, SoundHound AI's financial health remains robust. The order backlog mentioned above amounts to nearly $700 million as of Q1 2024, up from $336 million in the year-ago period. This backlog reflects committed client contracts and realistic adoption estimates for subscription services, providing a solid foundation for future revenue.\n\nA skyrocketing balance in this column suggests that customer interest for SoundHound AI's services is high and rising, and the backlog should convert into revenues over time. The stock is worth about 1.9 times that backlog today.\n\nComparing backlog to price-to-sales ratios can be misleading because backlog represents future potential revenue, whereas price-to-sales is based on current revenue.\n\nSo it's not an entirely fair apples-to-apples comparison to price-to-sales figures, where this stock looks expensive with a 25.5x multiple -- it should take years to complete the revenue-generating services. Still, most growth stocks would sell their proverbial mothers for a backlog like that.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, SoundHound's comes with a robust financial base. With a cash balance of $180 million and only $85.5 million of long-term debt, SoundHound is well-equipped to continue its growth trajectory. This solid foundation is crucial to the hypergrowth phase of a hungry upstart, allowing the company to take bottom-line losses while optimizing its top-line growth trajectory. In other words, that massive order backlog wouldn't be what it is without SoundHound AI's willingness to finance this business stage through debt papers and open-market stock sales.\n\nPositioned for long-term growth\n\nSoundHound AI might seem like a wild ride, but that's part of its charm. Sure, the stock has taken some steep dives, but the fundamentals paint a promising picture. The company's backlog of long-term contracts is substantial, and its strategic moves have positioned it well for future growth.\n\nInvestors should be prepared for a bumpy journey, but the potential rewards should be worth the uncomfortable ride. SoundHound AI's innovative technology, coupled with its impressive backlog, suggests that this growth story is just getting started -- nearly two decades after the company's founding.\n\nFor those willing to embrace a bit of excitement and hold on through the twists and turns, SoundHound AI could be the ticket to market-beating returns. It's not a classic value stock, but it's hard to find a better buy in the overheated AI sector right now. I'd certainly buy SoundHound AI stock long before doubling down on Nvidia's lofty valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Vanguard's Top ETF Is Up 24% This Year. Here's Another ETF Up Twice As Much.",
        "body": "There's a good reason why Warren Buffett likes Vanguard funds. Vanguard, led by (the late) Jack Bogle, pioneered and popularized investing in index funds. Vanguard's funds are known for their low costs.\n\nThose low expense ratios wouldn't mean much, though, if Vanguard's funds didn't perform well. The good news is that many of them do. Vanguard's top exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 24% this year. But there's another ETF up twice as much.\n\nBeating Vanguard's best\n\nVanguard offers 86 ETFs. One has outperformed all others in 2024: The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG). This ETF has jumped 24% this year following an impressive 28% gain in 2023.\n\nMost investors would probably be happy with these returns. However, those who want even bigger gains might want to check out the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This ETF has soared a whopping 48% year to date.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is managed by global investment manager VanEck. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. As its name reflects, this index includes companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThis year's big returns aren't a fluke for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. It has delivered an average annual return of 38.6% over the last five years. Since the fund's inception in December 2011, its average annual return is 26.5%. By comparison, the Vanguard S&P Growth Index Fund ETF is up 16.6% over the last five years and 15.7% since its inception in September 2010.\n\nWhy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is soaring\n\nYou can probably make a good guess as to why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is performing so well this year. Chip stocks are sizzling hot thanks primarily to surging demand for servers for training and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\nThis VanEck ETF owns only 26 stocks. The top five holdings make up over 50% of its total portfolio. When these stocks move higher, so does the ETF's price. And they've moved a lot higher so far in 2024.\n\nThe fund's largest holding is Nvidia, which comprises 20.4% of its total assets. Nvidia's share price has exploded 150% higher this year. Customers can't get enough of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in supporting AI models.\n\nAnother 12.9% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is invested in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company makes chips designed by leading customers including Nvidia. Its stock is up 65% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoughly 7.7% of the fund's portfolio is in Broadcom. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Its shares have jumped more than 40% in 2024.\n\nThe VanEck ETF's fourth- and fifth-largest positions are Advanced Micro Devices and ASML Holding with 4.97% and 4.8%, respectively, of the fund's net assets. Advanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's top rivals. Its stock is up only around 8% this year. Meanwhile, shares of semiconductor fabrication equipment maker ASML have risen over 35%.\n\nShould you buy this high-flying ETF?\n\nRisk-averse investors should probably stay away from the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. When it falls, it falls hard. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, the ETF plunged 24%. The fund also trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings ratio of over 39 for the stocks in its portfolio.\n\nHowever, aggressive investors who want to own a basket of semiconductor stocks should consider buying the ETF. AI should continue to provide a strong tailwind for these stocks. The VanEck ETF's annual expense ratio is 0.35%, higher than Vanguard's top ETF this year but still not too expensive. Also, Morningstar gives the VanEck Semiconductor ETF a five-star rating (the highest possible).\n\nAs far as I know, Buffett has never recommended VanEck as he has Vanguard. He doesn't own any VanEck ETFs. But with the pluses of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, maybe he should.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Tesla Stock?",
        "body": "Since hitting a peak in 2021, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has struggled to build much, if any, momentum. Once trading at more than $400 per share, the stock has been beaten up for the last three years and currently sits at around $185.\n\nWhile those who invested before 2021 are likely sitting on comfortable gains, those who've invested more recently may not be so fortunate. Perhaps Tesla's best days have already passed, begging the question: Is it too late to invest in Tesla?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nExplaining Tesla's fall\n\nTesla's stock dip can largely be attributed to dwindling gross-profit margins. At its peak, Tesla's margins were above 30%, easily the best in the entire auto industry. Today, those margins have receded to 17% which, although still near the top, now face a number of pressures.\n\nThe reason for this decline is varied but can be boiled down to a reduction in consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs). Higher interest rates have dissuaded would-be buyers due to the increased costs of financing a vehicle. In an attempt to stimulate demand, Tesla decided to cut prices in 2023. This, combined with higher costs across supply chains and labor markets, caused margins to tumble.\n\nTSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, interest rates will fall eventually, and demand for EVs are likely to rebound as these factors are typically cyclical. Current trends suggest that rates may start to finally decrease by year's end. Naturally, as borrowing becomes cheaper, consumer demand for EVs should rebound.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla stands to benefit from the overall trend in EV adoption around the world. Governments are implementing stricter emissions regulations and offering incentives to encourage EV purchases, creating a supportive environment for Tesla's long-term growth.\n\nPlus, the company is expanding internationally with construction of a factory in Mexico underway and plans to enter India and Thailand in the coming years.\n\nA new Tesla takes shape\n\nTesla is striving to become more than just an EV company. One of its key efforts right now is building out autonomous vehicles and eventually launching a robotaxi business. Tesla's self-driving technology has made significant strides, and the company is preparing for a worldwide demo of its robotaxi on Aug. 8.\n\nIn addition to autonomous vehicles, Tesla is also in the midst of getting its humanoid robot, Optimus, ready for market launch, which is anticipated to happen in 2025. While these endeavors are not yet ready for widespread commercial release, Tesla has made notable progress. Optimus is already being used in Tesla factories, showcasing its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs across all kinds of industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking the optimistic route\n\nCritics will point out that Tesla and deadlines don't always mix well. But it is difficult to contend with its ability to eventually follow through. If Tesla can replicate similar levels of success in its robotaxis and Optimus as it has with its EVs, it could transform the company and maybe even society for the better.\n\nWhile it is difficult to measure the true monetary impact that these two innovations will have simply because no such market exists for these types of products, some estimates put the total revenue of robotaxis at $700 billion a year and Optimus at around $1 trillion. Combined, and if accurate, that means the two would more than triple Tesla's current revenue.\n\nAt the risk of being optimistic, I believe Tesla's best days remain ahead and that it isn't too late to invest in one of the most transformative companies of the future. Tesla's ability to innovate and push the boundaries of technology has been a key driver of its success thus far. If it can continue to lead in the EV market while successfully expanding into new areas like autonomous vehicles and robotics, the company could soar to even greater heights.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "This Stock Market Indicator Has Been 86% Accurate Since 1984, and It Signals a Big Move in the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 14.5% in the first half of 2024. That momentum was initially driven by rate-cut hopes. Investors entered the year thinking the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate six times. But sticky inflation reset those expectations. The market now anticipates just two cuts later this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nFortunately, enthusiasm about artificial intelligence (AI) provided a second tailwind for the S&P 500. Investors have shrugged aside concerns about the macroeconomic environment and piled into AI stocks. For instance, Nvidia alone has contributed about 30% of the gains in the S&P 500 year to date, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have collectively driven about 26% of the gains.\n\nThe S&P 500's performance in the second half of 2024 will depend on how those variables continue to evolve, but one stock market indicator says the index will maintain its upward momentum. Specifically, following double-digit returns in the first half of the year, the S&P 500 has almost always climbed even higher during the second half. Here's what investors should know.\n\nHistory says the S&P 500 will soar in the second half of 2024\n\nGoing back to 1984, the S&P 500 has returned at least 10% during the first half of the year on 14 occasions. The index continued moving higher during the second half of the year on 12 of those 14 occasions, or 86% of the time. The chart below provides more detail.\n\nYear S&P 500 First-Half Return S&P 500 Second-Half Return 1985 15% 10% 1986 19% (3%) 1987 26% (19%) 1988 11% 2% 1989 15% 11% 1991 12% 12% 1995 19% 13% 1997 19% 10% 1998 17% 8% 1999 12% 7% 2013 13% 15% 2019 17% 10% 2021 14% 11% 2023 16% 7% Median N/A 10%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, when the S&P 500 has advanced at least 10% during the first half of a given year, the index has returned a median of 10% during the second half of the year.\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future results, but history implies double-digit upside in the S&P 500 through the remaining months of 2024. That is significant because the S&P 500 is considered the best benchmark for the overall U.S. stock market. Investors can capitalize on that potential upside by purchasing individual stocks, especially those that fall into the category of AI enablers, or an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nWhat investors should watch in the second half of 2024\n\nWall Street will continue to fixate on inflation and interest rates in the second half of the year, so investors should monitor both metrics. The Federal Reserve expects inflation to cool to 2.5% this year, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, but policymakers could cut interest rates faster than anticipated if inflation moderates more quickly. That would theoretically stimulate the economy and boost corporate earnings, potentially sending the S&P 500 higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlternatively, the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates at all this year if inflation remains elevated. In that scenario, high borrowing costs would continue to weigh on consumer and business spending, creating headwinds to economic growth that could tailspin into a recession. Even if the economy avoids a downturn, elevated interest rates could lead to worse-than-expected financial results across the stock market, potentially sending the S&P 500 lower.\n\nAdditionally, investors should be aware of the precarious situation regarding valuations. The S&P 500 currently trades at 26 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.3 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.4 times earnings. That means many stocks are expensive by historical standards, such that any pertinent bad news could have a particularly pronounced impact on the stock market.\n\nOf course, those are not the only variables that could sway the S&P 500 in the second half. They are merely the furthest downstream. Ultimately, anything that influences corporate earnings or investor sentiment -- be it the presidential election, geopolitical turmoil, breakthroughs in AI, or any number of impossible-to-predict events -- could sway the stock market for better or worse in the remaining months of the year.\n\nWith that in mind, here's the most valuable insight I can offer: The stock market has consistently performed well over long periods. Economic downturns dragged the S&P 500 through 14 market corrections and five bear markets in the last three decades, but the index still returned 2,060% during that period, which is the same as 10.7% annually. So, patient investors that buy and hold good stocks (or an S&P 500 index fund) at reasonable prices will likely be well rewarded over time, regardless of how the stock market performs in the second half of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Enterprise Products Partners Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "body": "Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is the kind of income stock that even the most conservative investors will fall in love with. The list of positives includes a conservative business model in a highly volatile sector, a large yield, and a strong financial foundation.\n\nIf that sounds good to you, here's a closer look at each point as it relates to this vitally important midstream energy company.\n\n1. Enterprise Products Partners is boring\n\nOil and natural gas prices can become pretty exciting at times, as both are frequently subject to massive and rapid swings. Given the impact of the commodities' prices on the financial performance of energy producers, the energy sector as a whole is generally viewed as volatile.\n\nBut there's one niche that operates in a very different manner: the midstream sector. This is where Enterprise Products Partners operates.\n\nMidstream players like Enterprise own pipelines, along with storage and transportation infrastructure. These are vital assets that connect the upstream sector (drilling) to the downstream (refining and chemicals) and to the rest of the world.\n\nMidstream companies generally charge fees for the use of their assets, making them toll-taker businesses. That means that energy demand is more important than energy prices to financial performance at Enterprise. And energy demand tends to be robust even when energy prices are low.\n\nEnterprise isn't exciting -- it just helps move oil and natural gas around -- and that's going to be a huge plus for investors who like consistency.\n\n2. Enterprise has a big, reliable yield\n\nAs a master limited partnership (MLP), Enterprise is specifically designed to pass income on to unitholders. So a high yield shouldn't be shocking, per se. But its 7.2% yield will still be very compelling for income-focused investors.\n\nCompare that figure to the yield from the S&P 500 index, which is a scant 1.3%. Or to the broader energy sector, which is yielding around 3.1% using Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund as an industry proxy. It is hard to beat Enterprise Products Partners if you are looking for passive income in the energy sector.\n\nEPD Chart\n\nAnd there's another very attractive fact here: The company has increased its distribution each year for 25 consecutive years. The annualized growth of the distribution has averaged 7%, which is pretty impressive.\n\nTo be clear, more-recent increases haven't lived up to that figure, so investors should go in only expecting mid-single-digit hikes. But the real story is the lofty yield, not lofty distribution growth. Yield will, in the end, make up the lion's share of an investor's return.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Enterprise has a rock-solid financial foundation\n\nOf course, the yield is only as good as the distribution is strong. And luckily, Enterprise scores very well on financial strength. The long streak of annual distribution increases speaks to that strength, but there are more direct ways to assess the financial foundation here.\n\nEPD Financial Debt to EBITDA (TTM) Chart\n\nFor starters, the balance sheet is rated investment grade. It maintained its leverage at the low end of its peers. Its debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, a key leverage metric in the midstream space, has been an industry best for some time.\n\nAnd, more to the point, the company's distributable cash flow covers its distribution 1.7 times over. There is a lot of room for adversity here before that distribution would be at risk of being cut.\n\nA great option for income investors\n\nThere are always trade-offs when it comes to investing. With Enterprise, the biggest one is going to be low growth.\n\nBut if your goal is generating a reliable passive income stream, then you will probably look at Enterprise and want to buy it like there's no tomorrow. Of course, you shouldn't own only Enterprise, and it should be viewed as one part of a larger, diversified portfolio.

        "title": "Buy, Sell, Hold: Amazon, Costco, and Walmart Stock Edition",
        "body": "U.S. retail is a multitrillion-dollar industry and a pillar of America's economy. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) are industry titans and world-class stocks that have all outperformed the broader stock market over the years.\n\nThese companies generate an astonishing $1.5 trillion in annual revenue. Their size gives them cost advantages that dominate smaller competitors, and they are poised to continue growing over the coming decades.\n\nHowever, their shares aren't all created equal. While all three are blue chip stocks, their varying price tags give investors much to consider. One of these stocks is a buy, one is a hold, and the other is a sell. Scroll down to see which one is which.\n\nBuy: An e-commerce giant firing on all cylinders\n\nAmazon has become the dominant e-commerce retailer in the United States. The company has amassed a whopping 37.6% market share, miles ahead of second-place Walmart. No company has the supply-chain capabilities to deliver such a breadth of products to consumers quickly, creating an unmatched consumer experience. Its subscription service, Amazon Prime, only reinforces the value proposition with streaming and other perks.\n\nHowever, Amazon's appeal spans beyond e-commerce; the company's cloud platform is also the world leader. Amazon Web Services is a pillar of the digital economy and a cash cow that generates massive profits. Management invests those profits throughout the business to create future growth opportunities. Arguably, no company is as aggressively expanding in new and existing markets as Amazon, which means the sky is the limit for its long-term investment potential.\n\nDespite its track record as a millionaire maker, Amazon's stock is still somehow cheap today. Amazon's hefty investments in growth mask the fact that the stock is at its lowest valuation in a decade if you compare its operating cash flow to its share price. Meanwhile, analysts believe earnings will grow by nearly 30% annually for the next several years. Don't hesitate to snatch up shares and hold them long-term.\n\nHold: America's largest retailer could shine in a recession\n\nWalmart is America's largest retailer; roughly 90% of the country's population lives within a short drive of a store. The company is famous for its low prices and also known for leveraging its massive size and bargaining power to do it. Walmart's store network and ability to reach shoppers have helped it grow. The company has expanded to other retail categories, including big-box, via Sam's Club and e-commerce.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, Walmart's stock isn't as outstanding a value as its products can be. Today, shares trade at a forward P/E of 28. That's a premium to the broader stock market, likely due to Walmart's sterling reputation on Wall Street. The company has paid and raised a dividend for 51 consecutive years, and a fortress-like balance sheet backs that. Plus, Walmart is likely to thrive in a recession when consumers leave competitors for Walmart to save money.\n\nAnalysts expect Walmart to continue growing for years, but estimates call for long-term earnings growth averaging just over 7%. It's hard to justify buying a stock at that valuation when you only get single-digit earnings growth. It might not be a bad idea to hold onto shares for Walmart's stellar fundamentals, but it's probably best to avoid buying for now.\n\nSell: This popular big-box retailer is woefully expensive\n\nWriting this next section is almost painful, but one can't ignore the facts. Look, Costco Wholesale is a genuinely excellent business. Its massive size helps it offer products at cheap prices, and its famous loss-leading products, such as its $1.50 hot dog meal, have created a cult-like following and loyalty among those who shop there. The membership fee that consumers pay to shop at Costco is genius and is its primary source of profits.\n\nHowever, despite its fantastic business, Costco stock has become so expensive that it's worth considering selling some shares. The stock trades at a whopping forward P/E of over 52, yet analysts believe earnings will grow by just 9.5% annually over the long term. That seems doable based on Costco's still-expanding store footprint and ability to raise membership dues.\n\nNearly 10% growth is nothing to sneeze at, except when paying over 50 times its earnings. There isn't any margin of safety in the stock price, which is a dangerous position to be in if a recession hits and shoppers start pulling back their wallets. Rather than roll the dice, consider selling and getting back in when the price makes more sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "The big problem facing whoever wins the election\n\n1 day ago By Faisal Islam , @faisalislam, Economics editor Share\n\nGetty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility\n\nAmid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon\u2019s Honda factory - once one of the world\u2019s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK\u2019s famous boom towns.\n\nA view of shuttered shops on a Swindon street\n\nThe Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday\u2019s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world\u2019s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.\n\nFaisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon\n\nMarcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still \u201cgood employment prospects\u201d but says many are at or \u201c50p above\u201d minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,\u201d he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. \u201cWe were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I\u2019ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,\u201d Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? \u201cIf I\u2019m unlucky, I\u2019m getting unlucky every single day and I\u2019m probably the unluckiest person on earth,\u201d she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.\n\nFormer Honda worker turned cafe-owner Marcus Kittridge\n\nGary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon\u2019s town centre looked like it was \u201crotting\u201d and asked if anything could change. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.\u201d\n\nGary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is \"rotting\"\n\nThe Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year\u2019s brief recession. Swindon\u2019s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of \u201cI\u2019m not defeatist\u201d or \u201cwe can do it\u201d. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style \"Big Bang\". She told me: \u201cIt\u2019s big reform we are offering\u2026 unless we grow the economy we\u2019re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.\u201d Labour\u2019s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.",

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n2 days ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

        "body": "Affordable home families hit by 450% gas price rise\n\n23 hours ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share\n\nBBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'\n\nResidents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are \"living in a horror story\" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as \u00a3400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.\n\nSome of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices\n\nJakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from \u00a360 to \u00a3350. He said: \"These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. \"The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. \"We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property.\" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. \"We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,\" he said. \"People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. \"It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. \"It is really desperate.\"\n\nHenda Sankareh said she got the \"fright of her life\" at the new gas prices\n\nThe price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the \"fright of her life\" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: \"They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. \"That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.\"\n\nScott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly\n\nAfter residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: \"The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. \"Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate.\" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: \"I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. \"We can't afford to move. He added: \"When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. \"We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. \"I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.\"\n\nAngela Stevenson said she would fight the price rise",
        "summary": "The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh.\nThe Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.\nThe low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water.\nAs long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water.\nMr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff.",

Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "body": "Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases\n\n3 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.\n\nHow do you treat E. coli and what are the symptoms?",

        "title": "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early",
        "body": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n3 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",
        "summary": "The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\nHowever, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.\nAbout 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September.\nA spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot.\nHowever, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot.",

        "body": "More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights\n\nAer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the \u201cindefinite nature\u201d of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots\u2019 industrial action it \u201cmust cancel\u201d additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I\u2019m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they\u2019ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. \u201cTrying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: \u2018Because you\u2019re a group we can\u2019t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don\u2019t open until 9am\u2019.\u201d Mr McWatters told the BBC\u2019s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been \u201cleft high and dry\u201d, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. \u201cAt that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,\u201d he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had \u201cfallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children\u201d. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don\u2019t meet you, we do every day. \"We\u2019ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we\u2019re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don\u2019t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union F\u00f3rsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RT\u00c9 has reported. If sanctioned, F\u00f3rsa will have to give seven days\u2019 notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is \"willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis\". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and F\u00f3rsa to \"agree to this step\".\n\nHow many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?\n\nAll Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about \u20ac36,000 (\u00a330,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about \u20ac287,000 (\u00a3242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nWhat do I do if my Aer Lingus flight is cancelled?",

        "body": "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\n\n3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \"a monster\" and that he was \"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

Typical household incomes went up by just \u00a3140 a year, new analysis from the Resolution Foundation showed. That is a total rise over the 14 year period of just 7% - or an average of half a percent a year - in the amount people had left over to spend after paying tax. By contrast, disposable incomes rose 38% over the 14 years up to 2010, the poverty-focused think tank wrote. However, poorer households had seen stronger income growth than richer ones, it said. The Resolution Foundation said the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and high inflation had all contributed to the slowdown, but that growth in general had also been \"sluggish\". That resulted in income rises \"slowing to a crawl\" it said, hampering progress in reducing poverty levels. The state of the economy, and especially the squeeze on ordinary families through the cost of living crisis, is a central theme in the general election, with the Conservatives defending their record in government since 2010.",

        "title": "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal",
        "body": "Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\n\n3 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\n\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\" she said. \"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\"\n\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \"releases\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \" he wrote. \"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\".\n\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\n\nGetty Images",

        "body": "IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\n\n4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\n\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \"clearly\" wanted him to say that \"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\".\n\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\n\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \"perfect\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \"fairly chaotic\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\". Mr Jenkins said this was \"totally inappropriate wording\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \"afflicted\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \"other reasons\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\n\nGuidance sought\n\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data \u201cprobably needs some further investigation\u201d. However, he said the decision to do so would be \u201chighly political\u201d. \"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \"what exactly we should be doing\". Mr Beer asked: \"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\" Mr Jenkins replied: \"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\" \"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\" Mr Jenkins responded: \"I don't know what to say to that.\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\n\n'I can't remember what I believed'",

        "body": "'How will we afford children with rent increases?'\n\n4 days ago By Alix Hattenstone, Miguel Roca-Terry and Jonathan Fagg , BBC England Data Unit Share\n\nDelia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage\n\nThe average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost \u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \u201cchronic shortage\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\n\n'All of us have been homeless'\n\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \u201cI was looking at my friends \u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\u2019t afford a house?\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \u00a31,312 to \u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\n\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\n\nHow has rent changed in your area?\n\nWhy has rent been increasing?\n\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \"geometric average\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\" he said. \"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\n\nWhere has rent increased the most?\n\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \u00a3555 in December 2019, to \u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\n\n'It was like a bidding war'\n\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \u2018mini budget\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth. This included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed \"Liz Truss' botched budget\" for \"driving up rents for tenants\" and a Labour spokesperson said \"time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters\". A Conservative Party spokesman said \u201cCovid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels\u201d, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. \u201cPeople were offering over the asking price or six months\u2019 rent up front. I wasn\u2019t in a position to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like a bidding war \u2013 I\u2019d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.\u201d Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for \u00a3900 per month. She said: \u201cI feel sorry for my children because my daughter\u2019s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 \u2013 he has to help me out with rent. He\u2019s unable to save up for his future.\u201d\n\nHow does your area compare to the rest of England?\n\nWhat do the different parties promise on rent?\n\nConservatives: Build 1.6 million homes over five years, introduce a new Help to Buy scheme requiring a 5% deposit and scrap stamp duty for properties up to \u00a3425,000 Labour: Help build 1.5 million homes over five years, introduce a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers, and end rental bidding wars. Extend protections around damp, mould and cold. Liberal Democrats: Build 380,000 homes a year and make three-year tenancies the default Reform UK: Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system for social housing, and encourage more people to become landlords by scrapping some taxes Green Party: Create 150,000 new social homes a year, implement rent controls and bring empty homes back into use",

Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \"unlicenced\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\n\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\n\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\n\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \"at risk\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\n\nJob forecasts",

        "title": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?",
        "body": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?\n\n4 days ago By Emma Woollacott , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores\n\nAmazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.\n\nAmazon was quick to claim that the reports were \u201cerroneous\u201d, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that \u201cthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common\u201d. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question \u2013 whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d in reference to the environmental \"green washing\".\n\nBut first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called \"generative AI\". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. \"Some founders seem to believe that if they don\u2019t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,\" says Mr Ayangar. \"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.\"\n\nSri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI\n\nIt is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as \"AI start-ups\" in fact used virtually no AI at all. \"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,\" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that \"cutting-edge AI capabilities\" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.\n\nDouglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. \"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. \"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.\" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: \"If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.\"\n\nRegulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. \"The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,\" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nNick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem",

        "body": "The screen tech that can do almost anything\n\n6 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nLink\u00f6ping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. \u201cThis is difficult but we think it\u2019s possible.\" In today\u2019s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone\u2019s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice demonstration\u2026 it\u2019s very new,\u201d says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled \u2013 at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. \u201cBy slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,\u201d says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. \u201cIf you think about mass production, this is gigantic.\u201d There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable \u2013 they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue \u2013 the key hues required for full colour digital displays.\n\nTo keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there\u2019s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn\u2019t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV\u2019s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It\u2019s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today\u2019s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.\n\nHelio Helio's film can re-emit blue light as either red or green with little light loss\n\nThe technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren\u2019t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.",

        "title": "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'",
        "body": "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'\n\n7 days ago By Sameer Hashmi , Middle East Business Correspondent BBC News Share\n\nShutterstock The Line, a planned 170km long linear city, may now initially extend for only 2.4km\n\n\u201cThey can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.\u201d That was the response of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia\u2019s flagship construction projects. Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true. In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030. This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state\u2019s de-facto ruler, to transition the country\u2019s economy away from oil-dependency. As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or \u201cgiga projects\u201d as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.\n\nBut low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies. An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon. \u201cThe decision will be based on multiple factors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.\u201d Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (\u00a3394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country. The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.\n\nGetty Images Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to diversify the country's economy\n\nThe original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants. But according to people familiar with the details \u2013 and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module. When The Line was first announced it was billed as a \u201ccarbon-free linear city\u201d that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids. The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits. How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear. Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029. Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately \u201cdesigned to be over ambitious\u201d. \u201cIt was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,\u201d says Mr Shihabi.\n\nThe scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing. Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country\u2019s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world\u2019s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year. The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.\n\nTim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future. \u201cIt is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,\u201d Mr Callen says. The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital. Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019. The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production. Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel. The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh\u2019s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors. \u2018It\u2019s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,\u201d says Mr Callen. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.\u201d The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.",

That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.

Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.\n\nBoeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.\n\nIn 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.\n\nCEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.\n\nHe said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operators dedicated to Airbus planes.\n\nSpirit's CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.",

        "body": "Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.\n\nBut the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.\n\n\"A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,\" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\n\n\"As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,\" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.\n\nThis trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.\n\nJones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.\n\nHe explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.\n\n\"Human beings do the same thing,\" Jones explained. \"Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.\"\n\nJones' recently published book \"Face Your Fears\" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.",

        "body": "In this article EXPE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nNearly two in three workers around the world are \"vacation deprived,\" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's \"Vacation Deprivation Report\" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days \u2014 27 days and 29 days, respectively \u2014 in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel \"vacation deprived\" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.\n\nThe survey \u2014 Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic \u2014 shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.\n\nWhat's happening in France and Germany?\n\nExpedia's report indicates that feeling \"vacation deprived\" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. \"The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,\" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. \"This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAmong Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. \"This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,\" she said, adding that \"vacation deprivation\" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.\n\nWasted vacation days\n\nDespite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.\n\nHong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. \"In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,\" said Hudson. \"It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally.\" That could mean that \"those few extra days here and there are overlooked,\" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.\n\nOne big break vs. many mini-breaks",

        "body": "A screen displays stock figures at the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. headquarters in Taipei, Taiwan, on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nOptimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn \u2014 traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry \u2014 jumped 105% in the same period. \"The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,\" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.\n\nJapan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.\n\nwatch now\n\nGhosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible \u2014 and considerable \u2014 impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy \"in a gradual and measured way.\" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. \"We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates.\" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets \u2014 Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.\n\nAll eyes on the Fed\n\nMost central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent \"dot plot\" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nwatch now\n\nRate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a \"reasonable prediction\" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. \"We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.\"\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "An aerial view shows a Philippines Navy vessel that has been grounded since 1999 to assert the nation's sovereignty over the Second Thomas Shoal, a remote South China Sea reef also claimed by China. Jay Directo | Afp | Getty Images\n\nChina has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. \"The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,\" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the Philippines and U.S. released new \"Bilateral Defense Guidelines,\" reaffirming that an \"armed attack\" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing \"gray zone\" tactics \u2014 coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict \u2014 at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.\n\nU.S. 'gray zone' conundrum\n\nBeijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ \"gray zone\" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. \"The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,\" he said.\n\nGP: Philippine Coast Guard personnel ride a rubber boat past a Chinese Coast Guard vessel during a resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nAn expanded definition of an \"armed attack\" in the treaty could include \"any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,\" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,\" said Heydarian. \"It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,\" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.\n\nAmid a \"sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,\" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an \"armed attack,\" the country needs to \"do more\" than protest China's actions.\n\nA Chinese Coast Guard ship fires a water cannon at Unaizah May 4, a Philippine Navy chartered vessel, conducting a routine resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea.

There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,\" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. \"Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,\" he added.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Boeing Co. agreed Sunday to purchase Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 per share in an all-stock deal that values the company at $4.7 billion, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.\n\nThe US planemaker also plans to assume about $3.5 billion of Spirit\u2019s debt as part of the deal, which may be announced as soon as Monday, said the people, who asked not to be identified before the transaction is made public. Reuters reported the per-share price earlier Sunday. Representatives for the companies declined to comment.\n\nBoeing plans to take control of the Spirit\u2019s manufacturing that supports its commercial jet line-up, including building frames for its cash-cow 737 Max, two of the people said. It will also gain control over a portion of Spirit\u2019s defense contract work, they said.\n\nBoeing arch-rival Airbus SE is also expected to announce that it\u2019s taking control over some of the Spirit factories that manufacture structures and components for its commercial aircraft. Terms for that transaction weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nBoeing is seeking to reintegrate Spirit after an accident in January on board a 737 Max-9 airliner revealed quality and manufacturing shortcomings at both Boeing and its most important supplier and led to a rethinking of their relationship.\n\nSpirit has faced growing financial pressure and scrutiny alongside Boeing after the door-shaped panel on a 737 Max 9 model blew out minutes after takeoff. Shipments of 737 fuselages have plummeted as Boeing steps up its inspections in Kansas and back at home near Seattle, and declined to accept aircraft structures with missing components or incomplete work.\n\nFor Boeing, the deal brings a key supplier for the 737, 787 Dreamliner and other commercial jets back in-house at a time when the company is feeling the financial strain from the slowed-down output. Boeing lost about $4 billion in cash in the first quarter and is set to lose a similar amount in the current three months of the year. The company\u2019s credit rating is hovering one level above speculative grade, and management is keen to avoid slipping into junk territory.\n\nThe Wichita campus that builds most of the 737 airframe for Boeing along with the nose sections of the 787 Dreamliners had been at the heart of several defects as it grappled with post-Covid workforce turnover. Reintegrating Spirit aims to help Boeing stabilize its supply chain and gain greater control of its aircraft production.",

        "body": "\u201c A Quiet Place: Day One \u201d is making noise at the box office. The prequel earned an estimated $53 million in its first weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s both a franchise best and significantly more than expected. Going into the weekend, prerelease tracking had \u201cDay One\u201d pegged for a $40 million debut, but audiences were clearly more enthusiastic to see the action-horror starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Joseph Quinn and released by Paramount. The same could not be said for Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201c Horizon: An American Saga\u2014Chapter 1,\u201d which opened to $11 million.\n\nThe \u201dQuiet Place\u201d victory wasn\u2019t quite enough to snag the coveted first place spot on the charts, though. That honor again went to Disney and Pixar\u2019s juggernaut \u201c Inside Out 2,\u201d which added an estimated $57.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, and crossed $1 billion globally.\n\nThere\u2019s a distant possibility that the places will shift when actuals are released Monday. But either way it\u2019s good news for movie theaters in a summer season that\u2019s finally heating up but still running far behind last year (down 19%) and pre-pandemic norms (down 36% from 2019).\n\n\u201cInside Out 2\u201d continues to be a box office phenomenon, the likes of which the industry hasn\u2019t seen since \u201cBarbie\u201d almost a year ago. In just three weeks of release, it\u2019s earned nearly $470 million in North America and $545.5 million internationally, bringing its global total to $1.01 billion. The sequel is the only 2024 release to cross the billion dollar mark and it did it in just 19 days, a record for an animated film.\n\n\u201cThe film\u2019s stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, in a statement.\n\n\u201cA Quiet Place: Day One,\u201d directed by Michael Sarnoski and rated PG-13, is also fast approaching an important threshold out of the gates. Including the $45.5 million from international showings in 59 markets, the $67 million production has already made $98.5 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love for the \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 franchise,\u201d said Chris Aronson, the head of domestic distribution for Paramount. \u201cWe listened to the fans who wanted to expand the universe.\u201d\n\nIn a rare feat for a third film, it opened higher than both \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d ($50.2 million opening in April 2018) and \u201c A Quiet Place: Part II \u201d ($47.5 million opening in May 2021). John Krasinski, who wrote and directed the first two, continued serving as a producer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those rare horror franchises that has generated incredible goodwill with audiences and critics alike,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nPlaying on 3,708 screens in the U.S. and Canada, nearly 40% of its domestic earnings came from \u201cpremium screens\u201d including IMAX and other large formats. It entered the marketplace with mostly positive reviews (84% on Rotten Tomatoes); Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore and four out of five stars on PostTrak.\n\n\u201cWe put together a compelling package but also I think it shows people want to go to the movies,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThe marketplace really works when there are choices and there\u2019s something for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe start for \u201cHorizon,\u201d meanwhile, was sluggish. Though older audiences, the ones most likely to support a Western epic, don\u2019t typically rush out to see films on opening weekend the way people often do for horrors and superheroes, the road ahead will not be easy: Reviews have not been great and it got an underwhelming B- CinemaScore.\n\nThe stakes are also a little different for \u201cHorizon,\u201d a $100 million production that Costner financed on his own and partnered with Warner Bros. to distribute. It opened in 3,334 locations. A decades-old passion project, he mortgaged property in Santa Barbara, Calif. to finance it and exited \u201cYellowstone\u201d to see it through. In a bold, unconventional strategy, \u201cChapter 2\u201d arrives in theaters later this summer, on Aug. 16. He also has plans for two more movies.\n\n\u201cThe western genre is one of those that is very specific,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about the long game.\u201d\n\nA quick glance at the top 10 shows that audiences are largely favoring franchises and \u201cknown commodities\u201d over originals. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d was right behind \u201cHorizon\u201d on the charts, and it\u2019s been in theaters for four weeks already.\n\n\u201cAudiences in the summer want the tried and true, they want the familiar,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nHe was also struck by the diversity of genres in the top 10, including two Indian films: The Telugu language sci-fi \u201cKalki 2898 AD\u201d in fifth place with $5.4 million and the Punjabi language \u201cJatt & Juliet 3\u201d in ninth place with $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t find something that appeals to you at the multiplex right now, you\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d $57.4 million.\n\n2. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One,\u201d $53 million.\n\n3. \u201cHorizon: An American Saga\u2014Chapter 1,\u201d $11 million.\n\n4. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d $10.3 million.\n\n5. \u201cKalki 2898 AD,\u201d $5.4 million.\n\n6. \u201cThe Bikeriders,\u201d $3.3 million.\n\n7. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d $2 million.\n\n8. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d $168.1 million.\n\n9. \u201cJatt & Juliet 3,\u201d $1.5 million.\n\n10. \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d $1.5 million.",

        "body": "The U.S. Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.\n\nBoeing will have until the end of the coming week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, they said.\n\nThe case stems from the department\u2019s determination that Boeing violated an agreement that was intended to resolve a 2021 charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. Prosecutors alleged at the time that Boeing misled regulators who approved the 737 Max and set pilot-training requirements to fly the plane. The company blamed two relatively low-level employees for the fraud.\n\nThe Justice Department told relatives of some of the 346 people who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes about the plea offer during a video meeting. The family members, who want Boeing to face a criminal trial and to pay a $24.8 billion fine, reacted angrily. One said prosecutors were gaslighting the families; another shouted at them for several minutes when given a chance to speak.\n\n\u201cWe are upset. They should just prosecute,\u201d said Massachusetts resident Nadia Milleron, whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the second of two 737 Max crashes. \u201cThis is just a reworking of letting Boeing off the hook.\u201d\n\nProsecutors told the families that if Boeing rejects the plea offer, the Justice Department would seek a trial in the matter, meeting participants said. Justice Department officials presented the offer to Boeing during a meeting later Sunday, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nBoeing and the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe plea deal would take away the ability of U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor to increase Boeing\u2019s sentence for a conviction, and some of the families plan to ask the Texas judge to reject the deal if Boeing agrees to it.\n\n\u201cThe underlying outrageous piece of this deal is that it doesn\u2019t acknowledge that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people,\u201d said Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers for victims\u2019 families. \u201cBoeing is not going to be held accountable for that, and they are not going to admit that that happened.\u201d\n\nSanjiv Singh, a lawyer for 16 families who lost relatives in the October 2018 Lion Air crash off Indonesia, called the plea offer \u201cextremely disappointing.\u201d The terms, he said, \u201cread to me like a sweetheart deal.\u201d\n\nAnother lawyer representing families who are suing Boeing, Mark Lindquist, said he asked the head of the Justice Department\u2019s fraud section, Glenn Leon, whether the department would add additional charges if Boeing turns down the plea deal. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t commit one way or another,\u201d Lindquist said.\n\nThe meeting with crash victims\u2019 families came weeks after prosecutors told O\u2019Connor that the American aerospace giant breached the January 2021 deal that had protected Boeing from criminal prosecution in connection with the crashes. The second one took place in Ethiopia less than five months after the one in Indonesia.\n\nA conviction could jeopardize Boeing\u2019s status as a federal contractor, according to some legal experts. The company has large contracts with the Pentagon and NASA.\n\nHowever, federal agencies can give waivers to companies that are convicted of felonies to keep them eligible for government contracts. Lawyers for the crash victims\u2019 families expect that would be done for Boeing.\n\nBoeing paid a $244 million fine as part of the 2021 settlement of the original fraud charge. The Justice Department is likely to seek another, similar penalty as part of the new plea offer, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing to discuss an ongoing case.\n\nThe deal would include a monitor to oversee Boeing \u2014 but the company would put forward three nominees and have the Justice Department pick one, or ask Boeing for additional names. That provision was particularly hated by the family members on the call, participants said.\n\nThe Justice Department also gave no indication of moving to prosecute any current or former Boeing executives, another long-sought demand of the families.\n\nLindquist, a former prosecutor, said officials made clear during an earlier meeting that individuals \u2013 even CEOs \u2013 can be more sympathetic defendants than corporations. The officials pointed to the 2022 acquittal on fraud charges of Boeing\u2019s chief technical pilot for the Max as an example.\n\nIt is unclear what impact a plea deal might have on other investigations into Boeing, including those following the blowout of a panel called a door plug from the side of a Boeing Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.",

        "body": "The presidential election has brought the issue of federal budget deficits back into the spotlight as markets weigh the impact of another Biden or Trump administration on government revenue and spending.\n\nA week before this past Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, the Congressional Budget Office updated its projections for U.S. debt and deficits.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s new estimate for the fiscal 2024 deficit is now $1.9 trillion, up from its prior view for $1.6 trillion issued in February and up from the 2023 deficit of about $1.7 trillion.\n\nWhile the 2024 figure falls short of the pandemic-era high of $3 trillion, a level of $1.9 trillion nearly matches Russia\u2019s entire GDP, which the World Bank put at $2 trillion in 2023, making it the 11th biggest economy in the world.\n\nPart of the reason for the increase in the projected 2024 deficit was to account for emergency spending that went to help Ukraine fight Russia, the CBO said. Other emergency appropriations went to Israel and U.S. allies in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. deficit eclipses other major economies like Mexico\u2019s ($1.79 trillion), Australia\u2019s ($1.72 trillion), and South Korea\u2019s ($1.71 trillion).\n\nFor now, financial markets have largely focused more on inflation data and when the Federal Reserve will cut rates. But that doesn\u2019t mean the risks of a widening deficit and debt are absent.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that unsustainable trends always come to an end.\n\nHe also warned that the situation could go south quickly. For example, if bond markets start to balk at buying Treasuries, interest rates will go up to attract more demand. That leads to the government paying more for debt service costs, which then adds further to the deficit.\n\n\u201cSo the feedback loop here can be quite vicious,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cThe hard thing is to know the timing.\u201d\n\nHe added that there\u2019s less demand for U.S. Treasury bonds in certain corners of the global market because Western sanctions on Russia prompted other countries to diversify away from dollar-denominated assets.\n\nIn addition, debt that was issued at lower rates is now being rolled over to higher rates, so debt service costs are going up more rapidly than total debt, Dudley said.\n\nThe election and its aftermath could be catalysts. Amid a Wall Street Journal report that said Trump\u2019s allies have drawn up plans to erode the Fed\u2019s independence, an election victory could raise concerns the Fed will monetize U.S. debt by buying more Treasuries and stoking inflation.\n\nTo be sure, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to gain control over the Fed as the regional bank presidents aren\u2019t appointed by the White House and Fed governors have staggered terms, Dudley pointed out.\n\n\u201cThat said, just the mere attempt to take control of the Fed, to diminish the Fed\u2019s independence could be the spark that rattles markets,\u201d he added.",

        "title": "Japan, Korea twist Silicon Valley model through conglomerate-startup connections",
        "body": "We all know how things work in Silicon Valley. Brilliant individuals with great ideas disrupt whole industries: Uber and public transport, Tesla and car-making, even Microsoft and the workplace itself. Older incumbents won\u2019t, and can\u2019t, adapt with the times\u2014and so they disappear, replaced by the firms of today and tomorrow. It\u2019s the way tech hubs are supposed to work.\n\nExcept that not all do.\n\nThe Silicon Valley model is tied closely to the economic model of the U.S.\u2014and so difficult to replicate elsewhere. Silicon Valley excels in some aspects of frontier technology but lost its manufacturing edge long ago.\n\nAround the world, policymakers are tweaking the idea of Silicon Valley to better match the idiosyncrasies of their own economies and carve out a unique advantage in key global markets.\n\nLook to Japan and Korea for examples. Large conglomerates dominate the economies of both countries, whether Japan\u2019s keiretsu or South Korea\u2019s chaebol. Officials in Tokyo and Seoul don\u2019t see the point of startups disrupting hugely successful and internationalized companies to the point that they disappear.\n\nInstead, they want startups to work with giants like Hyundai, Samsung, SK, Sony or Toyota. It\u2019s an instance of David meeting Goliath: an open innovation model where small firms and big conglomerates work together, aided by the government. This approach helps policymakers innovate in the design and manufacturing of tomorrow\u2019s technologies.\n\nCritics often accuse chaebols and keiretsu of stifling competition. But Japanese and Korean policymakers don\u2019t want to work against the conglomerates that have helped their countries become two of the richest and most innovate economies in the world.\n\nFor a forthcoming book, titled Startup Capitalism, we studied how both Japan and Korea tried to foster this collaboration between startups and conglomerates. Government support for this \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d relationship survived Japan and Korea\u2019s frequent changes in political leadership; it\u2019s now part of the fabric of both economies.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nTo begin with, startups get access to expertise, mentoring, and sales channels that they\u2019d find difficult to develop on their own. Managers in a conglomerate like LG and Nissan have decades of experience in their core business sectors. Startup founders, generally, do not\u2014instead relying on connections from VC backers or their own personal networks\n\nPrograms such as K-Startup Grand Challenge, anchored by Seoul\u2019s Ministry of SMEs & Startups, or J-Startup, led by Tokyo\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, help to bridge this asymmetry in resources and access. Large firms join these government programs as judges, coaches, and would-be partners for startups. The Japanese and Korean governments thus act as matchmakers between entrepreneurs and leading conglomerates. (The U.S. policy approach, instead, is to only support startups.)\n\nBy taking part in these programs, Japanese and Korean startups also get access to capital and, often, exit strategies. Seoul and Tokyo pour billions of taxpayer dollars into supporting entrepreneurs via institutions like the Korea Venture Investment Corporation or the Japan Finance Corporation. Connecting these startups with chaebol or keiretsu that otherwise may not know about their ideas or products makes it easier for the big firms to decide whether to invest in their smaller counterparts.\n\nSo, startups clearly benefit from working with conglomerates. But what do larger companies get out of this?\n\nThe second advantage of this open innovation model is that the keiretsu and chaebol get access to new ideas and products. Several Japanese and Korean policymakers told us that they were worried that their national champions might go the way of Motorola or Nokia, former innovation powerhouses that got left behind. Working together with startups is one way that big conglomerates can develop new products and improve existing ones.\n\nUltimately, Japan and Korea want startups and conglomerates to work together to improve the economy. They see startups as drivers of innovation and growth in quality jobs; conglomerates help these smaller firms achieve that.\n\nConglomerates also provide manufacturing chops needed to make future technologies at scale. Silicon Valley long ago outsourced the production of key technologies, like semiconductors, elsewhere. Bringing those manufacturing abilities\u2014that offer quality jobs and contribute to clusters of talent\u2014back onshore is a key aim of the U.S.\u2019s multi-billion-dollar CHIPS Act.\n\nIn fact, it seems this model of startups working together with large companies is now getting picked up in other parts of the world. In the AI sector, Microsoft is working with smaller partners like ChatGPT developer OpenAI and France\u2019s Mistral. Both Amazon and Google have invested in developers like Anthropic; China\u2019s big tech companies are also buying large stakes in the country\u2019s AI startups. The Biden administration and the Von der Leyen Commission are both pushing startup-big firm collaboration as part of their respective industrial policies.\n\nWe should expect the Japanese and Korean model of startup-big firm collaboration to become more widespread. Governments are turning towards industrial policy and economic nationalism, and away from laissez-faire liberalism\u2014in other words, closer to the policies long espoused by Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nSilicon Valley isn\u2019t dead. But its version of startup capitalism isn\u2019t the only game in town anymore.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

        "title": "Far-right party takes strong lead in France\u2019s legislative election, while Macron\u2019s centrist group trails badly in first-round voting",
        "body": "France\u2019s high-stakes legislative elections propelled the far-right National Rally to a strong but not decisive lead in the first-round vote Sunday, polling agencies projected, dealing another slap to centrist President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe projections indicated that Macron\u2019s risky decision to call voters back to the polls for the second time in three weeks appeared to have backfired.\n\nFrench polling agencies said Macron\u2019s grouping of centrist parties could finish a distant third in the first-round ballot. Those projections put Macron\u2019s camp behind both Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and a new left-wing coalition of parties that joined forces to keep her anti-immigration party with historical links to antisemitism from being able to form the first far-right government in France since World War II.\n\nBut with another torrid week of campaigning to come before the decisive final voting next Sunday, the election\u2019s ultimate outcome remained uncertain.\n\nMacron urged voters to rally against the far right in the second round.\n\nAddressing a jubilant crowd waving French tricolor flags of blue, white and red, Le Pen called on her supporters and voters that didn\u2019t back her party in the first round to push it over the line and give it a commanding legislative majority. In that scenario, Le Pen\u2019s 28-year-old protege, Jordan Bardella, would become prime minister. Macron, who has said he will not step down before his term expires in 2027, would be forced into an awkward power-sharing arrangement called \u201c cohabitation\u201d in France.\n\nStill, the National Rally isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nAlthough polling agency projections gave it around one-third of the national vote on Sunday, it remains unclear how the party\u2019s surge will translate into actual seats in round two.\n\nSome polling agency projections indicated that in the best-case scenario for the far right, the National Rally and its allies could collectively clear the bar of 289 seats needed for a secure majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. That could spook European financial markets, affect Western support for Ukraine and the management of France\u2019s nuclear arsenal and global military force.\n\nBut, depending on how the second round shakes out, the far right could also fall short, with no single bloc securing a clear majority, polling agencies projected. Predictions are difficult because of the two-round voting system,and because parties will work between the rounds to make alliances in some constituencies or pull out of others. Early official results for the first round were expected later Sunday.\n\nMany French voters are frustrated about inflation and other economic concerns, as well as Macron\u2019s leadership, seen as arrogant and out-of-touch with their lives. The National Rally party has tapped that discontent, notably via online platforms such as TikTok.\n\nVoters in Paris had issues including immigration and the rising cost of living on their minds as the country grew more divided between the far-right and far-left blocs, with a deeply unpopular and weakened president in the political center. The campaign was marred by rising hate speech.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like what has been happening,\u201d said Cynthia Justine, 44. \u201cPeople feel they\u2019ve lost a lot in recent years. People are angry. I am angry.\u201d She added that with \u201cthe rising hate speech,\u201d it was necessary to express frustrations with those holding and seeking power.\n\nShe said it was important as a woman to vote since women haven\u2019t always had that right. And \u201cbecause I am a Black woman, it\u2019s even more important. A lot is at stake on this day.\u201d\n\nMacron called the early elections after his party was trounced in the European Parliament election earlier in June by the National Rally, which has historic ties to racism and antisemitism and is hostile toward France\u2019s Muslim community. It also has historical ties to Russia.\n\nMacron\u2019s call was an audacious gamble that French voters who were complacent about the European election would be jolted into turning out for moderate forces in national elections to keep the far right out of power.\n\nA 64-year-old voter, Philippe Lempereur, expressed fatigue with politicians from the left, right and center and what he called their inability to work together on issues such as ensuring people have shelter and enough to eat. \u201cWe vote by default, for the least worse option,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to vote than do nothing.\u201d\n\nBardella, who has no governing experience, says he would use the powers of prime minister to stop Macron from continuing to supply long-range weapons to Ukraine for the war with Russia.\n\nThe National Rally has also questioned the right to citizenship for people born in France, and it wants to curtail the rights of French citizens with dual nationality. Critics say this undermines human rights and is a threat to France\u2019s democratic ideals.\n\nMeanwhile, huge public spending promises by the National Rally and especially the left-wing coalition have shaken markets and ignited worries about France\u2019s heavy debt, already criticized by EU watchdogs.\n\nIn the restive French Pacific territory of New Caledonia, polls closed earlier due to a curfew that authorities have extended until July 8. Violence flared there last month, leaving nine people dead, due to attempts by Macron\u2019s government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists, which the Indigenous Kanaks feared would further marginalize them. They have long sought to break free from France.\n\nVoters in France\u2019s other overseas territories of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint-Martin, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyana and French Polynesia, and those voting in offices opened by embassies and consular posts across the Americas cast their ballots Saturday.",

It is a sign of improvement for the port,\u201d says Emmanuel Mallya, an expert in port issues in Tanzania.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing positive prospects for the growth of the port. We used to bring to our ICD six containers for 12 hours. Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.\u201d\n\nDar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.\n\nThe two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.\n\nPort users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.\n\nAccording to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.\n\n\u201cAll our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don\u2019t know where to send additional ones,\u201d he says.\n\nDar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.\n\nTanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai\u2019s DP World and India\u2019s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.\n\nThe country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.\n\nMombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region\u2019s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.\n\nDP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.\n\nDP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.\n\nThe agreement aims to optimise the port\u2019s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.\n\nAdani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port\u2019s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.\n\nWith this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.\n\nKenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.\n\nLast year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.\n\nDar Port, handles 90 percent of Tanzania\u2019s trade, clearing $15 billion of merchandise annually.\n\nDP World has begun to enhance the port's efficiency with new equipment and systems, promising significant economic benefits for Tanzania and its neighbouring countries.\n\nRecently, the port witnessed the operation of ship-to-shore cranes for the first time, powered by mega generators moved into the terminal by DP World.\n\nThis new infrastructure enabled the completion of the first sulfur vessel in a record four days, marking a historic milestone for the port.\n\nAdditionally, the modernisation efforts have allowed the longest vessel ever to dock at the port.",

        "body": "Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.\n\nThe interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday\u2019s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.\n\nThis bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.\n\nEurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.\n\nThis is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.\n\nEurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.\n\nFor the five-year bond\u2014which the government repaid in June 2019\u2014the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.\n\nThe 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.\n\n\u201cPayment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,\u201d Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.\n\nAt the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.\n\nThe government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.\n\nIn the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.\n\nIn the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.\n\nIn agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.\n\nA special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.\n\nThis made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.\n\nSubsequent Eurobond sales have tended to go towards general funding of the budget, or repaying other maturing debt.\n\nIn February 2018, part of the proceeds of the second Eurobond sale, which raised Sh202 billion, was used to retire syndicated loans contracted in 2015 and 2017.",

        "body": "President William Ruto faces public scrutiny and delicate juggling over his pledge to cut non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb the wastage of funds.\n\nOfficial estimates showed that the items listed as non-essential for the President\u2019s office total Sh667 million\u2014 putting the focus on the size of chops that would be effected to justify his austerity promise while avoiding inconvenience to his day-to-day activities.\n\nCuts to travel expenditure may see Dr Ruto reduce local and foreign trips, while the planned refurbishment of his office in Nairobi\u2019s Central Business District and the modernisation of the government printing press could also be halted in the rationalisation plan.\n\nThe pronouncement by the President proposing cuts to his office budget was forced upon by days of deadly protests in which the public demanded an end to wasteful and frivolous spending by the State amidst lean times caused by high debt levels.\n\nThe proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.\n\n\u201cI direct immediate further austerity measures extending to the entire Executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,\u201d President Ruto said.\n\nThe listed spending areas had an allocation of Sh667 million for the financial year starting today, according to data from the National Treasury budget books.\n\nSpending on domestic and foreign travel had been estimated at Sh10.4 million and Sh7.5 million respectively, a higher allocation compared to the Sh5.2 million and Sh7.2 million programmed in the budget ended June 30. The hospitality supplies and services budget was however lower at Sh84.7 million in contrast to Sh144.1 million previously.\n\nThe purchase of vehicles and other transport equipment for the Executive Office of the President would have however gobbled up Sh50 million from Sh27.3 million previously.\n\nOther recurrent spending areas for the office cover printing, advertising, and information supplies and services; training expenses, purchase of fuel and lubricants, purchase of office furniture and the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.\n\nProposed cuts to development spending by the office cover the refurbishment of buildings at Harambee House which hosts the Executive Office of the President and the modernisation of the press and refurbishment of buildings at the government printer which sits on Haile Selassie Avenue in the capital city.\n\nThe budget to refurbish the President's office in Nairobi CBD was set at Sh14.3 million while the upgrade of the government printer would cost Sh500 million.\n\nThe total budget to the Executive Office of the President had been set at Sh5.3 billion for the year to June 2025.\n\nPresident William Ruto can implement the desired changes to the Sh3.92 trillion budget through the 1st supplementary estimates for the 2024/25 financial year having signed the 2024 Appropriations Bill into law on Friday as passed by MPs.\n\nThe President indicated that the supplementary budget would achieve cuts of Sh346 billion covering the hole resulting from the withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill.\n\nThe initial Sh3.92 trillion budget included Sh2.78 trillion in recurrent spending, Sh687.9 billion in development spending, Sh446.1 billion in transfers to counties including equitable share, Sh43.6 billion to Parliament, and Sh23.6 billion to the Judiciary.\n\nThe National Treasury expected to fund the budget through Sh3.3 trillion in total revenue collections including Sh2.91 trillion in taxes, leaving behind a balance of Sh597 billion to be plugged by Sh33.8 billion in external financing and Sh263.2 billion in domestic borrowing.",

        "title": "Leaders gaslighting us to submission",
        "body": "The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines gaslighting as the psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories and typically leads to confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem, uncertainty of one's emotional or mental stability and a dependency on the perpetrator.\n\nThe dictionary continues to explain that the term gaslighting originated from the title of a 1938 play and the movies based on that play, the plots of which involve a man attempting to make his wife believe that she is going insane. His mysterious activities in the attic cause the house\u2019s gas lights to dim, but he insists to his wife that the lights are not dimming and that she can\u2019t trust her own perceptions.\n\nI ended my column last Monday by saying that following the Gen Z protests the previous week, corporate leaders need Gen Z mentors to help them get a real-time understanding of their current and future customers. Then things became hotter last Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nGas flame hot. Conversations on various social media platforms became emotive, passionate and even incendiary. Two debates on two different groups that I am a member of stood out for me. The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this. One MP hugged a mute tree and remained as silent as a Manchester United fan at a Premier League Recent Winner\u2019s Whatsapp group as the group chatter went on and on about how tone-deaf the political class were choosing to be against their constituents.\n\nThe second MP chose to leap off the self-incriminating cliff with defensive clapbacks on why they voted yes, once a video of them speaking in Parliament supporting the controversial Finance Bill was posted on the group. This MP thumped their chest and said they had nothing to apologise for. The abuses that followed sent the second MP to join the first one sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.\n\nThe second debate was on a different group of professional colleagues. Amongst them is a senior public servant who chose to come in and throw a grenade. Rather than reading the room where there was also much discussion about the reason behind the tax protests, the individual chose to paint a picture of chaos, fear and despondency if the protests, which by this time had started having violent outcomes, didn\u2019t end.\n\nThe individual did not for a single minute explain the rationale behind the Finance Bill. Not a single minute. Consequently, many of the other group members called the individual out, asking them to remove the rose-tinted glasses and red carpet-lined blinkers that were blocking them from seeing what the mood of the nation was. Following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill later that day, nothing has been heard from the individual who likely joined the other MPs sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.\n\nLegislators post dancing videos on Tiktok, swaying their hips with shiny faces lifted to the Range Rover heavens, thanking their Lexus gods for the far they have come.\n\nWhen called out for the exuberance of their instant coffee wealth, they rubbish the naysayers and call them jealous. They gaslight the public and tell them how a stable country is critical for prosperity and that the new taxes will be good for the country. They look for an evil bogeyman who is pulling the strings of resistance, since Kenyans are unable, neither individually nor collectively, to see wanton wastage and blatant corruption.\n\nWe get it, dear public servants. We get it completely. You know better than us what is good for us. You know what good governance looks like from the third floor of your newly purchased Karen villas. You rush to give us good governance as your chase cars run us off the road, with the ubiquitous dour-faced bodyguard pointing an ashen walkie-talkie holding wrist at us for daring to share the same tarmac that you do.",

        "body": "As she charts the next path after leaving the board of directors of Equity Group Holdings, Mary Wangari Wamae will be opening a fresh chapter in her rich personal story.\n\nShe was the group executive director for Equity Holdings, a role that saw her oversee all of the bank's subsidiaries. Besides the long-serving CEO James Mwangi and the founder and former chairman Peter Munga, Ms Wamae is perhaps the only other prominent personality who has shaped the history of Equity Bank.\n\nAs one promotion followed the other, rumours swirled that she was being groomed to replace Mwangi. Her exit puts to rest those rumours.\n\nMs Wamae is certainly one of the authors of Equity's recent success story, which started with a remarkable turnaround that saw Equity miraculously escape dissolution by the regulator after years of operating under insolvency. When Wamae joined Equity in 2004, after a 13-year legal practice, she played a key role in writing the next chapter of Equity, chief among which was converting the financial institution from a troubled building society into a formidable pan-African bank with a presence in seven countries.\n\nMs Wamae, a lawyer by training, was also part of the team that helped Equity Bank list on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), giving the lender the impetus to make the great leap into Pan-African banking.\n\nA conglomerate with business interests spanning different sectors, Equity Group would become the first company in the region to cross the Sh1 trillion in assets in 2020.\n\nThere is just something about Wamae and Mwangi that makes them the perfect bearers of Equity Bank's DNA: They both had humble beginnings and were raised by single mothers in rural Central Kenya.\n\nIt is these modest beginnings which informed Equity's reincarnation as a bank for the common mwananchi, with the tier-one lender revolutionizing micro-lending in Kenya.\n\nIn the 1990s, banks were snobbish. They didn\u2019t think the poor people like Mwangi's and Wamae's mothers were bankable.\n\nThe income for most of these poor rural folks was not only erratic, but it was also unreliably erratic. Banks slammed their doors on Wanjiku, and she clammed up with her money.\n\nThus, Wamae, who was also brought up in hardship in Kenya, was a perfect catch for Equity's spirit when she joined the company in 2004 as the secretary. Just like Mwangi, she embodied the fighting spirit of Equity Bank.\n\nIn a past interview, Wamae credited her mother for bequeathing her with the fighting spirit, and not to complain despite difficult circumstances one may find themselves in.\n\nRaised in Nyeri County by a single mother in a family of six children, Ms Wangari did not have an easy childhood. Her mother did not have a fixed income but she made all efforts to educate her.\n\nShe powered through her education journey with finesse, picking a reading habit in the process. Later in life, she became an avid reader.\n\nWhen she graduated with a law degree from the University of Nairobi (UoN) in 1990, Ms Wangari was beginning the journey towards breaking from the obscurity that her background risked driving her to.\n\nJoining UoN offered her the chance to visit the capital for the first time in her life. She was in the famous UoN class that had the likes of Trade Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano, MPs Millie Odhiambo and Caroli Omondi, lawyers like Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Azimio leader Raila Odinga\u2019s lawyer Paul Mwangi, Supreme Court judge Isaac Lenaola, among others.\n\nThe class has a grouping called MV90 and Ms Wangari once did a video explaining the unique aspects of the group.\n\nA mother of three girls, Ms Wangari had a divorce in 2018. She told the Business Daily in a 2022 interview that the divorce affected her.\n\n\u201cI asked God questions,\u201d she said. \u201cI have done many successful projects, overseen successful investments in this bank that run in a trillion, but why couldn\u2019t I make my marriage succeed? How come this project failed?\u201d\n\nIn the interview, she also spoke of the need for women to be financially independent so that in case something goes wrong in their marriages, they have a way out.\n\nHer Nairobi residence is proof that she has established herself financially, and in a recent interview in the palatial residence, where she spoke about her love for books, she was happy to show the Business Daily her home library, which has quite a collection of books.\n\nMs Wangari has lately been giving mentorship sessions about money and investments, and she said she is reading a lot on the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing quite a lot of mentorship on that,\u201d she said. \u201c[Books] help me to consolidate my thoughts around that topic\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead people when I mentor them, because sometimes they take what you say as the gospel truth.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Ms Wangari released her biography The Village Girl: My Dream, Life and Legacy where she set out her story in full, candidly capturing the moments in her life that needed her to be resilient and to show leadership. Her policy is that biographies should not always be about the good things that happen to people.\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency to only tell the good things,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a book is written in a way that it only depicts the good part of it, either the good part of an individual or the good things that happen to them, then of course we have question marks: Is it real? Is it authentic? That is why now people are looking for authentic stories because an authentic and balanced story will talk about the peaks, but it will also talk about the lows.\u201d\n\nShe practised as a lawyer for 13 years before joining Equity Group, seeing it transform into the regional behemoth it is today.\n\nMs Wangari started a reading club for women at the bank, called the Equity Inspire Programme (Equip), as she sought to prepare female bankers for leadership roles.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the programme is to encourage them and help them to equip themselves with the right skills, the right knowledge, the right confidence to lead in a bank and financial services group like Equity,\u201d she told the Business Daily.",
        "summary": "As she charts the next path after leaving the board of directors of Equity Group Holdings, Mary Wangari Wamae will be opening a fresh chapter in her rich personal story.\nBesides the long-serving CEO James Mwangi and the founder and former chairman Peter Munga, Ms Wamae is perhaps the only other prominent personality who has shaped the history of Equity Bank.\nMs Wamae is certainly one of the authors of Equity's recent success story, which started with a remarkable turnaround that saw Equity miraculously escape dissolution by the regulator after years of operating under insolvency.\nA conglomerate with business interests spanning different sectors, Equity Group would become the first company in the region to cross the Sh1 trillion in assets in 2020.\nMs Wangari has lately been giving mentorship sessions about money and investments, and she said she is reading a lot on the topic.",

        "body": "Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firms Williamson Tea and Kapchorua Tea have called for the destruction of huge stocks of unsold tea held by the giant Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to save the industry from being choked by excess supplies of the commodity which has hurt prices.\n\nThe two tea firms, which share majority owners, said in separate financial filings on Friday that tea prices have fallen to unsustainable levels as a result of market saturation, while also hitting out at the minimum pricing system that has hit producers who are unable to supply top grade tea.\n\nIn 2022, the State set a minimum price of $2.43(Sh 314.73) per kilogramme on KTDA to safeguard farmers\u2019 earnings. Farmers affiliated with KTDA account for about 60 percent of Kenya\u2019s tea production.\n\nImproved production, coupled with a weaker shilling in 2023, helped Kapchorua and Williamson Tea book higher revenue in the year to March 2024, but they say that future profits are under threat due to the current situation at the auction.\n\nWilliamson Tea\u2019s net profit for the period fell by 6.6 percent to Sh527 million, as higher costs ate into a 4.4 percent increase in revenue to Sh4.19 billion. Kapchorua\u2019s net profit rose by 27 percent to Sh399.4 million, as its top-line revenue jumped 23.7 percent to Sh2.19 billion. Both are paying a final dividend of Sh15 per share, which when added to their interim dividends of Sh10 per share paid out earlier, brings their total dividend in the year to March to Sh25 per share.\n\n\u201cDespite the positive results of the period, the prospects for the company and Kenyan tea industry are dire. Tea prices have declined to unsustainable levels in the face of market saturation and the consequences of an estimated 200 million kilogrammes of unsold KTDA teas,\u201d said Williamson Tea in its financial report for the year ended March 2024.\n\n\u201cDramatic action is required to enable the market to return to a normal dynamic and for prospects to improve. The destruction of all unsold KTDA teas and the removal of the auction minimum pricing system is needed with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe Mombasa auction runs on a two-day format where secondary-grade quality tea is sold on Mondays and premium-grade ones on Tuesdays.\n\nAny tea that is not sold on a scheduled auction day is reprinted on a fresh auction catalogue and returned to the auction two weeks later. A seller is only allowed to bring back unsold crops to the auction twice.\n\nAny crop unsold after two auction trials is relegated to a sale window referred to as a \u201cpassive window\u201d where produce fetches low pricing on perceived low quality.\n\nWith the minimum price in place, buyers shun lower quality tea\u2014which they are unwilling to buy at the higher minimum price\u2014 leading to a rise in unsold stock at a time when production has gone up due to favourable weather.",

Therefore, all the issues around rice, juice, furniture, eggs, chicken, and sugar are now resolved.\u201d\n\nBrookside Limited, owned by parent company Brookside Dairy of Kenya, however, said it is among the most affected businesses, with up to 114 export permits denied by the Kenya Dairy Board since March last year.\n\n\u201cWe were delighted to read the communique signed by the two countries when the two heads of State met in Nairobi, as we believe it was key to unlocking trade barriers that have existed since March last year. However, a month later, we are yet to receive export permits for our long-life milk, which includes powder and ultra-high temperature (UHT) processed milk,\u201d Benson Mwangi, Brookside Limited\u2019s general manager, told a media briefing in Kampala last week.\n\nAlthough Kenya has been Uganda\u2019s main market for dairy products, emerging trade restrictions have seen Kampala search for new markets, mainly in North and West Africa.\n\nMr Mwangi said Brookside Limited had written several reminders to the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) on the pending permit applications.\n\nStill, unfortunately, no response has been received so far from the regulator. \u201cWe are optimistic that KDB could soon implement the tenets of the communique by the two heads of state, which would unlock the impasse and allow us to resume export of our products,\u201d Mr Mwangi said.\n\nEast African Community (EAC) Customs Union Protocol, the bloc\u2019s first integration breakthrough which came into force in 2005, allows the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour within the bloc.\n\nThe seven-member trading has, however, continued to experience unending trade tiffs, slowing growth in intra-regional trade despite the bloc being the most integrated in Africa.\n\nImports from Tanzania, for instance, fell by a third (32.69 percent) in the first quarter of 2023 to Sh7.99 billion when Dar es Salaam restricted sale of grains to neighbouring countries.\n\nThe measures were part of food export restrictions which Dar es Salaam started enforcing in 2022 to ensure food security in a trading bloc that perennially experiences deficit in maize, a staple.",

The feature allows conveners to connect to audiences, share ideas as well as gather feedback.\n\nIt allows for a maximum of up to 13 speakers including the host and two co-hosts at any given time, while the number of listeners who can join is unlimited.\n\nAt the height of the anti-Finance Bill protests, organisers shattered records by setting up interactions that saw listeners hit highs of over 130,000, demonstrating the efficiency of the platform to gather mass audiences of diverse walks of life using minimal resources.\n\nUnveiled in December 2020 to encourage individuals and businesses to build more personal connections with their audiences, the feature which acts like a virtual room allows users to have live audio conversations.\n\nOther rival offerings, which have not gained as much traction, include Meta\u2019s beta app for Oculus Rift which allows Facebook friends to hang out in virtual reality as well as WhatsApp channels and WhatsApp communities which are close-knit group tools used to organise and manage conversations.\n\nAccording to digital marketing strategist Egline Samoei, X emerged as an effective tool for mobilisation during the protests because of its open structure that allows prioritisation of topics in feeds as opposed to individual relationships between interacting accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open and public platform in that you don\u2019t have to be friends with someone to view their postings hence the content reaches as many people as possible,\u201d she opines.\n\n\u201cX Spaces has proven to be a powerful feature on X. Businesses can leverage this feature for brand awareness, driving engagements and community-building conversations around products to provide a deeper level understanding which will in turn foster brand loyalty,\u201d she adds noting that the engagements are also fertile ground from which businesses would pick valuable customer insights.\n\nHer sentiments are echoed by Dennis Maina, managing partner at digital marketing agency Suss Digital Africa, who calls on marketers to stay adaptive and forward-thinking.\n\n\u201cThe digital marketing landscape is in a constant state of flux, and success lies in the ability to not just ride the waves but to anticipate and leverage the currents that propel the industry forward,\u201d he states. \u201cMarketers need to ensure each interaction contributes to a unified brand image and a consistent narrative.\u201d\n\nOther gains derived from hosting the conversations include increased visibility on the general platform, helping businesses network with relevant influencers, offering an opening to demonstrate expertise as a specialised authority as well as strengthening relationships with customers.\n\nBut how do you amass the numbers?\n\nThe pundits explain that the first step is always building a strong community that discusses topics of collective interest, while also taking care to occasionally throw in themes around general trends to sustain interest.\n\nAccording to Ms Samoei, one of the key primary challenges that businesses seeking to pursue the route will grapple with is maintaining a consistency of high-quality topics that keep audiences engaged throughout.\n\n\u201cAlso, since the x Spaces is public, one may face brand hijacking or brand safety issues. It\u2019s worth mentioning that sometimes the X Space may experience glitches making the Spaces inaccessible for some users,\u201d she states.",

        "body": "I fondly remember an opportunity in telecommunications where a local telco was struggling with the implementation of service and risked going over budget and being out of allocated time. Their partner in the project was a large multinational organisation that had deployed similar solutions for a handful of other peers in different markets.\n\nBy all measures, ambition, and logic, this should have been a walk in the park, with world-class infrastructure, fantastic pedigree in talent, and subscribed standards. What remained unaccounted for was the deep fragmentation in devices on the network at the time, meaning that suddenly the standard would not deliver. Enter naivety.\n\nWhen we think about the concept of disruption, we are inclined to imagine that it requires one to be well-versed in an industry, sector, product, service, or process. Shouldn't the best solutions come from those who understand the intricacies of the problem they are solving?\n\nAbsolutely! But sometimes, the biggest roadblock to innovation is not a lack of knowledge, but an acceptance of the status quo, better articulated as standards.\n\nIn this story, I tasked my team to think through possible solutions to the problem, with a deliberate decision made not to mention the \"problematic\u201d standard. To be clear, the issue was not in the standard itself, as it addressed the section of the market, but that its presence and prior deployment success blinded those on the project to any other options, including going back to the drawing board.\n\nIn a few weeks, across multiple sprints, the team delivered a solution that passed the test for problem fit, deployed, and scaled to great success.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may sound, the ability to look at a problem or opportunity through virgin eyes can many times be the differentiator in creating and unlocking value.\n\nLook at the innovations celebrated now. They may seem obvious after the fact but were most likely viewed as ludicrous at the beginning. You must question and interrogate how things have always been done, to either take a tangent and chart a new path or improve on the current one.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. Unchecked, naivety can be a recipe for disaster. While a clear-eyed view of the problem cum opportunity is essential, so is a healthy respect for the realities of the industry. Naivety can easily become a liability, potentially leading to wasted time, capital, and ultimately a failed venture.\n\nThe sweet spot lies in striking a balance. The ideal team might have a visionary outsider at the top tempered by seasoned industry veterans who can help navigate sector complexities, sidestepping critical mistakes and errors.\n\nUltimately, the key to unlocking the true power of disruption lies in recognising that the most transformative ideas often come from those who see the world a little differently. Naivety, combined with experience and respect for the playing field, can become the secret sauce that moves a startup from an audacious idea to an industry-changing force.",

        "body": "One of the most often reported forms of irritation is back pain. If you deal with back discomfort regularly, you undoubtedly already know a few standard preventative measures. You can take steps to improve your posture, stand up straight while moving, and make sure you're sitting comfortably in your chair while working.\n\nThere are the same number of vertebrates in each person's spine, regardless of height. And that's where the issue is. Taller people seem to have larger vertebrates, yet we may all have the same amount. However, the increase in size may not always correspond with an increase in width, which makes it more difficult for the core muscles to withstand the impacts of those longer levers and limbs.\n\nWhy tall people get back pain\n\n\u2022 Bad posture: tall people tend to slouch or adopt poor posture habits to accommodate their height, which can strain the back muscles and lead to discomfort or pain.\n\n\u2022 Injuries- tall people are prone to injuries, especially in sports where longer limbs mean a long distance to the ground.\n\n\u2022 Increased spinal stress- tall individuals often have longer spines, which can result in increased stress on spinal discs and vertebrae. This extra stress can contribute to conditions like herniated discs, spinal stenosis and other back issues.\n\n\u2022 Muscle imbalances- the musculature of tall individuals may be imbalanced due to their height, leading to certain muscles becoming overworked while others are underutilised.\n\n\u2022 Joint strain- Tall people may experience increased strain on their joints due to the longer lever arms in their limbs. This strain can affect the ligament of the spine and contribute to back problems.\n\n\u2022 Genetics- while height itself is not a direct cause of back problems, certain genetic factors that contribute to a person's height may also play a role in their susceptibility to back issues.\n\nPreventive measures to avoid back pain\n\n\u2022 Core and back-strengthening exercises.\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a good posture, sit and stand erect without slouching. Avoid looking down at your phone or other devices for extended periods. Keep your face forward as much as possible.\n\n\u2022 Also you can use a lumbar support cushion in your seat to prevent low back pain and find ways to keep the spine aligned while you sleep. That means getting a comfortable pillow, updating your mattress and sleeping on your sides rather than your stomach.\n\n\u2022 Drinking water also helps to hydrate your joints and keep them flexible.\n\n\u2022 Routine physiotherapy care can also prevent back problems from progressing.\n\nPhysiotherapy management of back pain\n\n\u2022Early activity, encouraging early movement in back pain is one of the significant aspects of treatment in back pain.\n\n\u2022 Specific stabilisation exercises, helps in improving strength and stability of the muscles which have been weakened due to back pain.\n\n\u2022 Postural guidelines, guiding the patient about correct postural habits and ways to maintain accurate posture and avoid back pain\n\n\u2022 Mobilisation or manipulative physiotherapy concentrates on promoting mobilisation of the specific affected area and is used to target the specific point of pain.\n\n\u2022 General exercises and stretches, structured exercises and stretches are usually carried out in the context of patients' individual condition and cause of back pain.\n\n\u2022 Ergonomic advice- since work-related hazards account for more than 65 percent of back problems, physiotherapists also concentrate on providing accurate ergonomic devices, guiding the patient using the appropriate infrastructure at work to avoid and cure back pain.",

        "title": "Down Syndrome: How can I tell if my child will have it?",
        "body": "Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two. Chromosomes are small \u201cpackages\" of genes in the body. They determine how a baby's body forms and functions as it grows in the womb and after birth.\n\nHere is more to this condition that you need to know about.\n\nHow it occurs\n\nA normal baby is born with 46 chromosomes (each cell contains 23 pairs), but babies with Down Syndrome have 47. This extra chromosome changes how the baby's body and brain develop, which can cause both mental and physical challenges for the baby. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal disorder.\n\nA person with Down Syndrome can be identified by their unique physical features, which include a flattened face, slanted eyes, a short neck, small ears, a tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth, small hands and feet and tiny spots on the iris of the eye. They also tend to be shorter in height than children and adults with poor muscle tone.\n\nClassical Down Syndrome is not an inherited condition. It usually occurs because of a chance happening at the time of conception. However, in rare cases, (less than 5 percent), some recombinant genetic errors can be transmitted from parents to their offspring. Increasing maternal age after 35 years is one of the known risk factors.\n\nDiagnosis during pregnancy\n\nThere are two tests available to detect Down Syndrome during pregnancy: screening tests and diagnostic tests. A screening test can tell a woman and her healthcare provider whether her pregnancy has a lower, or higher chance of having the condition, but it does not provide an absolute diagnosis. They are safer than diagnostic tests for the mother and the developing baby.\n\nScreening tests often include a combination of a blood test, which measures the amount of various substances in the mother's blood, and an ultrasound, which creates a picture of the baby. During an ultrasound, one of the things the technician looks at is the fluid behind the baby's neck. Extra fluid in this region could indicate a genetic problem.\n\nDiagnostic tests, on the other hand, can typically detect whether, or not a baby will have Down Syndrome, but they can be riskier for the mother and the developing baby.\n\nThese tests are usually performed after a positive screening test to confirm a Down Syndrome diagnosis by looking for changes in the chromosomes that would indicate the condition. This involves examining material from the placenta, the amniotic fluid and blood from the umbilical cord. Some of these tests may carry some risks depending on gestation and need to be discussed with the doctor.\n\nOther complications\n\nApart from its effects on appearance, Down Syndrome can cause a number of medical complications. Some of these are more serious than others, but most of them can be treated. The most serious complications include heart defects, blood disorders like Leukemia and immune system problems.\n\nApproximately half of all babies with Down Syndrome are born with heart defects. Usually, these defects affect the walls separating the four chambers of the heart. The condition can also cause blood cell abnormalities such as leukaemia.\n\nThe immune system of people with Down Syndrome is compromised and they are more vulnerable to infections, certain kinds of cancer and autoimmune conditions.\n\nThey also suffer from stomach and digestive problems including abnormally formed digestive organs that may require surgery and celiac disease, a condition that impairs their ability to absorb nutrients, especially gluten.\n\nDown Syndrome can affect the way the body produces or responds to hormones causing hormonal disorders that contribute to obesity problems and Type 1 diabetes. People with Down Syndrome also suffer from skeletal problems caused by too much flexibility between the bones at the top of the spine that support the head.\n\nOther less serious complications include intellectual disability, vision problems, hearing impairment, skin disorders, behavioural and psychological problems, height and weight, sleep apnea and fertility problems, especially in men.\n\nIs Down Syndrome curable?\n\nThough there is no cure for Down Syndrome, there are services available to help babies and children improve their physical and intellectual abilities. The management requires a multidisciplinary medical team approach.",

        "body": "The National Housing Corporation (NHC) is stuck with hundreds of houses valued close to Sh1.3 billion it has been unable to sell, even as the government pumps more through its affordable housing programme.\n\nLatest details reveal that by June last year, the corporation had a stock of unsold houses across different parts of the country, some of which were completed years ago but have not attracted buyers.\n\n\u201cThe statement of financial position reflects an inventories balance of Sh1,305,018,402 which includes an amount of Sh1,275,730,014 relating to stock of unsold houses held by the Corporation. As previously reported, despite some of the projects having been completed several years ago, the houses have remained unsold and hence they continue to be reported as inventories,\u201d Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes in a report.\n\nNHC housing units sell at between Sh1.58million and Sh8.75million, depending on the size and location. For instance, a studio apartment under the affordable housing scheme retails at Sh1.58 million while the most expensive three-bedroom master ensuite unit goes for Sh8.75 million. Although the auditor-general does not specify the number of unsold units, projections show that they are in their hundreds going by the Sh1.3 billion total value.\n\nThis raises questions on how the State will market the thousands of houses it has lined up with billions of shillings already being pumped into the programme.\n\nPresident William Ruto continues to insist on the importance of the affordable housing project in the creation of jobs for youth but the government has been silent on how it will ensure the units are sold after completion, with the majority of targeted beneficiaries being low-income earners.\n\nFormally employed Kenyans have since July last year been deducted 1.5 percent of their salaries towards the Housing Levy Tax, with the amounts being channelled to the Housing Fund.\n\nBut the auditor-general now reveals that with the \u201cstock of unsold houses\" constructed over the years continuing to pile, NHC is now having to approach individuals and institutions to buy them, to no success.\n\n\u201cManagement explained that it has scaled up engagement with County Governments, Saccos, Kenyans in the diaspora, and other relevant institutions to market the unsold houses,\u201d Ms Gathungu says in her report on NHC.\n\nUnable to offload the houses to the market, NHC has been forced to rent out houses worth Sh843 million, but Sh433 million houses remain idle.\n\nOn its website, the NHC lists at least 10 projects where it has residential houses it is selling. They include Kisumu Kanyakwar, Phase Three where it has 100 houses, and Stoni in Athi River where it has 160 unsold affordable houses and 110 unsold affordable houses in Homa Bay.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, the Corporation may not have obtained value for money for the schemes implemented at Sh1,275,730,014 included under inventories,\u201d the audit notes.\n\nIn its expression of commitment to Housing, the government budgeted Sh92.1 billion to the sector for the fiscal year starting July, including Sh67.4 billion that will go to affordable and social housing.\n\nThis is more than thrice the Sh28 billion budget the government allocated to Housing in the 2023/24 fiscal year, though only Sh5.45 billion had been spent by the end of May.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s commitment is to turn the housing challenge into an economic opportunity to create quality jobs for the youth directly in the construction sector and indirectly through the production of building products,\u201d Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung\u2019u said while delivering the 2024/25 budget.\n\nThe government\u2019s plan- which has not been achieved so far- is to construct 200,000 houses every year.\n\nMPs recently blocked a plan by the Treasury to open up affordable houses for open sale in the market, amid objection by Kenyans who sensed a plot to let non-deserving rich people end up being beneficiaries of the houses meant for low-earners.\n\nTreasury had in the Finance Bill, 2024, proposed to amend the Affordable Housing Act to remove a requirement that owners of affordable houses seek approval from the affordable housing board prior to sale of their houses.\n\nThis risked leaving the houses free-for-all and selling at market prices, despite having been built on the back of taxpayers\u2019 money so that they can specifically benefit low-earners.\n\n\u201cThe Committee noted that the current provision in the Affordable Housing Act limits the right to property as enshrined in the Constitution and would be subject to abuse and therefore recommended deletion of the clause,\u201d the National Assembly\u2019s Finance and Planning Committee stated.\n\nSection 54 of the Affordable Housing Act, 2024- which Treasury wanted to delete- states \u201cExcept with the prior written consent of the Board, a purchaser of an affordable housing unit under this Act shall not by contract, agreement or otherwise, sell or agree to sell his or her unit or any interest therein to any other person.\u201d\n\nFollowing the proposal by the Treasury, Kenyans petitioned parliament objecting to the move, arguing that it risked creating a loophole that would be exploited by rich, non-deserving persons to own the houses.\n\n\u201cRepealing the section that prohibits buyers from selling affordable houses will lead to speculative purchases by the wealthy and well-connected, thereby excluding the citizens who are intended to be the primary and sole beneficiaries of the programme,\u201d a petitioner Kevin Wanambisi said.",

Fourth generation (4G) on the other hand, expanded its regional coverage from 52 percent to 62 percent where Kenya and Rwanda again led the way with close to or exceeding 97 percent.\n\nAt the same time, mobile data prices in the region were found to have fallen significantly over the three years to last year, further accelerating the adoption of mobile services.\n\n\u201cThe influx of low-cost smartphones from Chinese manufacturers has made mobile phones more accessible to a wider population. Increased competition among mobile network operators and government interventions have also driven down data costs, making internet access more affordable.\u201d\n\nAccording to EACO, innovations such as Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa have partly contributed to the penetration growth due to their heavy reliance on mobile telephony services.\n\nThe report indicates that mobile money subscribers in the region stood at 128.7 million, reflecting a 64 percent penetration rate.\n\nIn Kenya, the latest Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) data shows that the total number of mobile phone devices connected to mobile networks stood at 65.7 million as of the end of March, translating to a 127.5 percent penetration rate.",

Yet, it is the widespread outrage over the contentious Finance Bill 2024 that truly galvanised the nation, drawing intense scrutiny and support both domestically and globally.\n\nThese protests have made history with their groundbreaking use of technology to rally and unite citizens beyond traditional tribal divisions.\n\nThe innovativeness, boldness, and resilience of Kenyan Gen Zs and millennials in activism tactics are noteworthy. Technology and social media played crucial roles in enabling broader participation in political discourse, increasing scrutiny of government actions, and empowering a demographic that challenged traditional power structures.\n\nScores of citizens voiced their frustration, anger, disappointment, opposition, and demands online and organised nationwide protests using hashtags like #EndFemicideKe, #TotalShutdownKenya, #RejectFinanceBill2024, and #OccupyParliament on social media platforms such as TikTok and X. Online petition platforms like Change.org (against the Finance Bill) and Avaaz.org (against femicide) were also used to rally public support.\n\nThe year began with massive demonstrations against femicide, driven by alarming statistics and a demand for stronger legal protections and enforcement. January and February saw some of the largest protests in Kenya\u2019s history, with women and allies marching to demand justice for victims and stricter laws to protect women.\n\nLed predominantly by young women and feminists, including many Nguvu Change Leaders playing different roles, these protests highlighted systemic gender-based violence and the need for legislative reforms to ensure the safety of women and equality.\n\nIn April, protests erupted over unfair demolitions and evictions following severe flooding, which disproportionately affected vulnerable communities. The evictions were deemed inhumane as many felt brutalised and were left without an alternative place to relocate to, no fair compensation, sufficient notice, or proper consultation.\n\nThese protests mark a turning point for Kenya, heralding a new era of collective action and political and social accountability in Kenya that has reshaped public discourse and policy direction.\n\nThey reflect deep-seated discontent and growing disillusionment among young Kenyans with existing policies that overlook public participation and fail to address urgent national issues. There is a demand for youth and women to have a meaningful role in shaping the future, not just demanding change but actively steering its course.\n\nThe government\u2019s response was criticised as selective and punitive, prompting calls for fairer environmental policies and better disaster management.\n\nThe most recent wave of protests has been driven by opposition to the Finance Bill 2024, which proposed significant tax hikes. These demonstrations, marked by a diverse demographic including millennials and mostly Gen Z participants, showcased widespread economic discontent.\n\nThe proposed tax increases were seen as burdensome, especially for the younger population struggling with unemployment and economic instability.\n\nThe outcome, which saw President Ruto conceding, underscores the growing influence of young people and women in national affairs, though their voices and concerns are often excluded from top decision-making. This has widened the gap between the government and disillusioned citizens who have lost faith and trust in leadership.\n\nIn supporting and amplifying these transformative movements, the younger generation and women, civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the government have pivotal roles to play. CSOs can provide the necessary organizational infrastructure, resources, and advocacy training to sustain the momentum of these protests, ensuring that young voices are heard and their demands are met.\n\nThe media, as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, can continue to spotlight these movements, foster informed debate, and hold those in power accountable. Meanwhile, the government must embrace a collaborative approach, engaging in constructive dialogue with these young activists and stakeholders to co-create policies and solutions that reflect the diverse interests of all Kenyans.\n\nTogether, these efforts can pave the way for long-term solutions, fostering a more equitable and just society where every Kenyan, especially the youth and women, can thrive and participate meaningfully in shaping the nation's future.",

        "body": "The Kenyan online gambling market is experiencing a significant transformation with the integration of cryptocurrency. This trend is opening new opportunities for both players and operators. Understanding the dynamics behind this shift is crucial for staying ahead in the industry.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency in the online gambling sector has been nothing short of revolutionary. For many, the allure lies in the increased security and anonymity that digital currencies provide.\n\nAs a result, Kenya's online gambling market, projected to be significant with estimates suggesting a value close to $100 million in 2024, is poised to benefit from this growing trend.\n\nThe number of online gamblers in Kenya is also expected to rise, with Statista predicting 402,000 online sports betting users and 85,000 online casino users by 2029.\n\nHow cryptocurrency is reshaping the Kenyan gambling landscape\n\nCryptocurrency, with its decentralised nature, offers a level of transparency and security that traditional currencies struggle to match. For players in Kenya, this means safer transactions and lower risks of fraud. In the middle of this shift, you find the intriguing concept of a crypto casino, which blends modern digital currency with conventional gaming platforms.\n\nAdopting cryptocurrencies also means that transactions can be processed faster compared to traditional banking methods. This efficiency is particularly appealing to younger generations who are accustomed to the instant gratification provided by digital technologies. It is essential for operators to recognise this shift and adapt accordingly.\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrencies can help mitigate issues related to currency exchange rates and transaction fees, making it easier for international players to participate in Kenyan online casinos. This global reach not only broadens the player base but also increases revenue streams for operators willing to embrace these digital currencies. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies also aligns well with the increasing demand for provably fair gaming.\n\nBlockchain technology, which underpins most digital currencies, allows for transparent and tamper-proof record-keeping. This means that players can verify the fairness of games independently, fostering a sense of trust between the operator and the player. As more Kenyans become aware of these benefits, the adoption of cryptocurrency in online gambling is likely to accelerate.\n\nThe relevance of cryptocurrency in modern online casinos\n\nOne of the key benefits of integrating cryptocurrency into online gambling platforms is the enhanced privacy it offers users. For many Kenyan players, the ability to gamble without revealing personal banking information is a significant advantage. In addition, digital currencies often come with lower transaction fees, making them an economical option for frequent gamers. You can see this in action on platforms like Bombastic Casino which represents a dynamic and exuberant shift towards modern gaming solutions that cater to these financial advantages.\n\nAnother critical factor driving the adoption of cryptocurrency is its potential for reducing operational costs for casino operators. Lower transaction fees and faster processing times mean that casinos can operate more efficiently, potentially passing on these savings to their customers in the form of better odds or higher payouts.\n\nThis integration also opens up new marketing opportunities. By accepting cryptocurrencies, online casinos can appeal to a broader audience that includes tech-savvy individuals and early adopters of new technologies. This strategic move can significantly enhance customer loyalty and engagement, further driving growth in Kenya's already substantial online gambling market.\n\nThe use of cryptocurrencies also enables online casinos to offer a wider range of games and betting options. The fast transaction speeds and low fees associated with digital currencies make it feasible for operators to provide micro-betting opportunities and high-frequency games. This flexibility can be a significant draw for players looking for diverse and exciting gaming experiences, further boosting the appeal of Kenyan online casinos that adopt cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat players need to know about using cryptocurrency in gambling\n\nFor players considering using cryptocurrency at Kenyan online casinos, understanding how these digital currencies work is crucial. Consider the following:\n\nSafe Storage: Get a secure digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency safely. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption.\n\nGet a secure digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency safely. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption. Cryptocurrency Options: Find out which cryptocurrencies the casino accepts. Bitcoin is popular, but others like Ethereum and Litecoin are gaining traction. Each has its own benefits and transaction speeds.\n\nFind out which cryptocurrencies the casino accepts. Bitcoin is popular, but others like Ethereum and Litecoin are gaining traction. Each has its own benefits and transaction speeds. Market Volatility: Be aware that the value of cryptocurrency can change quickly. This can impact your winnings or losses. Stay informed about market trends to manage these risks.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency in Kenya's gambling industry\n\nThe integration of cryptocurrency into Kenya's online gambling market represents a significant step forward for the industry. As more operators adopt these digital currencies, it is likely that we will see continued growth and innovation within this sector. Players will benefit from increased security, privacy and convenience while enjoying their favourite games.\n\nMoreover, as regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate cryptocurrencies, we can expect a more structured and secure environment for all stakeholders involved. This evolution will be crucial in ensuring sustainable growth and maintaining player trust in the long run.",

On a conference call on Sunday, one official is said to have been asked by a family member how he sleeps at night.\n\nRelatives were briefed on the terms of the proposed deal during the call: Boeing would pay a fine, face a three-year term of probation, and work under a corporate monitor, according to two sources.\n\nThe terms unleashed a wave of anger. \u201cThe memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\u201d said Paul Cassell, who represents the families of 15 crash victims.\n\nErin Applebaum, another attorney acting for relatives of those lost, attacked the proposal as \u201cshameful\u201d and said it \u201ccompletely fails to mention or recognize the dignity\u201d of the victims.\n\nThe families will make the case to a judge, and the wider public, for this deal to be rejected, Applebaum said. \u201cAnd when there is inevitably another Boeing crash and DoJ seeks to assign blame, they will have nowhere else to look but in the mirror.\u201d\n\nThe justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two crashes of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, in October 2018 and March 2019, killed 346 people.

This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.\n\nEurope\u2019s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.\n\nSimon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers \u00a32,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "London\u2019s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.\n\nDemand for investment banking services \u2013 such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds \u2013 was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.\n\nBut the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,\u201d Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.\n\nThat is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of \u201cbulge bracket\u201d firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s more of a an upswing happening,\u201d the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. \u201cEven if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.\u201d\n\nNaidu said the UK\u2019s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. \u201cWhat might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.\u201d\n\nThere is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.\n\nDartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.\n\nWhile lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of \u00a344,267 in 2023 \u2013 marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier \u2013 mid-tier associates\u2019 bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to \u00a380,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to \u00a3213,940.\n\nMeanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to \u00a3135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to \u00a3303,204.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers \u2013 working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America \u2013 found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.\n\nBut even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.\n\nIf it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.\n\nThe turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.\n\nThey asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.\n\nAXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.\n\nST, Gloucester\n\nThe premium package you purchased promised \u201cunforgettable seats\u201d along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. \u201cUnforgettable\u201d, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.\n\nAE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over \u00a31,320 for two.\n\nFeedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.\n\n\u201cFrom the row we\u2019ve been allocated, it looks as though we\u2019ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold \u2013 with a view of the stage \u2013 but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.\u201d\n\nOther furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.\n\nSeats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it\u2019s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.\n\nNeither AXS nor its sister \u00adcompany AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don\u2019t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.\n\nST\u2019s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.\n\nAE\u2019s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. \u201cIf the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,\u201d he says. \u201cA cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.\u201d\n\nOn the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk.

        "title": "General Election 2024: Five things the main parties aren't talking about this election",
        "body": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says there's a conspiracy of silence at this election - that all of the major political parties aren't being honest enough about their fiscal plans.\n\nAnd it has a point. Most obviously (and this is the main thing the IFS is complaining about) none of the major manifestos - from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative parties - have been clear about how they will fill an impending black hole in the government's spending plans.\n\nNo need to go into all the gritty details, but the overarching point is that all government spending plans include some broad assumptions about how much spending (and for that matter, taxes and economic growth) will grow in the coming years. Economists call this the \"baseline\".\n\nBut there's a problem with this baseline - it assumes quite a slow increase in overall government spending in the next four years, an average of about 1 per cent a year after accounting for inflation. Which doesn't sound too bad - except that we all know from experience that NHS spending always grows more quickly than that, and that 1% needs to accommodate all sorts of other promises, like increasing schools and defence spending and so on.\n\nImage: NHS spending grows more quickly than the 'baseline'\n\nIf all those bits of government are going to consume quite a lot of that extra money (far more than a 1% increase, certainly) then other bits of government won't get as much. In fact, the IFS reckons those other bits of government - from the Home Office to the legal system - will face annual cuts of 3.5 per cent. In other words, it's austerity all over again.\n\nBut here's the genius thing (for the politicians, at least). While they have to set a baseline, to make all their other sums add up, the dysfunctional nature of the way government sets its spending budgets means it only has to fill in the small print about which department gets what when it does a spending review. And that spending review isn't due until after the election.\n\nThe upshot is all the parties can pretend they've signed up to the baseline even when it's patently obvious that more money will be needed for those unprotected departments (or else it's a return to austerity).\n\nSo yes, the IFS is right: the numbers in each manifesto, including Labour's, are massively overshadowed by this other bigger conspiracy of silence.\n\nBut I would argue that actually the conspiracy of silence goes even deeper. Because it's not just fiscal baselines we're not talking about enough. Consider five other issues none of the major parties are confronting (when I say major parties, in this case I'm talking about the Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem manifestos - to some extent the Green and Reform manifestos are somewhat less guilty of these particular sins, even if they commit others).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nTaxes going up\n\nFirst, for all their promises not to raise any of the major tax rates (something Labour, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have all committed to) the reality is taxes are going up. We will all be paying more in taxes by the end of the parliament compared with today.\n\nIndeed, we'll all be paying more income tax. Except that we'll be paying more of it because we'll be paying tax on more of our income - that's the inexorable logic of freezing the thresholds at which you start paying certain rates of tax (which is what this government has done - and none of the other parties say they'll reverse).\n\nSecond, the main parties might say they believe in different things, but they all seem to believe in one particular offbeat religion: the magic tax avoidance money tree. All three of these manifestos assume they will make enormous sums - more, actually, than from any single other money-raising measure - from tightening up tax avoidance rules.\n\nWhile it's perfectly plausible that you could raise at least some money from clamping down on tax avoidance, it's hardly a slam-dunk. That this is the centrepiece of each party's money-raising efforts says a lot. And, another thing that's often glossed over: raising more money this way will also raise the tax burden.\n\nImage: Should the Bank of England be paying large sums in interest to banks? File pic: AP\n\nThird is another thing all the parties agree on and are desperate not to question: the fiscal rules. The government has a set of rules requiring it to keep borrowing and (more importantly given where the numbers are right now) total debt down to a certain level.\n\nBut here's the thing. These rules are not god-given. They are not necessarily even all that good. The debt rule is utterly gameable. It hasn't stopped the Conservatives from raising the national debt to the highest level in decades. And it's not altogether clear the particular measure of debt being used (net debt excluding Bank of England interventions) is even the right one.\n\nWhich raises another micro-conspiracy. Of all the parties at this election, the only one talking about whether the Bank of England should really be paying large sums in interest to banks as it winds up its quantitative easing programme is the Reform Party. This policy, first posited by a left-wing thinktank (the New Economics Foundation), is something many economists are discussing. It's something the Labour Party will quite plausibly carry out to raise some extra money if it gets elected. But no one wants to discuss it. Odd.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBrexit impact\n\nAnyway, the fourth issue everyone seems to have agreed not to discuss is, you've guessed it, Brexit. While the 2019 election was all about Brexit, this one, by contrast, has barely featured the B word. Perhaps you're relieved. For a lot of people we've talked so much about Brexit over the past decade or so that, frankly, we need a bit of a break. That's certainly what the main parties seem to have concluded.\n\nBut while the impact of leaving the European Union is often overstated (no, it's not responsible for every one of our economic problems) it's far from irrelevant to our economic plight. And where we go with our economic neighbours is a non-trivial issue in the future.\n\nAnyway, this brings us to the fifth and final thing no one is talking about. The fact that pretty much all the guff spouted on the campaign trail is completely dwarfed by bigger international issues they seem reluctant or ill-equipped to discuss. Take the example of China and electric cars.\n\nImage: Brexit has barely featured in the election. File pic: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nJust recently, both the US and European Union have announced large tariffs on the import of Chinese EVs. Now, in America's case those tariffs are primarily performative (the country imports only a tiny quantity of Chinese EVs). But in Europe's case, Chinese EVs are a very substantial part of the market - same for the UK.\n\nRaising the question: what is the UK going to do? You could make a strong case for saying Britain should be emulating the EU and US, in an effort to protect the domestic car market. After all, failing to impose tariffs will mean this country will have a tidal wave of cars coming from China (especially since they can no longer go to the rest of the continent without facing tariffs) which will make it even harder for domestic carmakers to compete. And they're already struggling to compete.\n\nBy the same token, imposing tariffs will mean the cost of those cheap Chinese-made cars (think: MGs, most Teslas and all those newfangled BYDs and so on) will go up. A lot. Is this really the right moment to impose those extra costs on consumers?\n\nIn short, this is quite a big issue. Yet it hasn't come up as a big issue in this campaign - which is madness. But then you could say the same thing about, say, the broader race for minerals, about net zero policy more widely and about how we're going to go about tightening up sanctions on Russia to make them more effective.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Enormous gaps. The \"conspiracy of silence\" goes way, way beyond the stuff the IFS has talked about.\n\nBut 'twas ever thus.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy the US is imposing 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars\n\nRapid steps needed for Britain to compete in green revolution\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThink back to the last time a political party actually confronted some long-standing issues no one wanted to talk about in their manifesto. I'm talking about the 2017 Conservative manifesto, which pledged to resolve the mess of social care in this country, once and for all.\n\nIt sought to confront a big social issue, intergenerational inequality, in so doing ensuring younger people wouldn't have to subsidise the elderly.\n\nThe manifesto was an absolute, abject, electoral disaster. It was largely responsible for Theresa May's slide in the polls from a 20-point lead to a hung parliament.\n\nAnd while most people don't talk about that manifesto anymore, make no mistake: today's political strategists won't forget it in a hurry. Hence why this year's campaign and this year's major manifestos are so thin.\n\nElections are rarely won on policy proposals. But they are sometimes lost on them.",

        "title": "Cameco: Spanning The Uranium & Nuclear Value Chain (NYSE:CCJ)",
        "body": "MD MARUF HASSAN/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe energy transition from CO2-emitting coal/gas to \"clean\" energy has sparked a nuclear rebirth as the most efficient clean electricity source and has driven uranium prices in the last two years, with expectations of long-term deficits prompting higher price expectations. To invest in this theme, I researched two uranium ETFs, Global X Uranium (URA) and Sprott Uranium Miners (URNM) where Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) (TSX:CCO:CA) was the top holding and thus decided to analyze the company and found it more compelling.\n\nPerformance\n\nCameco's share price performance mirrors uranium spot prices and has been a terrible long-term investment given the resistance to nuclear energy in the last 20 years. However, vs a portfolio of uranium stocks via the URA ETF, Cameco has done far better at capturing uranium prices. I was also curious to see how the stock faired vs clean energy companies. I compared it to Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), which is in a JV with Cameco that co-owns Westinghouse, and versus a large utility such as NextEra Energy (NEE). Using prices adjusted for dividends (total return) one can see that Cameco recuperated from 10 years of losses in 2023.\n\nFactSet Created by author with data from Capital IQ\n\nWhat is Cameco\n\nCameco, based in Canada, is the second-largest uranium miner in the world with 15% capacity, behind National Atomic Company Kazatomprom (OTC:NATKY). It also refines and produces fuel rods for nuclear power plants that represent 16% of revenue. In late 2024 Cameco acquired 49% of Westinghouse (51% Brookfield Renewable Partners), further extending its integration and exposure in the value chain to nuclear power plant maintenance and new builds.\n\nThe company has three main mining operations with McArthur River (70% stake) and Cigar Lake (55% stake) in Canada that have 43m lbs. capacity and should run at 83% utilization in 2024 up from 66% in 2023. The third, Inkai (40% stake), is in Kazakhstan with 18m lbs. capacity and is not consolidated, i.e., reported as equity income. The fuel service operation refines uranium and produces fuel rods, mostly for the Canadian nuclear fleet.\n\nCameco Mining Assets (Cameco)\n\nContracted Prices vs. Spot Market\n\nCameco\u00b4s realized uranium price (revenue/volume) does not directly track the spot price due to the company's commercial strategy which, utilizes a 40/60% fixed/variable price mix for long-term contacts. However, at present, about 20% of reserves or 200m lbs are in this contract terms, which means that higher prices and volumes should produce a gradual and sustainable price catch-up.\n\nThe company provided a sensitivity guideline where the realized price climbs from US$56 to US$69lb if spot prices are flat at US$80lb.\n\nCreated by author with data from Cameco Uranium Price Guidance (Cameco)\n\nWestinghouse Nuclear\n\nWhat is a new factor in the Cameco investment case is the 49% stake in Westinghouse Nuclear, a leader in nuclear plant design, construction, and maintenance. This was acquired in 4Q23 for US$2.3bn in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. This provides Cameco with further integration in the nuclear value chain and may be a very positive source of earnings growth and diversification, reducing the dependence on uranium prices. According to Cameco\u00b4s 2024 guidance for Westinghouse they expect to report a net loss of $200m and from one report by Goldman Sachs (GS) earnings recovery to $500m in 2025.\n\nWestinghouse has built 430 reactors and has developed the AP1000, with 4 in operation with 26 in construction or contracted. It has also developed an SMR (Small Modular Rector) and a Microreactor that may provide additional upside if deployed.\n\nCameco Cameco SMR (Cameco) Westinghouse Guidance (Cameco)\n\nEquity Income Increasingly Relevant\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Westinghouse results are reported as equity income, i.e. the earnings proportional to the equity stake. These results are not added to revenue or EBITDA and unless the JVs pay dividends, equity income does not provide cash flow. Nonetheless, it is a clear indication of the JV's growth and value to Cameco. Many analysts will add equity income to EBITDA in their EV/EBITDA valuation metric, which, in my view, is not the best way to capture a JVs contribution. Below, I break down EBT (Earnings before Tax) for Cameco and its JVs to illustrate their importance.\n\nCreated by author with data from Capital IQ & Bloomberg\n\nConsensus Estimates over 30% Earnings Growth\n\nI gathered consensus data from 14 analysts to measure Cameco's growth and profitability metrics, which for the most part factor in the company guidance for 2024, which assumes more than doubling EBITDA margin on stronger uranium prices. For 2025 and 2026 the market expects margins to increase to 60% on higher volumes and prices as discussed earlier on Cameco\u00b4s contract commercial terms. Earnings get a further boost from Westinghouse equity income contribution where analysts have less clarity, but some are forecasting over US$500m or US$250m to Cameco which seems under-estimated and may provide for earnings upgrades.\n\nCameco Consensus Estimates (Created by author with data from Capital IQ)\n\nValuation\n\nThe consensus has a US$56 price target that backs into an implied PE (cash) of 52x and a PEG of 1.9 which are premium valuations but not out of context with historic ranges. Note that I use cash earnings for capital-intensive companies, which is calculated with net income plus depreciation. In the case of Cameco this metric includes its substantial equity income, the earnings from Westinghouse and Inkai mine in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe 2025 price target of US$77 is based on a 1.5x PEG that, given the increasing earnings growth, translates into a 51x cash PE ratio. The same methodology points to a US$100 price target for YE26 on the company's continuing growth and profitability drivers.\n\nConsensus Valuation (Created by author with data from Capital IQ )\n\nPeers\n\nI gathered consensus data for some of the top uranium producers to compare to Cameco's growth and valuation metrics. As can be seen in the table below, quality is scarce in the sector with Kazatomprom's production and geopolitical issues, the rest are junior miners initiating production with substantial execution risk. The more adventurous investor may find Paladin Energy (OTCQX:PALAF) and Boss Energy (OTCQX:BQSSF) an interesting option, judging from consensus data. CGN is a Chinese-listed company.\n\nCreated by author with data from Capital IQ & Bloomberg\n\nRisk\n\nThe primary risk is a declining uranium price, which may occur if the nuclear reactor expansion stops and even reverses. That scenario seems unlikely given the energy transition, and climate change action to reduce carbon emissions but could be driven by new energy technologies. The other factor that could lead to lower uranium prices in the long term is oversupply as dormant mines and then new mines come into production, i.e., a classic commodity cycle. Cameco\u00b4s valuation premium vs Kazatomprom could decline in that scenario.\n\nConclusion\n\nI rate CCJ a BUY. The company is at the center of the nuclear rebirth that has favorable short and long-term growth expectations that should provide support for uranium prices, if not drive them higher. At the same time, the 49% stake in Westinghouse provides additional integration in the nuclear value chain via the design, construction, and services of nuclear power plants. The combination points to over 30% earnings growth through 2026.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "body": "Torsten Asmus\n\nThe big question mark on many investors' minds this year has been what will happen with interest rates? When will the Fed decide to lower interest rates, and how will the timing of that decision impact my investments? Back in January, it was starting to look like rate cuts were imminent, and I even wrote an article cautioning against investing in a floating rate senior loan fund at the time, which turned out to be way too early. That article was about the Invesco Senior Income Trust (VVR), and I wrote, When Interest Rates Fall, Time To Bail. I rated VVR a Hold and since that article was published the fund has delivered a total return of 11.35%, nearly matching the S&P 500 change of 12.8%. I had posited at the time that when interest rates start to fall, those senior loans would pay less in interest payments, affecting the NII of the fund.\n\nI still believe that thesis to be true and correct, but the timing of my call was off because the Fed was nowhere near reducing rates back in January. Now that we are about to start the month of July, there is still no indication that rate cuts are imminent, and likely not before September, if then. One fund that I recently came across is a relatively new ETF that offers a hedge against higher for longer interest rates, and it offers a nice return along with portfolio protection against rate risk. The ETF has a rather fancy name of FolioBeyond Alternative Income and Interest Rate Hedge ETF (NYSEARCA:RISR).\n\nThis ETF is not what I would consider a buy and hold and never check back on it again, fund. The fund had an inception date of 9/30/21 so it has not yet experienced a time when interest rates were falling. But the fund has performed extremely well since inception and offers a current 7% yield based on holdings of AAA rated investments that include US Treasuries and MBS (mortgage-backed securities).\n\nI like RISR as a portfolio hedge against interest rates that are due to stay higher for longer, and one that offers a nice monthly income stream along with potential price appreciation until rates do eventually get cut. But similar to VVR, I would be looking to sell, or at least downgrade to a Hold and stop adding shares of RISR once the Fed does announce the first interest rate reduction.\n\nRISR is a \u201cQuantamental\u201d Fund\n\nFrom the fund website describing the fund strategy and positioning:\n\nRISR is a \u201cquantamental\u201d, actively managed, scalable strategy which is positioned as a Diversifier for an existing fixed income portfolio regardless of one\u2019s views on rates Hedge for a fixed income allocation for those concerned about rising rates and who seek to shorten a portfolio\u2019s duration without selling existing positions Means of expressing a directional view for those who seek a vehicle designed to profit from rising rates\n\nIn other words, RISR can offer diversification in the fixed income portion of one\u2019s portfolio while providing a hedge against higher interest rates and can leverage the macro view with price appreciation. The fund offers diversification benefits, helps to manage interest rate risk, and generates income under a wide range of interest rate environments.\n\nRISR invests primarily in interest-only mortgage-backed securities (MBS IOs) and U.S. Treasury bonds. MBS IOs are a negative duration security that generally benefit from rising rates. MBS IOs\u2014and Treasuries to a lesser extent \u2014generally provide income under stable rates.\n\nFrom the fund\u2019s Investment Case document, the uncertainty in the yield curve leads to opportunities for this alternative investment strategy, which I find compelling:\n\nRISR Investment Case\n\nEven if short-term interest rates do fall, this ETF will still generate income from investments in AAA rated securities like Treasuries and MBS. The theory is that lower short-term rates could lead to mortgage buyers prepaying their loans to refinance at lower rates, thereby reducing the amount of interest received. However, in my opinion, that scenario is also likely to lead to increased demand for new mortgages as homebuyers who have been reluctant to take out new mortgages may consider doing so once rates do start to come down, somewhat offsetting that loss in interest payments.\n\nIn addition, the long US Treasury position could be increased as short-term rates decline, increasing the positive duration and helping to stabilize the income stream from those holdings. This strategy is further described in the Investment Case document.\n\nRISR Investment Case\n\nThis strategy is further described in detail in the Summary Prospectus for the fund:\n\nConversely, when interest rates are falling, the rate at which borrowers prepay or refinance their mortgages tends to increase. As a result, the income from MBS IOs may decline and the market value of MBS IOs may decrease, which will result in a decline in MBS IO valuations. The Fund\u2019s portfolio is structured such that a potential decline in MBS IO valuations may be partially offset by gains in the Fund\u2019s U.S. Treasury positions, which have a positive duration, as discussed further below. In this scenario, the Fund\u2019s portfolio will likely be rebalanced to bring the overall duration in line with the Duration Target Range, which will generally involve selling the U.S. Treasury positions and increasing the Fund\u2019s holdings of MBS IOs. It should be noted, however, that in the case of MBS IOs, a default by an underlying borrower, will have the same effect as a voluntary prepayment (i.e., it will reduce the balance of the underlying mortgage pool, thereby reducing the market value of the MBS IO, notwithstanding such guarantee).\n\nHow Does AI Help?\n\nThe fund sponsor behind RISR is called FolioBeyond, LLC. They are a registered investment adviser that was established in 2017. They call themselves a \u201cQuantamental\u201d investor because they combine quantitative and fundamental analysis with a machine learning, artificial intelligence approach to implement the strategy described above. According to the fund\u2019s Investment Pitchbook, the solutions offered include \u201cadvanced proprietary algorithms for portfolio construction, asset allocation rebalancing, and stress testing.\u201d\n\nThe investment process is diagrammatically outlined in that same Pitchbook document and shows a top-down asset allocation approach followed by a bottom-up security selection process.\n\nRISR Investment Pitchbook\n\nMonthly High Yield Income from AAA Rated Securities\n\nAlthough the price performance of the fund since inception is very impressive, the steady monthly income that RISR offers is one of the most attractive aspects for me. According to the fund website, the monthly dividend for the past 2 years has amounted to $0.18 per share and a special dividend of $0.5130 was paid in December 2023.\n\nfund website\n\nFund Performance and Comparison to Other AAA rated ETFs\n\nAlthough the RISR ETF has only been in existence for less than 3 years, its performance has been impressive in that time. According to the fund website, total return since inception has exceeded 60% and represents an average annual yield of nearly 20%.\n\nfund website\n\nWhen comparing RISR to other AAA rated funds that offer similar yields of 6% to 7% such as JAAA or CLOA, the difference in performance due to capital appreciation in RISR since its inception is quite remarkable.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nAnd when comparing RISR to a plain vanilla investment grade bond fund such as the Fidelity Investment Grade Bond ETF (FIGB), the relative outperformance just in the past year is still very impressive.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nIn fact, the SA Quant ratings indicate that RISR is #1 out of 15 in the nontraditional Bond sub-class and #2 out of 444 in the Taxable Bond asset class. The gross expense ratio of 1.13% is the only negative factor, and even that is not terrible for an actively managed ETF that offers a 7.2% dividend yield.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nSummary: Buy RISR for Monthly Income and a Portfolio Hedge Against High Interest Rates\n\nAs an income investor now in retirement, I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to collect a high yield income stream, preferably paid on a monthly basis, that has some potential for capital appreciation (or at least avoids loss of capital invested over time). This relatively new ETF from FolioBeyond (using Tidal Investments as fund adviser) checks all those boxes for me and might be of interest to others who are looking for a similar investment. The fund is relatively small with about $61M in AUM and is subject to a number of risks that potential investors should be aware of, including the potential to drop in price once interest rates do get cut.\n\nIf you believe like I do that interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer as talks of reductions keep getting pushed farther out, it may be worth buying some shares of RISR now for the monthly income and for some protection in the fixed income portion of your portfolio. With a yield exceeding 7% annually from relatively low risk AAA-rated holdings such as US Treasuries and MBS securities, RISR offers a compelling alternative fixed income investment opportunity.",

        "title": "The MaM Portfolio: 2024 Q2 Update",
        "body": "tadamichi\n\nWelcome to Moats and Monopolies! We do things a little differently here. We not only transparently share our complete portfolio holdings each and every quarter for you to learn along with us, but we write exclusively about companies that we own and therefore have a deeper understanding of. If you are interested in catching up with our investment journey since we started to share on Seeking Alpha one full year ago, you can find links below!\n\nQ2 2023 In this initial share, we discuss our professional background and reasons for sharing publicly the portfolio. Q3 2023 In this update, we go into more detail regarding our investment philosophy, and the portfolio (as well as our pen name) was changed to Moats and Monopolies. FY 2023 In this full-year review, we benchmark ourselves directly against the S&P 500 (spoiler, we beat the market...) as well as ruminate and reflect upon what we've learned this year. Q1 2024 In this update, the MaM beat portfolio each of the three indices against which we benchmark our performance (S&P 500, Nasdaq and MSCI World), and we discussed why we decided to sell fully out of ETFs held to focus on our core holdings. Click to enlarge\n\nInvestment Philosophy in 100 Words\n\nWe are long-only and invest in some of the highest quality companies from around the world. We look for businesses that can compound their revenues over time - ideally with high margins. We prefer companies with low capital expenditures and low debt levels. We look for companies with defensible moats and love to see companies with sustainable, monopolistic parts to their businesses. We have no problem paying for quality and believe that the key isn't valuation but patience - we expect to beat the market by buying better-than-average companies and holding them for longer-than-average periods of time.\n\nChanges\n\nInitiated Buys: None Added: (purchased price) Bitcoin (As part of monthly 'savings plan') MSCI ($442.78) Meta Platforms ($421.16 & $474.40) Linde ($419.56 & $426.35) Pool Corp ($364.97 & $312.60) Broadcom ($1318 - pre-split price) Salesforce ($278.06 & $216.30) Costco ($762.37) Intuitive Surgical ($380.38) Taiwan Semiconductor ($142.97) MercardoLibre ($1713.52) Microsoft ($410.78) ASML ($920.44) The Beauty Health Company ($2.00) Sold out of: (sale price) Adobe ($473.67) Starbucks ($72.56) Home Depot ($340.36) Canadian Pacific ($80.90) LVMH ($849.61) Trimmed: None Click to enlarge\n\nRationale\n\nFollowing Q1 2024, where we exited out of our ETF holdings to focus on individual stock picks, this quarter was about concentration - ensuring that our invested capital goes into the very best opportunities and our strongest convictions. As everyone on this platform is looking for Alpha, i.e., returns that beat the market, retail investors need to ensure that we have strategies that outperform the average returns of the indices against which we benchmark our returns - typically the S&P 500. In their excellent article 'Hidden Costs of Overdiversification: Understanding using Research on Mutual Funds', Wright Research presented an argument that makes a lot of common sense - the more stocks one owns, the more likely their return is to match the market. Further, in one of the books that has most influenced our investment philosophy: 'Concentrated Investing', Allen C Benello explored the outperformance of fund managers and investors who bucked the commonly held trend of diversification - i.e., not to have one's eggs all in one basket, and instead selected a small number of long-term winners and investing heavily into them.\n\nThe most famous example of which is, of course, Warren Buffett who has at most recent check over half of Berkshire's asset portfolio invested in just one company: Apple. We are also big fans of Chris Hohn who runs the Children's Investment Fund and at the time of writing has nearly $40 billion of assets under management into just 10 positions.\n\nGoing back to Benello's book. One line of inquiry took him to take random samples of companies from the S&P 500 and then back test portfolio returns assuming each had been equal weighted and held for a duration of 16 years. He found that the best returns (and conversely the lowest) were most likely when investors concentrated into a few holdings. To summarise the findings: The more stocks one owns, the less likely they are to hold a company that suffers existential threat, but conversely the higher the chance that they hold positions that underperform the market. The fewer stocks held, the inverse - the threat of a stock going to zero becomes a bigger risk as a percentage of a portfolio, but there are fewer positions that could potentially underperform.\n\nAs a crude analogy, think about a trip to the casino. The biggest winner or loser in the building will be that guy whose rock up to the roulette table and goes all in on black on the 1st spin. Either doubling his money or losing everything. On the other extreme, there will be those who bring their money and drip it slowly across a variety of games over the entire evening. They are much less likely to lose everything, but unlikely to go home with a life changing some of the money.\n\nConcentrated Investing: Strategies of the World's Greatest Concentrated Value Investors by Allen C. Benello (Published by Wiley & Sons)\n\nThe trick to this strategy is then to have a limited number of holdings, but crucially to ensure there is no existential risk by keeping close track of them. Further, as quality investors, we look for companies with strong competitive advantages, low levels of debt and consistent and compounding revenues. Our logic is that if we hold the best quality companies, no matter what the price, for long enough, they will outperform the average of the rest of those available on the public markets.\n\nHowever, the other side of this is the ability to rest well at nighttime without worrying about a large percentage of your net worth being in such a small number of holdings. There is always a sweet spot on the investment risk/reward spectrum at which we all feel at ease, and for the MaM portfolio, that sweet spot is 20 holdings, yours may be different - and that's absolutely fine! For us, around 5% in a particular holding feels enough of a weighting of invested capital. Should a particular company outperform others in the portfolio and grow to a much larger position than 5%, then our philosophy is to let it run - the old adage 'trim the weeds, water the flowers' is a simple mantra to which we adhere.\n\nWith that in mind, we used a series of quantitative and qualitative calculations and created a 'league table' of our convictions with scores for each of our holdings. We had already decided to 'relegate' or sell completely out of any companies to get us down to our target of 20 holdings, and then created target weightings accordingly. That led to us selling out of Starbucks (SBUX), The Home Depot (HD), LVMH (OTCPK:LVMHF) and Canadian Pacific (CP). Starbucks was particularly painful, as we had just bought it before the disastrous earnings report that led it to slide 15%. Note the smaller position in Beauty Health Company (SKIN) is not included as it is much more speculative than the rest of our holdings, and we have a clear target price at which we would sell out of the holding, whilst the others in the portfolio are hopefully going to be held for years to come. The table can be seen below:\n\nThe MaM Portfolio holdings with target allocations and scores for 'conviction' (Author's own work)\n\nAdobe (ADBE) was sold at a price of $473.67, following concerns mentioned in our most recent portfolio update, in which we explained how as we buy expensive companies that will grow into their valuations, we need to be confident about their competitive advantages (i.e. their moat or their monopoly) in order to be sure that they can compound their value uninterrupted over a long enough period of time to rationalise the price we pay. We had concerns over Adobe, and it was unclear whether they would be victors or victims of AI, particularly with the ease with which one can generate images using new upstarts that have entered the market very recently. The stock has (naturally) raced up since we sold; however, we are fully aware of our inability to predict the future nor market time and feel comfortable that despite missing out on the ascent, funds have been reallocated effectively.\n\nThe rest of the changes reflect the natural rebalancing of reducing the portfolio holdings to 21 from 25, in addition to opportunistic purchases of MSCI, Pool Corp and Salesforce after post earnings/guidance dips.\n\nThe MaM Portfolio Holdings\n\nThe MaM Portfolio Holdings 2024 Q2 (Author's own work)\n\n8.44% Microsoft, 6.91% Alphabet, 5.78% Moody's, 5.44% Visa, 5.31% Meta Platforms, 5.01% MSCI Inc, 4.97% S&P Global, 4.92% Booking Holdings, 4.84% Amazon, 4.75% MercadoLibre, 4.60% Intuitive Surgical, 4.58% Mastercard, 4.32% Taiwan Semiconductor, 4.27% Salesforce, 4.25% ASML, 4.22% Costco, 4.01% Linde, 3.97% Broadcom, 2.81% Games Workshop, 2.55% Pool Corp and 1.17% The Beauty Health Company.\n\nThe MaM Portfolio Statistics:\n\nNumber of Stocks 21\n\nNumber of Total Holdings 23\n\nMedian Market Cap (billions) \u20ac224,321\n\nMedian Age of Companies Held 37 years\n\nWeighted Gross Profit Margin 81.39%\n\nWeighted Levered FCF Margin 29.82%\n\nWeighted ROIC 28.03%\n\nWeighted WACC 13.93%\n\nWeighted ROCE 47.88%\n\nPE on Price 35.06\n\nFCF Yield on Price 3.66%\n\n10 Year Revenue Growth 19.97%\n\n10 Year FCF Growth 26.84%\n\n10 Year Dividend Growth* 11.77%\n\n*Only applies to companies that have paid out a consistent dividend for 10 years or more\n\nAuthor's own work Author's own work Author's own work Author's own work\n\nIn these charts, we can see the impact of selling out of some lower margin businesses, such as Starbucks and Home Depot, has had on the overall weighted margins of the MaM portfolio. We hold many companies that have extraordinarily high gross margins due to their asset-light business models, such as the payment processors, software companies and credit agencies. Our current weighted free cash flow margin is hovering around 30%, showing the high quality and profitability of our holdings.\n\nThe weighted cost of capital is still creeping higher, and we read this as a further lagging indicator of the trickle-down effects of inflation and interest rate increases on our holdings; however, the returns on that capital are increasing - particularly with those companies that have recently undertaken large acquisitions: S&P Global (SPGI), Moody's (MCO) and Linde (LIN). Further, the improved profitability of our ecommerce companies Amazon (AMZN) and MercardoLibre (MELI) have contributed well this quarter.\n\nWe can also see that despite the portfolio's very high valuation, the weighted PE is coming down as the free cash flow yield on cost increases. Our growth model suggests that the weighted PE will drop to 15 by 2030 and the FCF yield should hit 10% a decade out from here. This may still sound very expensive to many of you (and that's completely OK!); however, as you can see from our final chart, we are paying for the fast growth of the companies we hold and the growing market opportunities that are available to them. We are investing in what we see as important macro trends for the near future: ecommerce, robotic surgical assistants, cloud infrastructure, semiconductor makers and designers, software companies and digital payment processors in the continuous 'war against cash'. Further, we also hold what we consider to be dependable companies that will be difficult to innovate away such as Linde, (industrial gases), Pool Corp (swimming pool distributors/retailers) and Costco (basic staples). We are confident that we have picked winners that can continue to grow relatively unchallenged, and thus will grow into their lofty valuations. Time will tell, of course.\n\nBenchmarking\n\nHow $10k would have grown since beginning our portfolio share on Seeking Alpha vs major indices (Author's own work)\n\nWhilst most of you reading this article will benchmark your performance against the S&P 500, we choose to use three indices - the MSCI World (our portfolio is around 1/5 international stocks), the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, due to our high exposure to technology stocks. The line graph above shows what would have happened had one invested $10k into the MaM portfolio as well as the aforementioned indices at the time at which we began to share our holdings. As you can see, we have been comfortably beating the market so far; however, the timescale is so small as to make it quite insignificant - we are overweight technology, and we may well be experiencing a little AI overexcitement in valuations at the moment, leading our portfolio and the Nasdaq to race ahead of an already bullish market over the past handful of quarters.\n\nWe have decided to start to show how each of our holdings is doing on a quarterly basis as well as how our portfolio and benchmark indices are performing, and an addition to our regular portfolio updates. Please note that all of the calculations, charts and tables throughout the article are methodically done by hand using Google Sheets, Seeking Alpha, Guru Focus and where necessary company 10Ks and 10Qs or international equivalent where we have data missing. Further, it is part way through the 28th June as we write this, so the data doesn't include the 2nd half of today's trading. So please take each of these numbers with a grain of salt, but it gives us a reference point for contributors and detractors for our portfolio. Finally, they are based purely on the difference in stock prices between points around about the end of each quarter. Finally, we may have added to positions during a quarter at a variety of cost prices, so our returns on individual holdings may not match what is below.\n\n2024 Q2 performances of individual MaM holdings, overall portfolio as well as benchmarks. (Author's own work)\n\nFinal Words\n\nThank you, as always, for those of you who follow the Moats and Monopolies portfolio. We do not intend to make any major additions or changes in the upcoming couple of quarters, but hope to be able to use some extra summer vacation time to finally get back to writing articles again (there's a toddler in the house, which takes time away from the keyboard.) On the mind at the moment is a write-up on Pool Corp, so look out for that soon!\n\nLooking forward to discussing both our portfolio and investing in general below the line.

        "title": "Micron: The Stock Trading At 14.7x P/E In 2025 Is A Buy (MU)",
        "body": "da-kuk/E+ via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nMicron's (NASDAQ:MU) stock triggered a 7% pullback despite a better-than-expected Q3 FY2024 earnings result. Its Q4 FY2024 guidance also topped the market consensus. Given the strong rally this year, the post-earnings selloff might be driven by consolidation or concern about a significant increase in capex impacting its FCF in FY2025. Nevertheless, MU's top-line growth trajectory has significantly reaccelerated since early this year, driven by price hikes and strong demand for high-margin AI-related products, including High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), high-capacity DIMMs, and data center SSDs.\n\nIn my previous article, I issued a sell rating, due to a 50% revenue decline amid premium valuation. However, over the past 12 months, there has been a tremendous shift in the growth story for NAND and DRAM. Due to the stock pullback, I upgraded MU to a buy, as the stock is now trading at 14.7x non-GAAP P/E FY2025 based on Bloomberg EPS consensus.\n\n3Q FY2024 Takeaway\n\nThe company model\n\nMU beat revenue estimates in Q3 FY2024, largely driven by 50% QoQ growth in its Storage Business Unit. However, investors might be disappointed that its Q4 FY2024 revenue guidance was only 0.26% above the estimate. Let's look at the chart above. Despite a nearly 50% YoY revenue decline in FY2023, the company's top-line growth has significantly reaccelerated since Q1 FY2024, accelerating over the past four quarters.\n\nThe midpoint of the Q4 FY2024 revenue guidance implies an 89.5% YoY growth, which is even higher than the previous quarter. I believe that the significant growth rebound justifies the recent price action and multiple expansions for the stock. Given the strong growth momentum, it's possible that this selloff might imply that buyside consensus is even higher, and the muted 4Q revenue outlook might disappoint some investors as well. However, it's clear that MU's future growth trajectory will trend significantly higher due to AI-driven opportunities.\n\nThe company model\n\nNow let's look at the company's margins. We can see that MU has significantly improved its gross margin, which is another positive signal. Typically, in the early stages, a growth company will prioritize top-line growth to maintain market share at the expense of margin expansion. While its non-GAAP gross margin is still below the 40% threshold that we've seen back in FY2022, it's encouraging to see that a guided 34.5% non-GAAP gross margin in 4Q FY2024. I believe the gross margin will continue to expand towards previous highs in FY2025 due to price hikes on AI-related products.\n\nWith an expected 60.5% YoY revenue growth in FY2024 and significant margin expansion, we expect a massive rebound in earnings growth. The company not only beat non-GAAP EPS in Q3 FY2024 but also topped market consensus for Q4 FY2024. It's also a positive sign that its non-GAAP EPS is in positive territory and poised to trend significantly higher in the coming quarters.\n\nWall Street Is Bullish on MU's Growth Outlook\n\nAlthough the management did not provide a FY2025 outlook, the street has significantly boosted its revenue and earnings revisions over the past few months. In the earnings call, the management indicated that the AI boom would drive significant growth in the demand for DRAM and NAND. They highlighted that the HBM3E solution boasts 30% lower power consumption than peers. Additionally, they also mentioned that HBM is sold out for 2024 and 2025, which will generate multiple billions of dollars in revenue in FY2025, up from several hundred million dollars in FY2024. With volume and pricing locked in for the next year, the street is bullish on the company's growth outlook. Currently, sell-side analysts on Bloomberg expect average growth in its non-GAAP EPS for FY2025 to reach $9.04 per share, implying a 672.6% YoY growth. While the stock is currently trading at a lofty P/E TTM, I believe its P/E forward will significantly come down and look attractive if we factor in its FY2025 earnings consensus.\n\nGrowing Capex Will Impact FCF\n\nThe management indicates that MU's FY2024 capex plan will be around $8 billion. We can estimate that Q4 FY2024 capex will be $2.7 billion, an 87% YoY boost compared to Q4 FY2023. Q4 capex is expected to be 36% of total revenue, up from 30.6% in Q3 FY2024. Management also expects to increase capex materially in FY2025, with capex around the mid-30% range of revenue. In the earnings call, they indicated that this would support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction, and technology transition investment to maintain demand growth. However, I believe the post-earnings selloff is partially driven by this announcement, as it will significantly impact FCF in the near term.\n\nValuation\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nAs I mentioned in my last analysis, the stock was approaching an all-time high EV/Sales TTM back in June 2023, even as its revenue suffered from a 50% YoY decline. However, I mentioned that \"when the stock price decreases, the valuation multiple becomes more expensive.\" But we can expect MU's growth outlook to be significantly higher in FY2025.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nDespite an 88.3% expansion in its multiple from 4x in my previous coverage to 7.53x now, its EV/Sales FY2025E is expected to decrease to 4.26x, according to Seeking Alpha's FY2025 revenue growth estimate of 50.75% YoY. Therefore, the stock is not trading at a lofty valuation.\n\nIn addition, if we factor in the Q4 FY2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.08, we can estimate the stock's P/E FY2024 to be 113x, which is incredibly high. However, the company is expected to generate 672.6% YoY non-GAAP EPS growth in FY2025. This will make its non-GAAP P/E FY2025 to be 14.7x, significantly below the S&P 500's P/E FY2025 of 19.6x. Therefore, I believe MU is currently undervalued and still has room for further upside. The last week's selloff created a buying opportunity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, MU's strong Q3 FY2024 earnings result, driven by substantial demand for NAND and DRAM and better-than-expected guidance for Q4, highlights its resilience and massive growth potential amidst the current AI boom. Despite a recent 7% stock pullback, likely due to consolidation and increased capex impacting near-term FCF, the company's significant revenue and margin expansions signal a growth rebound story in the long run, which deserves a higher valuation. With non-GAAP EPS back in positive territory and expected to jump nearly sevenfold in FY2025, MU's non-GAAP P/E FY2025 appears extremely undervalued and poised for further upside. Therefore, I upgraded the stock to buy.",

        "title": "Kinsale Capital (KNSL): An Excess And Surplus Insurer For Excess And Surplus Profits",
        "body": "The best photo for all\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the last time I reviewed Kinsale Capital, shares of the company have fallen over 22%. I felt that Kinsale had a strong growth trajectory in the excess & surplus insurance market and a strong competitive advantage in providing faster quotes with technology-enabled processes. In this article, I\u2019ll provide an update to my original investment thesis, dissect the latest quarterly results, and share my thoughts on the outlook and valuation.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nKinsale Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:KNSL) is a specialty insurance company. What makes Kinsale unique is that it exclusively targets the excess and surplus (E&S) market, which is the fastest part of the insurance market. Based out of Virginia, Kinsale was founded in 2009 by the current Chairman and CEO, Michael Kehoe, who had previously served as the President and CEO of James River Group Holdings (JRVR). Specializing in hard-to-place commercial property & casualty insurance for small- to -medium-sized businesses, a significant portion of Kinsale\u2019s business is in commercial lines, including Commercial Property, Excess Casualty, and Small Business Casualty.\n\nInvestor Presentation\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nPositioned as a leader in the E&S market, I think Kinsale is poised to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds. As a market that\u2019s often underserved by traditional insurance, E&S continues to get a large inflow of business from standard companies and rate driven by inflation and relatively tight underwriting conditions. Among the subsegments of the insurance industry, E&S is relatively exciting because it\u2019s still in its early stages. Growth at Kinsale will continue to benefit from more underwriting in the E&S market as a whole, but Kinsale in particular will benefit given its tech-driven service and product expansion. With faster turnaround times relative to peers and 14 new underwriting divisions in recent years (bringing Kinsale to 25 divisions today) Kinsale should continue to maintain its market leading position.\n\nI think Kinsale\u2019s industry-leading underwriting performance is likely to continue. As I\u2019ll discuss later, the company has some of the best returns on equity and combined ratios for insurance. I think strong results like the recent results are replicable going forward, and the company\u2019s favorable reserve development reflects diligence on general liability. There\u2019re very few insurance companies who are able to do what Kinsale has done. The only insurance companies to my knowledge that have better combined ratios are AMERISAFE (AMSF) and International General Insurance (IGIC), a company I previously covered in February.\n\nInvestor Presentation\n\nFinally, Kinsale\u2019s focus and technological advantage are a source of moat. Kinsale\u2019s expense ratio is very low (at 20.8% in 2023, according to S&P Capital IQ), which is supported by a centralized structure and proprietary technology. In an interview with Ron Baron, Kinsale discussed how its IT systems are built in-house, eliminating constraints on adding new product lines or features that reduce labor for underwriters. For most new business submissions, this helps Kinsale to swiftly issue quotes where fast turnaround times and responsiveness builds goodwill with brokers and allows KNSL to pay lower commissions, as brokers are willing to trade commissions for service and specialization in hard-to-place risks. It also means that Kinsale can charge a small premium because it underwrites faster.\n\nInvestor Presentation\n\nOperating in a rapidly growing segment of the insurance market, Kinsale has been benefitting from strong tailwinds. Over the last ten years, the company has produced a 38.1% CAGR on the top line and 40.7% on the bottom line (EBITDA). In the last five years, the company has shown no signs of slowing down, growing revenues and EBITDA at CAGRs of 40.7% and 57.4%, respectively (source: S&P Capital IQ).\n\nAuthor, based on data from S&P Capital IQ\n\nRecent Results\n\nWhen looking at the most recent results for Kinsale, the company reported earnings per share of $4.24, which was 76.7% higher than Q1\u201923. Gross written premiums increased by 25.5% to $448.6 million, and underwriting income was up 79.5%.\n\nOverall, these were very impressive results. Not only does Kinsale continue to put up strong top line growth, but the company\u2019s profitability has also rapidly improved.\n\nWe see that reflected in the company\u2019s combined ratio and ROE metrics too. At the end of the quarter, the company had combined ratio of 79.5%, and it posted an operating return on equity of 28.9%. On the expense ratio, the company saw a decline from 21.7% last year to 20.7% this quarter. Most of this was driven by the benefit of higher ceding commissions from the Company's casualty and commercial property proportional reinsurance agreements as a result of growth in the lines of business ceded into those treaties. This is sustainable, in my view, given that brokers are willing to trade commissions for volume for business with Kinsale.\n\nCompany Filings\n\nOn the earnings call, management noted that the growth in gross written premium of growth of 25.5% from 33.8% in the Q4\u201923 highlights a deceleration in growth rate from the 40% growth we've experienced over the last several years. This deceleration is mostly attributable by a return to a more normal level in competition.\n\nIn P&C, property is an exciting area of growth for Kinsale because of its high growth rates and strong pricing. In casualty, challenges with respect to the frequency and severity of inflation, rising loss cost, and an unpredictable legal system make for a market that provides Kinsale a long-term growth opportunity.\n\nIn terms of my outlook for Kinsale, I would continue to expect strong profitability ratios. Where I do see cause for concern is the deceleration in premium growth. As Kinsale gets larger and the market matures, I foresee premium growth settling towards a long-term run rate in the mid-teens. In the past, management has said that it believes that Kinsale can grow 10-20% through the cycle. Although I think that market conditions should eventually normalize, a potential uptick in casualty pricing (due to reserving issues facing by the industry) could prolong an already extended market and be beneficial for Kinsale.\n\nAnother element in Kinsale\u2019s financial profile to consider is how management will begin trading off growth and margins in a more normal market (i.e., more growth for lower margins resulting in higher underwriting income dollars) given the company\u2019s meaningful expense advantage (8-9 combined ratio points). In the current hard market, Kinsale has been somewhat of a price taker and has experienced both outsized growth and margins.\n\nValuation\n\nBased on the 10 sellside analysts covering the stock, there are 2 \u2018buy\u2019 ratings and 8 \u2018hold\u2019 ratings. From current price to the average price target of $418.38 one year out, this implies about 11.0% upside, not including the current dividend yield of 0.2%.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nKinsale trades for 25.6x P/E and 20.3x EV/EBITDA (source: S&P Capital IQ). While these might seem expensive on an absolute basis, keep in mind that Kinsale has been growing in excess of 20% on a compounded basis. For example, when using the forward multiples of 21.9x 2025 earnings and 18.4x 2026 earnings, the valuation seems much more reasonable when considering the company\u2019s future earnings growth, in spite of a deceleration.\n\nHistorically, management hasn't offered up guidance targets or growth forecasts. I find the 21.9x 2025 earnings and 18.4x 2026 earnings reasonable valuation multiples to use given the growth rate of the E&S market. According to a report from Allied Market Research, the E&S market is expected to grow at a rate of 15.2% from 2020 to 2027. This roughly in line with consensus revenue forecasts in 2025 and 2026 of 20.3% and 11.6%, so it seems that Kinsale should be able to grow with the industry (source: Bloomberg). This also helps to get over the current valuation multiple of 25.6x P/E, knowing that earnings are growing rapidly.\n\nCompared to its historical valuation, Kinsale is trading at one of the lowest valuations it's ever traded at. Historically, the company has traded at an average multiple of 30.3x EV/EBITDA. While the company may have been overpriced before, I think the recent pullback has given investors an opportunity to get long this compounder. At the current multiple of 20.3x, Kinsale offers up a strong discount to its ten-year average multiple, especially when we consider that this is a business that's essentially been doubling in size every 2 years.\n\nAuthor, based on data from S&P Capital IQ\n\nIn terms of the risks to the investment thesis, there are a few that investors should monitor, both macro and company specific. Firstly, there is a risk that the E&S market doesn't grow as fast as expected (15.2% per year). This could come from the general insurance market slowing down. During the pandemic, insurance companies had become \"essential businesses\" where insurance was needed for coverage of business interruption or incidents related to physical loss (e.g., forced closedown due to physical damage). I view the growth rate of E&S to be more secular rather than event-driven by the pandemic, particularly as Kinsale had been growing 20%+ even before 2019.\n\nSpecific to Kinsale, there's also a risk that new entrants into the market. For example, Kinsale enjoys a dominant market position in the E&S market and there's always a risk that new entrants put pressure on profitability ratios. If new competition goes head-to-head with Kinsale, the company would be forced to reduce premiums to remain competitive. While the company has superior technology, faster turnaround times, and a first-mover advantage as being the leader in the space, where there's money to be made, we can be sure that competition will eventually come to Kinsale. For now, I think the moat is very durable and even if the company can grow with the industry, the forward returns look quite attractive.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn this recent share price drop, I\u2019m adding to my position in Kinsale Capital. Over the company\u2019s relatively short life as a public company, Kinsale has grown from its founding in 2009 to a billion-dollar insurance company. Still, the company only has a 1% market share. With a track record of demonstrating remarkable business performance, I believe the share price decline has provided investors a gift to pick up shares of this compounder.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, Kinsale has clear competitive advantages that will make it a winner. With faster quotes compared to peers, a defensible moat with respect to its technology, and the ability to charge higher premiums, Kinsale is tapping into unmet needs in the E&S market. By focusing on smaller insurance premiums and diversifying risk across several industries, I think Kinsale offers up a compelling opportunity that offers elements of both growth and value. If the high multiple scares you, keep in mind that this business is doubling in size every couple of years. For investors who can get over this hurdle and can see a path to long-term growth, an investment in Kinsale makes sense.",

        "title": "Arm Holdings Has Significant Upside Potential With ARM Neoverse (NASDAQ:ARM)",
        "body": "BlackJack3D\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is reaching a major paradigm shift in their target market as the firm further develops their CSS architecture. ARM has recently made a few major announcements involving the adoption of their ARM Neoverse across the hyperscalers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Amazon (AMZN). As each of these firms further develop their high-performance processors to bolster the speed, reliability, and power reduction, I believe ARM will realize a significant growth opportunity that will take the firm well beyond their smartphone-entrenched market. I am upgrading my recommendation for ARM shares to a BUY rating with a price target of $213.78/share at 54.43x eFY26 price/sales.\n\nBe sure to review my previous coverage of Arm Holdings here:\n\nArm Will Have A Tough First Year Back In The Public Arena\n\nArm's Share Price Has Gotten Ahead Of Operating Growth\n\nARM Operations\n\nARM is positioning itself for significant growth in the coming years as \u201cAI everything\u201d starts to take form. Though I believe AI-enabled smartphones and AI-enabled PCs are going to experience a slow adoption in the next two years, CY24/CY25, I do anticipate adoption to begin taking hold as consumers begin upgrading and migrating to the latest devices. To make my thesis clear with respect to this theme, I do not anticipate consumers to upgrade their devices in mass for the sake of upgrading. I believe upgrades will be driven by the necessity to refresh hardware as opposed to seeking out the newest device. Despite my anticipation for a relatively flat consumer device market going into CY25, I do believe there is some value to be extracted within the segment as OEMs migrate from ARMv8 to ARMv9. As adoption accelerates to ARMv9, royalty revenue will follow as more CPUs fit inside the chip. This factor will drive significant value across both the top-line and bottom-line as these higher-powered chips will likely be very margin accretive. ARMv9 is expected to be utilized across multiple verticals, including automotive ADAS, handheld devices, and industrial IoT for enhanced automation, amongst others. Management expects ARMv9 adoption and CSS chips to start ramping up in e2h25.\n\nBright Spot For ARM Architecture\n\nThough I anticipate a relatively lackluster year for handheld devices, PCs, and automotive sales, there are some bright spots for ARM in the back-half of eFY25 and beyond. As discussed in my initial coverage of Nvidia, Nvidia Doesn't Need China For Growth In AI Chips, the hyperscalers were in the process of designing their own chipsets for AI factory purposes. These chips are beginning to come to fruition and are broadly adopting ARM architecture for its power efficiency, data retrieval, and integration. I believe this shift away from the x86 architecture into ARM architecture can drive significant growth beyond ARM\u2019s smartphone business in the coming years and will significantly shift the next generation of compute. Though this wasn\u2019t a part of my core thesis for Intel (INTC), a shift to ARM architecture may create a major headwind for their x86 business.\n\nOne point that stuck out to me in the q4\u201924 earnings call was that management is seeking an avenue to enter into infrastructure and take some of the highly sought-after market share from the x86 server chip. On the call, management discussed how the ARM CPU and the NVIDIA (NVDA) GPU on the Grace Blackwell can integrate and allow for higher access to memory bandwidth when compared to the x86. This can be a major shift in server hardware if ARM architecture is utilized in the next generation of AI-enabled infrastructure and has the ability to bring ARM significant growth, if adopted. Though I believe this may be a long-shot expectation as this shift would be the biggest since the separation of hardware and software with the introduction of the x86, it can very well occur as AI factories are somewhat more standalone vs. traditional general compute server farms. I personally wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on this shift to occur; however, if ARM CPUs are adopted in server hardware, I expect this to first occur across hyperscalers before going into enterprise data centers.\n\nARM announced their partnership with Microsoft in November 2023 to develop the Neoverse CSS that can create more custom, specialized solutions for AI infrastructure and networking devices. Management mentioned in the q4\u201924 earnings call that their first Neoverse/Microsoft (MSFT) Cobalt chip is now ramping up. This is likely to bleed into Oracle\u2019s (ORCL) AI factories being built out as the firm seeks to take on market share. Oracle is currently working on accelerating the ARM developer ecosystem to transition applications from x86 to ARM architecture. As management at ARM described the CPU+GPU model with Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell, Oracle will likely be leveraging this model to accelerate AI and HPC applications.\n\nARM also announced their partnership with Google (GOOGL, GOOG) for their Axion processor. Google announced that the Axion Processors will be available for GCP customers in late CY24 and will provide faster data retrieval, faster video distribution, and GenAI. These chips will provide for better energy efficiency across Google\u2019s AI factories. Google expects 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instance with up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency when compared to the current generation x86-based instance.\n\nARM Financials\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nForecasting financials for ARM, I anticipate the firm to begin realizing tailwinds in growth and margin expansion in e2h25 and into eFY26. Given the early ramp of the ARM Neoverse, I do not expect this form factor to be accretive to growth until eFY26, as the ramp up with Microsoft isn\u2019t likely to occur until eFY2h25. I believe this will be the catalyst that will drive ARM to the next level of growth and profitability. In the meantime, I anticipate a relatively flat outcome as a result of the soft smartphone and automotive market, net of new adoption in automotive ADAS.\n\nValuation & Shareholder Value\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nOne of the biggest challenges ARM faces is their valuation. Shares are currently trading at 53x price/sales, a relatively high valuation for the industry. As a value investor, I believe this premium makes the shares un-investable as shares are priced for perfection.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nAs a growth investor, I believe ARM shares will realize significant upside given the adoption of ARM Neoverse across the hyperscalers. To add some perspective, Oracle is constructing massive 200MW AI factories and a 1GW AI factory. Given the relationship with ARM, I believe that Oracle will likely utilize ARM CPUs paired with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to accelerate performance.\n\nCorporate Reports\n\nGiven these growth factors, I am upgrading my recommendation for ARM to a BUY rating with a price target of $213.78/share at 54.43x eFY26 price/sales.\n\nAdditional Risks to Consider\n\nThere are some risks to take into consideration as we navigate through my investment thesis. To state the obvious first, ARM currently has a very rich valuation, and any minor setbacks can result in a significant decline in the share price. Another risk to consider is that Neoverse may not be as broadly adopted as laid out in my thesis, as this would require significant software upgrades to migrate from the x86 to ARM architecture. In addition to this risk, my expectation is for Neoverse to begin impacting the top-line towards the end of eFY25 and more prominently in eFY26. ARM will likely need to bridge the growth gap with stronger handheld sales in order to maintain their premium valuation before Neoverse ramps up. Any one of these events may lead to my gray-sky scenario and send shares down -34%.",

        "title": "Portillo's: Buying The Beef And The Stock (NASDAQ:PTLO)",
        "body": "bhofack2\n\nPortillo's (NASDAQ:PTLO) shares have fallen 40% year-to-date and are now off 55% over the past year. Investors have fled the stock following a disappointing first quarter earnings report, concern over consumer spending, and persistent selling by private equity firm Berkshire Partners (not affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway) since the IPO.\n\nWhile 1Q numbers weren't great, at today's price, I see little fundamental downside in Portillo's shares (discussed below) and think investors are overlooking some important positives, notably:\n\nLoyal core customer base in Chicagoland which provides some competitive insulation should price competition increase\n\nOperational improvements from kitchen reconfiguration & opportunities to reduce front of store costs through kiosks\n\nContinued restaurant expansion opportunity in sunbelt markets - new restaurant footprints have been optimized to improve returns on capital\n\nApproaching end of private equity overhang as Berkshire Partners is now down below 20% ownership (versus 60+% at IPO).\n\nWhile I was negative on Portillo's in late 2022 (with the stock at 20) and neutral earlier this year at 14, below $10 per share I am a buyer of the stock (and the delicious Italian beef sandwiches). I see the potential for 60% near-term upside and 130% upside (32% annualized) looking out to 2027.\n\nRecent Results & Near-term Outlook\n\nPortillo's 1Q24 Same-Store Sales (Investor Presentation)\n\nAs shown above, same-restaurant sales in 1Q24 were slightly negative as positive pricing was more than offset by comparable transactions which declined 3.2% in the quarter. While results were disappointing it should be noted that Portillo's is not alone as several restaurant chains reported soft results their most recent quarter, including Starbucks (SBUX) which saw -7% traffic and -3% same-store sales and Wall Street darling Cava (CAVA) which had -1.2% traffic decline contributing to a softer than expected 2.3% same store revenue growth. Similarly, Darden's (DRI) largest chain Olive Garden also saw both negative comparable sales (-1.6%) and transactions (-2.6%). Nearly all restaurants are facing pressure as consumers tighten their belts due to years of inflationary pressure constraining household budgets and we are likely to see continued softness in near-term results.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, Portillo's will be at a bit of a disadvantage versus restaurant peers when it comes to transaction/ same store comps because 55% of Portillo's locations (and 70% of revenue) are based in Illinois which has a declining population. Overall, I expect -1 to 0% same-store transaction growth for the next couple of years (and 0-3% same-store revenue growth) until more sunbelt locations enter the comp base and bolster transactions.\n\nHaving said that, Portillo's has done a reasonable job managing profitability in a tough environment with restaurant level EBITDA margins declining just 0.4% year-over-year and overall EBITDA margins increasing. Moreover, as described below, there are operational improvement opportunities which should help preserve margins even in a tough environment for comps.\n\nOpportunities for improvement\n\nProduction Line Efficiency (2023 Investor Day Presentation)\n\nPortillo's has large restaurants, a broad menu, and a fair amount of operational complexity. Historically it has had an unnecessarily long 'production line' (100+ feet in some locations) which both increased capital and operating costs (lower unit throughput per employee) and slowed service. The company is not only addressing this with smaller and more efficient new store builds (47-65 foot production lines and $1 million reduction in capital costs) but is retrofitting many existing restaurants to improve efficiency and throughput.\n\nTrialing Ordering Kiosks (1Q24 earnings transcript from Seeking Alpha)\n\nI see the introduction of ordering kiosks as a notable potential positive for Portillo's. Benefits here are numerous and include: lower labor costs, improved order accuracy, and faster service time. The company is trialing kiosks in its California locations and I am hopeful that these will be rolled out to all locations over the next couple years.\n\nIt is also important to highlight that Portillo's has made significant improvements to the process by which it opens new restaurants. The company went through growth pains from 2015-2021 as it didn't have the infrastructure (dedicated new store opening teams) to properly open restaurants and had many hiccups along the way (incredibly long lines, poorly trained employees and in some cases 90 minute waits!). With scale Portillo's has been able to invest in new restaurant opening teams which has greatly improved the opening process and improved both customer and employee satisfaction.\n\nValuation\n\nAt $9.72 per share, after factoring in its debt, Portillo's has an enterprise value of just over $1 billion which is roughly the price at which Berkshire took it private in 2014 (when it had just 40 locations versus 86 today).\n\nPortillo's trades at just 10x 2024e EBITDA (and 9x 2025e EBITDA) which is a significant discount to other growing restaurant chains. While I consider the valuations of Cava (100x 2024e EBITDA and 80x 2025e EBITDA) and Kura Sushi (KRUS) at 60x 2024e EBITDA to be euphoric, Shake Shack (SHAK) which I consider to be the most comparable peer now trades for 21x 2024e EBITDA (and ~17.5x 2025e EBITDA).\n\nFinancial Targets (1Q24 Investor Presentation)\n\nHaving optimized restaurant formats and greatly improved the restaurant opening process, Portillo's has increased its unit growth targets. Moreover, as the company expands deeper into markets like Phoenix and Dallas, it well benefit from improved scale in advertising and logistics/distribution. While comps will be weighed down by its outsized Chicago footprint, I see management's target of low to mid teens EBITDA growth as achievable. As such, I see an EBITDA multiple of 13x as reasonable which suggests a 2025 fair value of $16 per share or 60% upside. Moreover, as Portillo's proves out its growth model, we could see the multiple expand to 15x (which would still be a large discount to the sector) which would imply a value of $23 (32% annualized) looking out to 2027.\n\nRisks\n\nAs mentioned above, consumers are tightening their belts when it comes to spending on restaurants and it is possible that this causes further deterioration in same store sales.\n\nPortillo's has net debt to EBITDA of 3x. While I believe this level of leverage is manageable, the balance sheet could become stretched if operating results underperform expectations.\n\nPortillo's is a small cap stock with a market capitalization below $800 million. Small cap stocks have significantly underperformed large caps over the past several years and it is possible that this trend may continue.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile sluggish consumer spending has dampened the near term outlook, I think the medium-term picture for Portillo's is fairly bright. With shares trading at a large discount to my estimate of fair value, I've taken a position in the stock.",

        "body": "Seeing some posts here about \"What's the next big thing?\" People talking about sexy bullshit use cases for AI. Self driving cars/trucks and whatever comes out of Musk's big head.\n\nI'm telling you, the next big AI/robotic movement isn't going to sexy or amazing. It's going to save companies a lot of money and be relatively low risk/low visibility. Just like the conversational AI with customer service and stuff like that.\n\nThe next big move is cleaning bots. There is a company called Bunzl, which probably nobody ever heard of but they trade in London and have an OTC symbol. They are, I think, either the largest or longest running cleaning supplies company in the world. I forget which. Maybe both. That stuff you see in public washrooms in office buildings, malls etc., they are the ones distributing it. They are currently working on a cleaning bot solution. People think of Rosey from the Jetsons. We aren't there yet. But cleaning bots are progressing and don't have the Skynet or general safety concerns of something like self-driving vehicles. Janitors also don't have the public sympathy or union support like truck drivers would. Usually just poor immigrants who can be done away with once they are no longer needed and no one will care.\n\nThink of cleaning bots kind of like zombie janitors. They have enough \"AI\" to perform their tasks, but not enough AI to actually be proactive in deciding which tasks to do and when. They need a centralized system run by someone to tell them what to do. That centralized system is being deployed as we speak. This is what is happening in Queen's University in Canada, one of the ground zero test cases:\n\nhttps://bunzlcanada.ca/queens-u-students-give-residence-cleaning-an-a/\n\nInstead of janitorial checkups at set times, a QR code system exists to ping the centralized system whenever cleanup or supplies are needed. If you read the article, you see early results have been positive. Eventually the software is going to be deployed all over the place, then the bots deployed to replace humans. It's going to happen in a blink of an eye. I think a good comparison will be self-checkout lanes in grocery stores. There was initially some pushback, but the pushback was so weak and short-lived that people just accept it as normal now.\n\nBunzl will benefit huge from this change, particularly since the perception is that they are some backwards old school company selling toilet paper. And haven't gone the way of Dunder Mifflin yet only because toilet paper can't be replaced by emails. This change in perception from shitty old school company into \"holy shit these guys were progressive after all\" is going to lift the stock. But they won't be the biggest percentage winners. The software isn't owned by Bunzl. It's owned by a penny stock in Canada (literally trading at 2 cents). I'm not going to mention the company but I will mention that I own 5 million shares and 5 million warrants in it. I am betting big that this thing is going to catch on fire once this cleaning bot program is out. You can PM me for the company name or Google \"Bunzl teams up with shitty penny stock company out of Canada\" and probably find the name easily enough if you care.",

Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins. Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction. I'm not exactly sure what I'm missing because I'm seeing such a good win/win scenario but wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts.",

Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they\u2019ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don\u2019t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.\n\nYes, Nvidia\u2019s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn\u2019t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.\n\nEvery time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn\u2019t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia\u2019s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn\u2019t happened and Nvidia\u2019s only gotten stronger.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say over time Nvidia won\u2019t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it\u2019s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.\n\nPlus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don\u2019t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.\n\nOverall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia\u2019s growth story.",

You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we\u2019re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.\n\nHow Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That\u2019s money that\u2019s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:\n\n$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)\n\n$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts\n\n$17,000 in savings bonds\n\n$43,000 in cash value life insurance\n\nIn terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.\n\nWhether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans\u2019 spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they\u2019re spending more to compensate for higher prices.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nHow Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?\n\nFinancial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don\u2019t match up.\n\nThe amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nDesired retirement lifestyle\n\nWhen they apply for Social Security benefits\n\nOther sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity\n\nOther savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs\n\nOverall health and life expectancy\n\nThe more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you\u2019ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees\u2019 income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.\n\nLong-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you\u2019ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you\u2019re not at risk of draining your savings.\n\nWhat Is a Good Net Worth at 70?\n\nhow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings\n\nNet worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it\u2019s the difference between what you own and what you owe.\n\nThe average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed\u2019s data.\n\nWhat constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that\u2019s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.\n\nIf you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.\n\nIs Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?\n\nWhether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it\u2019s helpful to consider:\n\nWhen you\u2019ll really need to take Social Security benefits\n\nWhether you\u2019ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring\n\nHow long you plan to live in retirement\n\nYour desired savings goal and current savings rate\n\nIf you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You\u2019ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.\n\nYou can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you\u2019re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.\n\nRetiring at 70 means you\u2019ll have a two-year gap before you\u2019ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You\u2019ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.\n\nWithin that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you\u2019re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you\u2019d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nhow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings\n\nHow much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that\u2019s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nConsider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don\u2019t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nDelaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/kupicoo, \u00a9iStock.com/AleksandarNakic, \u00a9iStock.com/jeffbergen\n\nThe post How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The euro advanced with European stock-index futures on speculation Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party will struggle to win an outright majority in French elections, easing investor concern that Europe\u2019s second-largest economy was headed for a more radical policy shift.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFutures on French government bonds edged higher, while CAC 40 Index futures jumped after the first round of voting showed Le Pen\u2019s National Rally in front of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance, albeit less comfortably than some polls projected. A very strong showing for her party would have increased the odds of expansive fiscal policy in France, whose deficit already exceeds what\u2019s allowed under European Union rules.\n\nAsian shares gained, with South Korea\u2019s benchmark gaining alongside Japan\u2019s Topix. China\u2019s 10-year bond yield fell to a record amid pessimism about the domestic economy.\n\nThere is a sense of relief \u201cthat the far-right parties did not get the kind of majority that was feared,\u201d Charu Chanana, a market strategist for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s David Ingles and Stephen Engle.\n\nIn addition to French politics, investors will be looking to the European Central Bank for clues, she said, adding \u201cthere\u2019s been some sense of stability for the euro zone economy after that first rate cut, but we certainly don\u2019t look like we\u2019re out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s second round of voting will be held on July 7. The French political world is now embarking on a period of horse-trading. In constituencies where three people qualified for the runoffs, the third-placed candidate can withdraw to boost the chances of another mainstream party defeating the far right.\n\nJapan\u2019s Tankan\n\nWhile central banks in Europe have begun easing policy, the door was left open to an interest-rate increase in Japan later this month after data on Monday showed that confidence among Japan\u2019s large manufacturers rose. The yield on the nation\u2019s 10-year bond rose one basis point to 1.06%.\n\nOne in three economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicts a rate hike at the Bank of Japan\u2019s next gathering. The yen dropped to the lowest level since 1986 last week, prompting some analysts to flag a heightened risk of a rate move as Governor Kazuo Ueda has pledged to watch the yen\u2019s impact on inflation closely.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn corporate news, Boeing Co. agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 a share in an all-stock deal that values the supplier at $4.7 billion, unwinding a two-decade separation as the embattled US plane-maker tries to fix is manufacturing defects. The US Justice Department will charge the company with criminal fraud, leaving the firm to choose between pleading guilty or taking the risk of going to trial, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA swath of data indicated the US biggest economy is cooling without lasting damage to consumers. US consumer sentiment declined by less than initially estimated on expectations inflationary pressures will moderate and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge marked its smallest advance in six months. Treasury 10-year notes were little changed on Monday.\n\n\u201cGoing into the second half, there\u2019s a lot of election election uncertainty and we think the dollar will be the best risk-off hedge,\u201d Alex Loo, foreign exchange and macro strategist at TD Securities, told Annabelle Droulers and Shery Ahn on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe do like its appeal as a safe-haven currency.\u201d\n\nIn commodities, oil edged higher as traders weighed China\u2019s economic outlook and geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East.

        "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted Nvidia to new heights. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has soared 27,310% in the past 10 years, making it one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nBut there's a much smaller business that has performed even better. I'm talking about Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH). This beverage stock has skyrocketed 27,360% in the past decade (as of June 25), turning a $10,000 investment into a jaw-dropping $2.7 million.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Celsius' meteoric rise to becoming a $13-billion business today. Then by viewing things with a fresh perspective, investors can assess if the stock is a smart buying opportunity.\n\nEnergizing growth\n\nIf you see a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Celsius has, it's worth taking the time to figure out what factors led to such a strong performance. In this case, it shouldn't be a surprise that the key driver of Celsius' ascent has been incredible sales growth.\n\nBehind only Red Bull and Monster Beverage, the business has become the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. In 2023, Celsius reported revenue of $1.3 billion. That figure was 102% higher than the year before. And it represented an impressive 25-fold increase from only five years ago.\n\nWhile the broader non-alcoholic beverage industry might be extremely mature, the energy drink category is registering faster growth. Perhaps consumers aren't interested in drinking sugary beverages as much as they were 10 or 20 years ago. Or maybe there's simply a heightened focus on drinks that are supposedly healthier for you.\n\nThis is what Celsius aims to be. By marketing its products as functional beverages that have certain health benefits, it has steadily gained consumer mindshare. Any consumer-facing brand should strive to do just this.\n\nCelsius has also benefited from getting its drinks in front of more customers. This means expanding its presence in various retail settings. The business is also finding tremendous success on Amazon, an extremely popular e-commerce site that gets billions of visitors each month.\n\nAnd with the help of PepsiCo, which is Celsius' distribution partner both domestically and abroad, this company is in a favorable position to keep finding success.\n\nIs it too late to buy Celsius stock?\n\nSince hitting their all-time high in March of this year, Celsius shares have been nosediving, tanking 42% in less than five weeks. On May 28, Dara Mohsenian, a research analyst at Morgan Stanley, published a note that said the company's sales fell sequentially during the week ending May 18, causing Celsius' market share to dip slightly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even after its monumental decline, I still believe Celsius is an overvalued stock. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 61.6. That's a steep valuation to pay, particularly as sales are slowing down. And I think it gives prospective investors zero margin of safety.\n\nCelsius is expected to increase revenue at an annualized clip of 31% between 2023 and 2026. This is a far cry from the triple-digit growth investors have probably become accustomed to.\n\nWhat also worries me is that these projections could prove to be overly optimistic. Celsius has likely already taken advantage of the so-called low-hanging-fruit opportunity with its Pepsi deal. Moreover, the industry has virtually no barriers to entry. There's nothing stopping a well-funded entrepreneur from starting his or her own energy drink business, which consumers could flock to.\n\nCelsius has undoubtedly been a fantastic investment in the past decade, turning a small sum into nearly $3 million. But the stock doesn't look like a smart buying opportunity today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Boeing to Buy Spirit Aero for $4.7 Billion in Stock Deal",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 a share in an all-stock deal that values the supplier at $4.7 billion, unwinding a two-decade separation as the embattled US planemaker tries to fix is manufacturing defects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe total transaction value is about $8.3 billion, including Spirit\u2019s last reported net debt, according to a statement early on Monday. Rival Airbus SE will also take over parts of Spirit that make parts for its operations, and the European planemaker will pay a nominal price of $1 for the assets, while receiving $559 million in compensation, according to a separate release.\n\n\u201cWe believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,\u201d Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said in the statement.\n\nThe complex, three-way transaction reunites Boeing with an operation that it spun off in 2005 as part of a broader push to trim costs and outsource assets. The move to take Spirit back in-house came in the wake of the near catastrophic accident on Jan. 5 in which a fuselage that had been assembled by Spirit lost a door-shaped panel during flight. That mishap triggered a chain reaction at Boeing, which has seen a wholesale management shakeup, federal investigations, to scrutiny of to federal investigations.\n\nThe price that Boeing is paying is 30% above Spirit\u2019s closing stock price on February 29, the day before the companies confirmed they were in merger talks.\n\nAirbus said it entered a \u201cbinding term sheet agreement\u201d with Spirit that will see the planemaker take on facilities that make A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire in France. It will also seek to buy the A220 wing and mid-fuselage production in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco, as well as A220 pylon manufacturing at Spirit\u2019s headquarters, it said.\n\nThe transaction is set to close in the middle of next year. Boeing said it\u2019s taking over \u201csubstantially all Boeing-related commercial operations,\u201d as well as additional commercial, defense and aftermarket operations.\n\nThe deal struck after months of negotiations comes as Boeing approaches another milestone, a settlement with the US Justice Department that would potentially involve pleading guilty to criminal fraud in relation to two crashes involving the 737 Max aircraft that occurred in rapid succession in 2018 and 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US government plans to charge Boeing, leaving the planemaker to choose between pleading guilty or taking the risk of going to trial, according to people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.\n\nThe effort to buy back Spirit will likely be welcomed by US aviation regulators concerned about manufacturing quality lapses as the companies deal with massive worker turnover following the pandemic. But the tie-up and dissolution of Spirit would also need to be approved by Pentagon and US antitrust regulators increasingly concerned about consolidating aerospace and defense manufacturing.\n\nThe Boeing transaction, once completed, will reunite assets that for decades once sat under one roof, bringing together thousands of workers and decades of shared expertise. It also brings a longtime former Boeing leader back to the company as directors hunt for a new leader, with Calhoun set to step down at the end of the year.\n\nSpirit Aero CEO Pat Shanahan was a longtime Boeing executive steeped in factory operations, known for helping turn around the 787 Dreamliner after a troubled start. He\u2019s considered a potential contender to succeed Calhoun in Boeing\u2019s top role.\n\nSpirit has faced growing financial pressure and scrutiny alongside Boeing after the door-shaped panel on a 737 Max 9 model blew out minutes after takeoff. Shipments of 737 fuselages have plummeted as Boeing steps up its inspections in Kansas and back at home near Seattle, and declined to accept aircraft structures with missing components or incomplete work.\n\nFor Boeing, the deal brings a key supplier for the 737, 787 Dreamliner and other commercial jets back in-house at a time when the company is feeling the financial strain from the slowed-down output. Boeing lost about $4 billion in cash in the first quarter and is set to bleed a similar amount in the current three months of the year. The company\u2019s credit rating is hovering one level above speculative grade, and management is keen to avoid slipping into junk territory.\n\nPJT Partners was the financial adviser to Boeing, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Consello acting as additional advisers.\n\n--With assistance from Siddharth Philip and Allyson Versprille.\n\n(Updates with financial details from second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "The S&P 500 is near an all-time high, but not all stocks are performing quite so well. If you look closely, there are still some excellent bargains in the stock market, especially if you look beyond the high-growth tech stocks making most of the headlines. With that in mind, here are three value investments you can make right now. I own all three in my own portfolio and am quite confident they'll be stellar performers for patient investors.\n\n3 Value stocks that could outperform the market through 2030\n\nWithout further delay, here are three value stocks that could outperform the market for the remainder of the decade, and some reasons why.\n\n1. Starbucks\n\nCoffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has had a rough 2024. The company reported a surprising decline in same-store sales in the first quarter, as well as a 6% decline in customer traffic, and the stock took a nosedive. Even after a bit of a rebound, Starbucks trades for more than 25% below its 52-week high.\n\nDespite the poor stock performance, it's important to realize that the issues are due to temporary headwinds, such as pressure on consumer discretionary spending. Plus, Starbucks has been doing an even better job than planned when it comes to making supply chains more efficient, expecting $4 billion in savings over the next four years.\n\n2. Realty Income\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the leading real estate investment trusts, or REITs. If you aren't familiar with its business, Realty Income owns more than 15,400 properties in the U.S. and Europe and is designed to produce predictable and growing rental income over time.\n\nThe stock is down by about 35% from its all-time high (reached just before the COVID-19 pandemic), but it's important to realize the business is doing fine. REITs are highly sensitive to rising interest rates, and Realty Income -- which has a strong history of market-beating returns for the past three decades -- could be a big winner as rates normalize. Realty Income is one of the largest investments in my own stock portfolio, and one that I plan to hold for decades to come.\n\n3. Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF\n\nTwo of the most undervalued groups of stocks right now are small caps and value stocks, and the Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VBR) lets you invest in both of them, without too much exposure to any single company.\n\nSmall caps are trading for their lowest price-to-book valuation compared to the S&P 500 in more than 25 years. And over the past decade, growth stocks as a group have outperformed value stocks by a staggering 168 percentage points.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are some solid arguments in favor of these types of stocks right now. For one thing, the last time the small cap valuation gap was this wide, they ended up outperforming the S&P 500 for more than a decade. And if interest rates start to fall, they could make borrowing costs lower (value stocks are more likely to use debt than growth) and could also cause consumer spending activity to accelerate.\n\nRemember the goal of value investing\n\nAs a final thought, keep in mind that value investing is a long-term practice. I have absolutely no idea what these stocks will do over the next few months or for the rest of 2024, and neither does anyone else. But these are three excellent investments that look like excellent values for long-term investors right now, and I'm quite confident that investors with a time horizon of five years or more will be glad they bought at the current levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

(AP) \u2014 Boeing announced plans to aquire Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in an all-stock transaction for the manufacturing firm, which already was part of the aerospace company's manufacturing chain.\n\nBoeing, located in Arlington, Virginia, announced the purchase in a statement late Sunday.\n\nThe acquisition's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit\u2019s last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.\n\nSpirit, located in Wichita, Kansas, manufactures key parts for Boeing aircraft. Spirit also announced the acquisition on its website and social media.\n\n\u201cWe believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,\u201d Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in the statement.\n\nBoeing previously owned Spirit and the aerospace company said bringing the supplier back into the Boeing fold would improve plane quality and safety, which has come under increasing scrutiny by regulators, Congress and airlines.\n\n\u201cBy reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our Safety and Quality Management Systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes \u2014 centered on safety and quality,\" Calhoun said.\n\nThe purchase of Spirit would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes. That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.\n\nConcerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon.

        "title": "Halfway Into 2024: 2 Underperforming \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off",
        "body": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" represent some of the strongest businesses around. However, a few members of this elite group have failed to live up to expectations in the first half of 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the widely followed S&P 500 index has climbed 14.8% through June 26, but weak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which are up 11.6%. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the worst performer, with a recent dip in sales from its electric cars sending the stock down 21%.\n\nSometimes, betting on strong companies when they are experiencing temporary weakness can pay off over the long run. Indeed, both companies have promising growth opportunities unfolding in artificial intelligence (AI), which could have a huge impact on shareholder returns over the next decade.\n\nHere's why these stocks are ready to take off.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWeak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple stock year to date, but since the company's last earnings report in early May, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, with the shares up 21%. The stock got a significant bounce following the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where Apple unveiled highly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features coming to iOS 18 later this year.\n\nApple Intelligence will be the biggest update to Apple's operating system in years. The AI features in this update will allow users to summarize long texts, create images, and receive personalized search assistance from Siri, just to name a few highlights.\n\nOf course, Apple has a profitable business angle here. While iOS 18 will be free to download like previous updates, the AI features will require devices with more recent processors, such as the A17 Pro chip found on the iPhone. iOS 18 will be a huge incentive for users with older devices to upgrade, and that could lead to record iPhone revenue during the holiday quarter.\n\nBeyond iOS 18, iPhone 16 is also expected to come in a new larger size of 6.9 inches for the Pro Max version, which could be enough to drive strong demand on its own. It's all setting up for a stretch of improving revenue growth over the next year.\n\nWall Street analysts are increasingly bullish. The current consensus is that Apple's sales will grow just 3% in fiscal 2025, but Evercore ISI recently raised its growth forecast from 4% to 7% and even sees a scenario where Apple could report double-digit top-line growth next year.\n\nMore analysts may raise their growth estimates as the launch of iOS 18 draws closer, which could send the stock even higher in the second half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the push into AI software could also benefit Apple's higher-margin services business (e.g., app sales) and drive above-average earnings growth. For these reasons, Apple is likely heading into a stretch of accelerating growth that could launch the stock higher over the next few years.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla shares have been slashed in half from their all-time high. A few reasons are to blame, including weak car demand amid rising interest rates and the uncertainty around the recent shareholder vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's 2018 performance award.\n\nWith shareholders recently voting to reinstate Musk's $56 billion pay package, it removes a major cloud over the stock since some investors were concerned that Musk might eventually leave Tesla if the vote didn't pass. However, the stock has moved higher since the vote as investors turn their attention back to Tesla's growth opportunities.\n\nTesla plans to unveil Cybercab in August, which opens up a massive market for the company. Analysts expect most of Tesla's revenue to come from the robotaxi market over the long term, which is significant, given that the company's $626 billion market cap is mostly based on its revenue from electric cars that generate more than 80% of the company's revenue right now. However, RBC Capital sees 52% of Tesla's valuation will ultimately be driven by robotaxis, 27% by full-self-driving car software, 15% by Megapack batteries, and only 6% by electric cars.\n\nMusk compared Tesla's robotaxi business strategy to those of services like Airbnb and Uber. Tesla will operate some of the robotaxi fleet itself, while a certain number of customers can choose to contribute their own cars to the service. Tesla aims to one day have tens of millions of cars in its fleet worldwide. It would lead to a new high-margin revenue stream in service fees flowing back to Tesla.\n\nThe robotaxi opportunity reflects Tesla's growing capabilities in AI. It has about 35,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) currently used for AI training, but it plans to have more than twice that number by the end of 2024. These are not cheap, with each H100 selling for thousands of dollars. Tesla's capital expenditures have quadrupled over the last four years to $9 billion and will continue to grow.\n\nIf Tesla is successful in expanding its robotaxi service over the next decade, it could have a huge impact on the company's profitability and, therefore, lead to a higher valuation for Tesla stock. Given the company's history of proving critics wrong, it's worth keeping some shares of this Magnificent Seven stock among your stock holdings for a rainy day.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Over the long run, Wall Street has proven to be a bona fide wealth creator. Although other asset classes, such as bonds and housing, have made investors richer, nothing else comes remotely close to the average annual return that stocks have delivered for more than a century.\n\nRight now, Wall Street is enjoying yet another rip-roaring bull market. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have respectively increased by 18%, 43%, and 71%, as of the closing bell on June 27, 2024.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut if there's one given on Wall Street, it's that stocks don't move up in a straight line. While artificial intelligence (AI) and stock-split euphoria are fueling the current bull market, three predictive indicators with historically strong correlations to downside on Wall Street appear to foreshadow a potential stock market crash in 2024.\n\nA historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply\n\nTo be clear, no metric can, with guaranteed accuracy, forecast a short-term directional move for the major stock indexes. However, select indicators have historically had a knack for predicting downside in the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. U.S. M2 money supply is one such metric.\n\nM2 money supply comprises everything you'd find in M1 -- cash and coins in circulation, as well as demand deposits in a checking account -- and adds in money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000. Think of M1 as money that can be spent on the spot and M2 as money that can still be spent somewhat easily but requires more work to get to.\n\nFor nine decades, M2 money supply has been expanding with virtually no interruption. In other words, more capital has been needed in circulation to support a growing economy.\n\nWARNING: the Money Supply is officially contracting. \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\n\nThis has only happened 4 previous times in last 150 years.\n\n\n\nEach time a Depression with double-digit unemployment rates followed. \ud83d\ude2c pic.twitter.com/j3FE532oac -- Nick Gerli (@nickgerli1) March 8, 2023\n\nBut since peaking in April 2022, M2 has meaningfully fallen off. Although it's up 0.69% on a year-over-year basis, U.S. M2 money supply has declined by 3.49% on an aggregate basis since its all-time high. As you can see in the post on X from Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli, this marks only the fifth time since 1870 (when back-tested) that M2 has moved lower by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis (1878, 1893, 1921, 1931-1933, and 2023).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe four previous instances where M2 fell by at least 2% correlated with periods of double-digit unemployment and economic depressions. While two of these instances occurred prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve, and the likelihood of a depression is very low today, the takeaway is that less capital in circulation leads to fewer discretionary purchases by consumers. In short, it's a recipe for a recession -- and the stock market historically performs poorly once a recession has been declared.\n\nThe longest yield-curve inversion of the modern era\n\nThe second predictive tool that appears to portend trouble for Wall Street is the Treasury yield curve. Compared to the M2 money supply, this is a much more popular metric.\n\nNormally, the Treasury yield curve slopes up and to the right. This is to say that longer-dated Treasury bonds (those maturing in 10 or 30 years) sport higher yields than Treasury bills set to mature in a year or less. The longer your money is tied up in an interest-bearing asset, the higher the yield should be.\n\n10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread Chart\n\nSince July 5, 2022, the spread (difference in yield) between the 10-year bond and the two-year Treasury bill has been underwater. In other words, Treasury securities maturing in two years have had a higher yield than the 10-year Treasury bond. This is what's known as a yield-curve inversion, and it's the longest one of the modern era.\n\nHere's the interesting thing about yield-curve inversions: They've preceded every single U.S. recession since the end of World War II. Approximately two-thirds of the S&P 500's peak-to-trough drawdowns have occurred during U.S. recessions.\n\nHowever, and this is a big \"however,\" not every yield-curve inversion has been followed by a recession. Think of a yield-curve inversion as a necessary ingredient that signals the U.S. economy is facing headwinds.\n\nStocks are exceptionally pricey\n\nThe third predictive metric that suggests a potential stock market crash may be forthcoming is the valuation-based Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, also commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio.\n\nWhereas the traditional P/E ratio focuses on trailing-12-month earnings, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior 10 years. Examining 10 years' worth of earnings history smooths out the \"hiccups\" (e.g., the effects of COVID-19) that might otherwise skew investors' perceptions of value.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nAs of the closing bell on June 27, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E stood at 35.70. For some context, this is more than double its 17.13 average when back-tested over the last 153 years.\n\nWhat's of interest with the Shiller P/E is examining how Wall Street's major stock indexes have responded when it's surpassed 30 during a bull market. Since 1871, this has occurred six times: 1) August 1929-September 1929, 2) June 1997-August 2001, 3) September 2017-November 2018, 4) December 2019-February 2020, 5) August 2020-May 2022, and 6) November 2023-current.\n\nThe five prior instances of the Shiller P/E ratio topping 30 eventually resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite shedding between 20% and 89% of their value.\n\nAs you can see by the dates of these six instances, there's no rhyme or reason for how long stocks can remain pricey. What is clear is that extended valuations aren't sustained over the long run. When the S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio tops 30 for any length of time, it's historically been a cautionary tale that a bear market and/or potential crash awaits.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTime and perspective change everything\n\nTo reiterate, the three predictive metrics above suggest the ingredients exist for a potential stock market crash in 2024. What they don't do is guarantee anything. It's impossible to concretely forecast what stocks will do a week, a month, or even a year from now.\n\nBut when investors take a step back and widen their perspectives, it becomes a lot easier to forecast where stocks are collectively headed.\n\nTake the economic cycle as a good example. No matter how much workers might loathe the idea of slowdowns and recessions, the fact remains that they're perfectly normal. No amount of well-wishing can stop recessions from occurring.\n\nHowever, this boom-bust cycle for the economy isn't linear. Since World War II ended in September 1945, nine of 12 U.S. recessions were resolved in less than a year, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months. By comparison, most periods of economic growth stuck around for multiple years, with two expansions lasting longer than 10 years. Being an optimist and betting on the U.S. economy to expand has, without question, been a smart move.\n\nThis same dynamic plays out on Wall Street.\n\nIt's official. A new bull market is confirmed.\n\n\n\nThe S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.\n\n\n\nRead more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp -- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023\n\nIn June 2023, Bespoke Investment Group made the post you see above on X. It highlights the calendar length of every bear and bull market in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What you'll note is that the average length of bull markets (1,011 calendar days) for the S&P 500 is roughly 3.5 times longer than the typical S&P 500 bear market (286 calendar days).\n\nTo add, almost half of the S&P 500 bull markets (13 of 27) stuck around longer than the lengthiest bear market over a 94-year stretch.\n\nAn extensive data set from the investment advisors at Crestmont Research adds to the value of time and perspective. Crestmont's analysts calculated the rolling 20-year total returns of the S&P 500, including dividends, when back-tested to 1900. This research yielded 105 rolling 20-year periods (1919-2023).\n\nWhat this data set showed was that all 105 rolling 20-year periods would have produced a positive annualized total return. In plain English, if you had hypothetically purchased an S&P 500 tracking index at any point since 1900 and held that position for 20 years, you'd have made money, without fail, every single time.\n\nNo matter how scary the data or short-term predictions may appear, time and perspective haven't let investors down.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- French markets rallied and the euro gained on bets Marine Le Pen\u2019s party was poised to win the first round of France\u2019s legislative election with a smaller margin than some polls had indicated, making it less likely the far right would secure an absolute majority.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCAC 40 stock futures jumped 2.8% at the open, the euro climbed 0.4% to $1.0757 while bond futures pointed to modest gains, with the yield on France\u2019s 10-year note indicated two basis points lower.\n\nInitial projections showed Le Pen\u2019s far-right party in front of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front \u2014 but with potentially less of the vote than it needs to secure an absolute majority after a second round of polling July 7.\n\nInvestors have been concerned that a strong showing for Le Pen\u2019s National Rally would increase the odds of expansive fiscal policy, bringing the nation\u2019s bloated fiscal accounts sharply into focus and further muddying the outlook for the common currency.\n\n\u201cThe fear was already priced in the markets so there was no real case for a drop this morning,\u201d said Stephane Ekolo, equity strategist at TFS Derivatives. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid for France after the election is a Liz Truss moment and a burst in stress for the French debt.\u201d\n\nThe focus now turns to whether her party can garner enough support July 7 to get an absolute majority in the National Assembly, which would allow it to pass legislation more easily. President Emmanuel Macron and her other opponents are already strategizing to keep the far-right party out of power, with any signs of progress likely to bolster the case for a relief rally.\n\n\u201cWe now have a week of horse-trading ahead of us,\u201d said Joachim Klement, head of strategy, accounting and sustainability at Liberum Capital, who expects the euro to strengthen through the week as alliances are formed to reduce the gains of Le Pen\u2019s party.\n\nWhat Bloomberg strategists say...\n\nIf the leftist alliance is \u201cis aimed at blocking Le Pen\u2019s grouping from getting a majority in the crucial second round, it has wide-ranging implications for the France-German spread and indeed the euro. If the upshot is that we will get a more centrist government, it would be positive for the currency and herald a narrower spread.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2014 Ven Ram, cross-asset strategist for MLIV\n\nThe National Rally was projected to get as much as 34% of the vote, according to analysis from five polling companies late Sunday. Bloomberg\u2019s final poll of polls on Friday put them at 36.2%.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front coalition was set to get about 29% and Macron\u2019s centrist alliance between 21% and 22%, projections on Sunday showed.\n\n\u201cBoth camps\u2019 fiscal policies are disruptive for the French economy and the prospects for the French debt,\u201d said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, referring to the National Rally party and the New Popular Front coalition. \u201cFor me it\u2019s still wait-and-see.\u201d\n\nIf alliances forming to block Le Pen from absolute power start to look credible, French markets would likely recover, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n\u201cA hung parliament could make it hard to get anything done in France in the current parliament, which is exactly what the markets would like,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, strategists warn there is likely volatility ahead, as the electoral calculus gets complicated in the runoff when parties can strategically withhold candidates in certain constituencies to give a boost to a centrist hopeful.\n\nVolatility Is Only Certainty for Traders Parsing French Results\n\nMacron\u2019s decision to call a snap vote in early June had sent markets into a tailspin.\n\nHis party \u2014 which supports large spending cuts to get France\u2019s budget deficit under control \u2014 suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections. National Rally, meanwhile, has touted some costly budget measures including lowering the sales tax on energy and fuel.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French bonds over safer German debt rocketed to more than 80 basis points, levels last seen during the euro area\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. The euro fell to its lowest since early May.\n\nFiscal Pressures\n\nWhile the 10-year yield spread may find some relief as trading starts on Monday, it\u2019s hard to see a \u201cmaterial and sustainable snapback,\u201d said Peter Goves, head of developed market debt sovereign research at MFS Investment Management.\n\n\u201cUncertainties are high, French fundamentals haven\u2019t changed and the final outcome is still unknown and unknowable with the large number of three-way contests complicating matters,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a projected 5.3% of output this year, France\u2019s budget deficit already far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules. The International Monetary Fund predicts without further measures, debt would rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, and increase by about 1.5 percentage points a year over the medium-term.\n\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli, Julien Ponthus and Farah Elbahrawy.\n\n(Updates market moves.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump.\n\nTaiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters.\n\n\"The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,\" Corio added.\n\nRegions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power.\n\nNew Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters.\n\nGoogle and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline.\n\nTaiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said.\n\nCorio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region.\n\nSharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added.\n\n(Editing by Alexander Smith)",

        "body": "The epic rally in shares of tech behemoths is far outpacing their profits, and it could mean the S&P 500 is looking more vulnerable, according to Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k.\n\nIn a note on Sunday, he pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 account for 35% of the index's market value but only 23% of its earnings.\n\n\"This divergence has never been bigger, suggesting that the market is record bullish on future earnings for the top 10 companies in the index,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"In other words, the problem for the S&P 500 today is not only the high concentration but also the record-high bullishness on future earnings from a small group of companies.\"\n\nBecause the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, soaring share prices of Big Tech companies rushing into the AI boom has meant that recent gains are concentrated into just a handful of stocks, obscuring the relative mediocrity for rest of the index.\n\nBefore Nvidia began its selloff earlier this month, the AI chip leader accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500\u2019s rally this year.\n\n\u201cSuch a high concentration implies that if Nvidia continues to rise, then things are fine,\u201d Sl\u00f8k warned on June 12. \u201cBut if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.\u201d\n\nAs market leadership becomes more concentrated, so are investors' portfolios, especially as putting money in funds that track indexes becomes increasingly popular.\n\nBank of America analysts said in a recent note that the average large-cap fund has 33% of its portfolio in its top five holdings, up from just 26% in December 2022.\n\nSimilarly, the share of funds the have more than 40% of their portfolio in their top five holdings has jumped to 25% from less 5% in December 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street analysts have been bullish on the S&P 500 and are scrambling to raise their year-end targets. Even one of the biggest bears has surrendered and is now one of the most bullish analysts.\n\nAnd Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee recently said the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of the decade.

        "body": "(Reuters) -Boeing said on Monday it would buy Spirit AeroSystems in a $4.7 billion all-stock deal following months of talks, as it tries to resolve a sprawling corporate and industrial crisis that has also engulfed the key supplier.\n\nBoeing said the total deal value was about $8.3 billion including debt. Each share of Spirit common stock will be exchanged for between 0.18 and 0.25 Boeing shares, resulting in an equity value of about $37.25 per share, as reported by Reuters on Sunday.\n\nSpirit's shares closed at $32.87 on Friday.\n\nSeparately, Airbus, also a Spirit customer, said it would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco as well as minor activities in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe Airbus part of the deal was triggered by Boeing's decision to buy back its former subsidiary, which had branched out into supplying Airbus and others since becoming independent from Boeing almost two decades ago.\n\nBecause the Airbus-related activities lose money, industry sources had said the European planemaker was pressing for up to $1 billion in compensation in return for taking over the plants, which make strategic parts for the A350 and A220 jets.\n\nAirbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, depending on the final outlines of the deal, while it would pay Spirit a symbolic $1 for the assets.\n\nSpirit said it also planned to sell businesses and operations in Prestwick, Scotland and in Subang, Malaysia that support Airbus programs.

        "title": "Should You Buy CrowdStrike Stock Now That It's Part of the S&P 500?",
        "body": "The latest rebalancing for the S&P 500 took place in mid-June, and cybersecurity darling CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) earned a spot in the esteemed index. While getting added to the S&P 500 is an impressive milestone, it's not reason enough to buy a stock. Nevertheless, CrowdStrike is firing on all cylinders, and I think it's best days are ahead.\n\nLet's dig into the company's progress and explore why now is a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors to own CrowdStrike.\n\nCrowdStrike is in a league of its own\n\nCrowdStrike operates in the cybersecurity industry and specializes in threat detection and endpoint protection through its flagship platform, called Falcon. While the cybersecurity landscape is ripe with competition, CrowdStrike stands out as a winner, thanks to its proven ability to cross-sell.\n\nFor the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), nearly two-thirds of CrowdStrike's total customers were using five or more products. Moreover, new deals with eight or more products increased 95% year over year. By selling multiple products to its customer base, CrowdStrike can expand its recurring revenue base, all while recognizing strong profit growth.\n\nFor the quarter ended April 30, CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 33% year over year to $3.7 billion. Furthermore, the company posted net income of $43 million during the first quarter, compared to just $0.5 million during the same period last year.\n\nThe combination of accelerating revenue and profit growth is encouraging, and I think it's just getting started.\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nThe party is just getting started\n\nBack in 2022, CrowdStrike released an investor presentation showcasing a total addressable market (TAM) size of $75 billion at that time. Management further explained that with the company's current product portfolio at that time, the TAM could reach $97 billion by 2025 and $158 billion by 2026 should CrowdStrike execute on its new-product roadmap.\n\nClearly, a lot has changed over the last couple of years. Not only are cybersecurity protocols more important than ever to combat hackers and protect data and privacy, but developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are making their way to just about every use case in the tech realm.\n\nAccording to the company's most recent investor presentation, CrowdStrike now believes its TAM is $100 billion. What's more, management sees the addressable market expanding to $225 billion by 2028 as generative AI becomes increasingly featured in cybersecurity tools.\n\nIs CrowdStrike a good stock to buy right now?\n\nCrowdStrike has proven that it can compete in an intense cybersecurity market and do so in a highly profitable way. Moreover, as AI demand continues to surge, the company should be in a position to benefit from secular tailwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe one drawback of investing in CrowdStrike is its pricey valuation. Right now, its stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 96 and a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple of 93.\n\nSimply put, the stock is expensive -- even for growth investors. With that said, I still think CrowdStrike is a compelling opportunity.\n\nThe rate at which the company and its addressable market are growing shouldn't go unnoticed. Cybersecurity in and of itself is a big market, and CrowdStrike has built a formidable position, even though there are many larger, better-capitalized players. Furthermore, now that AI has become increasingly more important for businesses of all sizes, CrowdStrike fits squarely at the intersection of two of the tech sector's hottest end markets.\n\nConsidering the company's ARR of $3.7 billion represents only 1.6% of the current estimated market size, CrowdStrike has a long way to go before its business starts to mature or plateau.\n\nI think CrowdStrike's premium valuation is warranted and I am optimistic the company can continue generating strong top-line growth, supplemented by robust cash flow. Long-term investors may want to consider a position in CrowdStrike as a hedge to other AI stocks. It's a leading company among cybersecurity opportunities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "These 3 Stocks Are Down in 2024, but Look Set for a Spectacular Recovery in the Second Half",
        "body": "Shares in UPS (NYSE: UPS), aerospace materials company Hexcel (NYSE: HXL), and security doors and locks company Allegion (NYSE: ALLE) have all experienced a significant dip so far in 2024, lagging behind the S&P 500 index's 14.6% gain over the same period. However, compelling evidence suggests that all three are positioned to outperform the market in the second half and beyond. Here's why.\n\nThe investment case for UPS stock\n\nUPS, the package delivery giant, faced a tumultuous 2023, with some challenges spilling into the first half of 2024. Slowing economic growth has led to declining volume growth and revenue growth. A costly labor contract resolution further exacerbated the situation. To make matters worse, the prolonged labor negotiations led to customers diverting their deliveries to other networks, fearing a strike action.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, these headwinds will turn into tailwinds in the second half as management believes year-over-year volume growth will start in the second quarter in the U.S. Meanwhile, the cost increases due to the labor contract are now in the numbers, so comparisons with last year will get easier. UPS is making 12,000 job cuts in response to weaker demand.\n\nEverything points to a stronger second half, and management's guidance calls for adjusted operating profit to increase by 20% to 30% in the second half compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe key to the turnaround and the metric investors should watch closely when UPS reports its second-quarter earnings on July 23 is a return to delivery volume growth in the U.S. Management previously said it expected slightly positive average daily volume growth in the U.S. in the second quarter. If it occurs, then UPS will be well on its way to a recovery in 2024.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHexcel investors are worried about Boeing\n\nThere's little doubt that Hexcel has great long-term growth prospects. Its advanced composites offer a weight and strength advantage over traditional materials like aluminum. That's a big issue in aerospace as it helps optimize fuel consumption and reduce lifecycle operating and maintenance costs, particularly on widebody airplanes.\n\nAs such, there's a clear trend of new airplanes using more advanced composite materials. Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs and are looking to ramp up production. Everything points to a bright future for Hexcel.\n\nThat said, there will be some near-term turbulence in 2024, and that's why the company's stock has declined.\n\nUPS Chart\n\nIn a nutshell, since there's little aftermarket demand for Hexcel's products, when airplane deliveries slow at one of its ultimate end market customers, in this case, Boeing, Hexcel could feel it in its orders. Unfortunately, the slowdown at Boeing is creating uncertainty, and investors are concerned. Moreover, Hexcel has been building its infrastructure to support future solid growth, holding back near-term profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nPutting it together, it's understandable that investors might have concerns. Still, these are near-term issues, and Boeing will surely ramp up its airplane production rate in the second half and increase it in the future. As such, investors in Hexcel can look forward to an ongoing recovery in sales and margin growth in the coming years.\n\nAllegion secures the future\n\nThe security door and lock maker also has a bright future. It's leading the movement toward the convergence of electronic and mechanical security products, which has myriad benefits. Wireless-enabled technology allows building owners to monitor and control access areas remotely. Consequently, they can reduce shrinkage, improve security, grant and deny access daily, and improve workflow productivity by knowing which workers are in which areas at all times.\n\nThe added value is significant, and given that only about 30% of sales are from electronic products and the adoption rate of electronic locks is only 10% in North America, there's ample growth potential.\n\nStill, investors are concerned with the company's exposure to the North American residential market in 2024, and it doesn't help that overall sales in the first quarter were down 3.6% organically year over year.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, both issues are likely to prove temporary. The North American housing market will improve in a lower interest rate environment. In addition, the revenue decline in the first quarter is largely down to a tough comparison with the first quarter of 2023, when organic sales increased by 15% on an organic basis. On a two-year comparison, sales increased by 5.3% on a compound annual growth rate basis.\n\nAs such, the dip in the share price looks to be an excellent buying opportunity in a long-term growth story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Palantir Stock Is Up 40% So Far This Year. Where Will This AI Winner Land at the End of 2024?",
        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the market to start 2024. Nvidia recently became the most valuable company in the world and is up more than 150% year to date (YTD). Investors are betting that AI is going to be a huge market opportunity as the large technology players spend tens of billions on it.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is one of these AI companies. Shares are up 40% YTD with accelerating revenue growth as customers adopt its intelligent software and analytics tools. Where will this AI winner land by the end of 2024? Let's take a closer look and find out.\n\nIntelligent software for defense and commercial customers\n\nAt its core, Palantir builds custom advanced analytics software. Customers range from the United States military and its allies (U.S. government revenue was more than $250 million last quarter alone) to the private sector. Corporations -- especially larger ones -- utilize Palantir's tools to analyze operations and track how a business is performing.\n\nRecently, Palantir has pushed its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) for its customer base. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on how these tools actually work, but automated intelligence that provides useful insights can be important for complex organizations.\n\nAnd it looks like these tools work. Over the last 12 months, Palantir generated $2.33 billion in revenue. It has 554 total customers, 427 of which are commercial organizations (i.e., not government agencies). This is up from just 49 commercial customers at the end of 2020.\n\nAccelerating growth and profitability\n\nOver the last few quarters, Palantir's revenue growth started to accelerate again. This is likely why the stock is up so much this year; investors love an accelerating top line. Last quarter, revenue grew 21% year over year to $634 million, driven by 27% growth in the commercial segment. Back in 2023, revenue growth had sunk to around 12% year over year.\n\nProfitability is shining right now, which is a great sign for the stock. Net income over the last 12 months was $300 million, which is a huge improvement from $500 million to $1 billion annual losses a few years ago. Palantir is proving that it can grow efficiently (meaning while generating a profit), a sign of a healthy software business.\n\nPLTR PS Ratio Chart\n\nPLTR PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nWhere will it sit at the end of 2024\n\nPalantir is an exciting company. Revenue should continue to grow as more and more organizations embrace AI and software analytics. The stock still looks expensive, though, and I wouldn't buy it in the summer of 2024. Let's run through some numbers to show why.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Palantir has a market cap of $54 billion. That gives the stock a trailing price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 24. Remember, this is a sales ratio, not based on profits. With an operating margin of 8%, Palantir does not generate much in earnings for every dollar in sales. Margins are likely to expand over time, but that is not certain.\n\nBut even with expanding margins the stock still looks expensive. Assuming Palantir can grow its revenue by 30% a year for five years (an acceleration from current levels), it will generate $8.65 billion in earnings five years from now. At a 30% profit margin, that equates to $2.6 billion in earnings, or a five-year forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 21.\n\nThat is not much lower than the S&P 500 index's long-term P/E level.

        "title": "Energy price cap change mean lower bills but relief may be temporary",
        "body": "Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\n\n8 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\n\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \u00a31,723 in October, a \u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\n\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\n\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\n\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\n\nLatest changes in detail\n\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\n\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\n\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \u00a31,522\n\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \u00a31,668\n\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\n\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down",

In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: \"They suspend closure, we suspend action.\"\n\nUnite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs.

Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community\u2019s national officer, said the letter \"simply reaffirms\" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action.

        "title": "Will Biden's green jobs policy help him win votes?",
        "body": "Will Biden's green jobs policy help him win votes?\n\n7 hours ago By Michelle Fleury , North America Business correspondent Share\n\nBBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia\n\nThe former \u201ccarpet capital of the world\u201d is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2013 his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.\n\nThe most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year\u2019s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn\u2019t appear to have lifted the incumbent\u2019s support. President Biden\u2019s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it\u2019s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.\n\nQcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables\n\nScott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an \u201caccelerant\u201d. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. \u201cWhat our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,\u201d he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals \u2013 not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: \u201cIn the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].\u201d Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. \u201cThe business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,\u201d says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump\u2019s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. \u201cNobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the \u2018latte liberals\u2019 care about in the big city.\u201d\n\nQcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton\n\nWell, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It\u2019s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump\u2019s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden\u2019s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton\u2019s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Caf\u00e9, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn\u2019t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be speaking with the Trump team\u201d. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton\u2019s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of \u201csolar panel capital of the world\u201d.\n\nBut that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world\u2019s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US\u2019s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the \u201csignificant distortion\u201d in the global economy caused by China.\n\nKasey Carpenter, a Republican, says he is not fearful that a possible Trump government would hit the solar sector",

        "title": "Okta: The Turnaround Is Underway (NASDAQ:OKTA)",
        "body": "alengo/E+ via Getty Images\n\nI am finally warming up again to Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) after a brief period on the sidelines. The cybersecurity company is showing real signs of accelerating growth rates, yet the fundamental momentum is not being reflected in the stock price or valuation. The company has a net cash balance sheet, is generating positive cash flow, and appears within striking distance of GAAP profitability. There is still some uncertainty regarding competitive threats given the perceived commoditized nature of the product, but thus far these fears have remained just that. Management continues to guide conservatively, but I am gaining confidence that they may be able to return to a \u201cbeat and raise\u201d cadence moving forward. I am upgrading the stock to buy.\n\nOKTA Stock Price\n\nI last covered OKTA in April, where I reiterated my neutral rating given my low confidence in the company\u2019s growth prospects against its then-valuation. The stock has underperformed the broader markets since then, but the company\u2019s latest results indicate that my hesitance may have been misplaced.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nGiven the company\u2019s strong balance sheet and solid profitability, the valuation looks attractive at these levels, even if the growth story isn\u2019t as clear-cut as typical cybersecurity names.\n\nOKTA Stock Key Metrics\n\nOKTA is an enterprise tech company in the cybersecurity sector, offering identity and access management products. An easy way to think about their products is like \u201ctwo-factor authentication\u201d for enterprises, to secure all apps made available for employees.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nIn its most recent quarter, OKTA delivered 19% YoY revenue growth, surpassing guidance for 17% growth.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nOKTA saw current remaining performance obligations grow 15% YoY to $1.949 billion, surpassing guidance for 13% growth. That strong result may indicate that revenue growth should remain in the double-digits at least in the near term.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nOKTA reported an 111% trailing twelve months dollar-based net retention rate, representing stabilization from the fourth quarter. I view this to be a solid result given that many tech names have seen pressure to customer headcount growth amidst the higher interest rate environment and the rise of generative AI.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nOn the profitability front, OKTA generated a 21.6% non-GAAP operating margin, crushing guidance for 18%. Notably, the $47 million GAAP operating loss was a large improvement compared to prior quarters and shows clearly how close the company is getting to GAAP profitability.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nOKTA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash versus $1.2 billion of debt, representing a strong net cash balance sheet.\n\nLooking ahead, management has guided for the second quarter to see up to 14% revenue growth and 11% cRPO growth. Consensus estimates call for $633 million in revenues.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nFor the full year, management raised revenue guidance only slightly from 11% up to 12%. Given the size of the beat in this past quarter, it is clear that there is a great deal of conservatism baked into that target.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nOn the conference call, management noted that their cautious guidance is due to them still assessing the impact from their October security incident. Yet even if growth does end up slowing at some point, management appeared to remain optimistic about long-term prospects, stating that they \u201care not here to be a slow growth company\u201d and are still aiming to accelerate growth rates. Management noted that they did see some of the headcount pressures facing other software peers but noted that they have been able to offset declining seat count with new products. It is possible that OKTA, like other headcount-based software peers, may eventually see a macro-related boost to growth rates as their customers return to historical hiring patterns.\n\nIs OKTA Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOKTA is one of the stocks that investors have seemingly labeled as being in the crosshairs of the \u201csoftware death star\u201d in Microsoft (MSFT), but based on the company\u2019s assessment as well as a cursory glance of user reviews, OKTA still appears to be offering a stronger product.\n\nFY25 Q1 Presentation\n\nI am of the view that Wall Street is missing the big picture here. OKTA has a recurring revenue base backed by a net cash balance sheet and positive free cash flow generation. The company may be able to achieve GAAP profitability within 1 to 2 years if management allows operating leverage to take hold. I can see the company sustaining at least 35% net margins over the long term but will use 30% for modeling purposes. Yet, the stock recently traded hands at just around 6x sales.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThat implies a 20x long-term earnings multiple, which looks too low given the projected double-digit forward revenue growth rate and aforementioned strong balance sheet. I can see the stock eventually re-rating to the 8x sales range, equating to around 26.6x long-term earnings. Between the double-digit growth rate and multiple expansion potential, I can see OKTA beating the market from here over the long term.\n\nOKTA Stock Risks\n\nIt is possible that the October security incident (along with the numerous others) just have not yet impacted the financials as of yet. Perhaps there are some large renewals coming up that may not go as smoothly as planned. Perhaps MSFT is able to take increasing market share and pressure the growth rate. OKTA is not yet GAAP profitable, and thus the stock might exhibit great volatility under poor market conditions.\n\nOKTA Stock Conclusion\n\nOKTA is not growing as fast nor as profitable as more famous cybersecurity peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD), but the stock looks attractive in its own right. For one, the stock trades at much lower multiples on a price to sales basis and the company still has a net cash balance sheet and non-GAAP profitability. I can see the stock delivering solid double-digit returns from here, especially if revenue growth can eventually accelerate. I am upgrading the stock to buy.",

        "title": "1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 70%, According to Loop Capital",
        "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is in full swing, and according to one Wall Street analyst, things don't appear to be slowing down any time soon for one extremely well-positioned company.\n\nWhile most investors are gravitating toward chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the moment, AI is and will continue to mint other market winners as well. In fact, one S&P 500 AI company has outperformed even Nvidia this year. And despite this stock's impressive 2024 run, one Wall Street analyst predicts another 70% surge.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has beaten Nvidia and is ready for a liquid cooling breakout\n\nThis year, server-maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has already surged 212%, handily outperforming Nvidia's impressive 149% year-to-date gain.\n\nSupermicro has undoubtedly benefited handily from a close partnership with Nvidia as a preferred server partner. However, the company has also been gaining market share thanks to its in-house engineering prowess.\n\nSupermicro's strategy of building servers out of \"building block\" pieces allows for fast, large-scale customization while also saving customers money. With the building block architecture, parts of a server are easily swapped and upgraded rather than having to replace the whole unit.\n\nMoreover, the building block architecture and close relationship with Silicon Valley tech companies generally allow Supermicro to custom-build servers faster than rivals. With so many companies falling over themselves to build advanced AI infrastructure as quickly as possible, it's no wonder customers are flocking to Supermicro's solutions.\n\nSMCI Chart\n\nIn addition, Supermicro's longtime ethos of resource-saving, energy-efficient design has come to the fore in the age of AI. AI chips require a tremendous amount of energy and must dissipate lots of heat. To help further lower energy costs, Supermicro is now rolling out its own direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology.\n\nDLC technology has been around for decades. However, because it's an added cost and can take a long time to deploy in a data center, it has garnered only around 1% of the data center market.\n\nHowever, AI servers are becoming extremely energy-intensive and will soon require DLC as opposed to air-cooled racks. DLC data centers limit the need for extensive air conditioning systems, saving both energy and space within the data center and thereby allowing even denser server clusters.\n\nFrom its mere 1% market share, CEO Charles Liang expects a wave of DLC deployments to make up 15% of Supermicro racks this year and 30% next year. According to Liang, Supermicro can deliver DLC solutions within weeks today, and DLC deployment can help reduce data center power usage by up to 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite the company's 200% revenue growth last quarter, DLC's benefits to customers should help keep up the company's hypergrowth and margins for the foreseeable future.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer going to $1,500 per share? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLoop Capital thinks Supermicro is going to $1,500\n\nOver the past few years, Supermicro has routinely trounced even the most bullish analyst expectations. But with this year's admission to the S&P 500 Index, many more Wall Street analysts have begun covering the stock.\n\nOne of the most bullish is the technology-centered research shop Loop Capital. In April, Loop analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Super Micro Computer from $600 to $1,500 per share.\n\nExplaining the increase, Baruah correctly noted that Supermicro has developed a reputation as \"an increasing leader in the need for both complexity and scale\" for AI deployments. Furthermore, Baruah sees Supermicro's speed and agility as a key factor, elaborating, \"While it's not truly possible to know the magnitude of these wins or timeframe of deployments, there has been a general industry dynamic of standing up deployments faster as opposed to slower.\"\n\nTo obtain his valuation, Baruah sees Supermicro earning between $50 and $60 in fiscal 2026, ending in June of 2026, on revenue of between $30 billion and $40 billion. That compares with estimates for nearly $15 billion in revenue and $24 billion in fiscal 2024, which ends today, June 30.\n\nWith that type of growth and earnings power, Baruah thinks Supermicro can retain a 25 to 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, even in 2026. So, 30 times $50 or 25 times $60 gets one to his $1,500 target.\n\nSupermicro could be more advantaged than Nvidia\n\nWhile Nvidia is the king of AI chips today, the company is also due to receive an onslaught of competition from other processor companies and cloud giants' custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). However, Supermicro's servers can house any kind of AI chip.\n\nThus, Supermicro should see continued growth and share gains no matter which AI chip wins the day or even if the wins are spread out among several chipmakers. That makes the stock a solid buy today, even after its impressive year-to-date gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.
