        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\" \"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \"disastrous\" prospect.\" \"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\" said Bose. \"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\" she added.\n\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\" Bose said. \"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \"event of death, resignation or disability\" that leaves the role vacant.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.\n\nAmazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.\n\nStarting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.\n\nTwo people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.\n\nMatt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.\n\nAn AWS spokesperson confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley. The spokesperson added that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years.\n\nAmazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.\n\nBut Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.\n\nAmazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.\n\nLast month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft \"ran laps around\" AWS in generative AI.\n\nStartups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIn November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.\n\nStartups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.\n\nIn addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. \"Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,\" Adept said in a blog post.\n\nWATCH: AWS will boost investments in Singapore's cloud infrastructure by $9 billion",

        "body": "In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

President Biden and Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board on Friday urged President Joe Biden to exit the presidential election contest against Donald Trump, citing the Democrat's poor debate performance the previous night.\n\n\"The president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant,\" the Times editorial said. \"He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Biden has said that he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it. His argument rests largely on the fact that he beat Mr. Trump in 2020,\" it said. \"That is no longer a sufficient rationale for why Mr. Biden should be the Democratic nominee this year.\"\n\nThe stunning editorial came a day after Biden gave a blundering performance in his first debate against Trump in the 2024 White House race.\n\n''It should be remembered that Mr. Biden challenged Mr. Trump to this verbal duel,'' the editorial said. \"He set the rules, and he insisted on a date months earlier than any previous general election debate. He understood that he needed to address longstanding public concerns about his mental acuity and that he needed to do so as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"The truth Mr. Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test.\"\n\nThe editorial comes as a number of Democrats and fundraisers consider pushing for Biden to step aside in the contest.\n\nThe Times editorial board for decades has been the leading liberal newspaper editorial voice in the United States.\n\nBut in recent years, the paper's news section has been criticized by some liberals for its coverage of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and Biden.",

Navarro will soon complete serving his sentence.\n\nAn attorney for Bannon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the Supreme Court's order.\n\nBannon was convicted in July 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress after a trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. His jail sentence was stayed in October 2022 pending an appeal of his conviction.\n\nLast month, a three-judge federal appeals court panel upheld his conviction, rejecting an argument that Bannon did not break the law because his attorney had advised him not to comply with the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena because of the chance his testimony could be blocked by a claim of executive privilege.\n\nBannon is expected to ask the full appeals court in Washington, D.C., to rehear the appeal of his conviction. But the district judge in his case, Carl Nichols, on June 6 ordered him to report to jail to begin his sentence.\n\nLast week, Bannon asked the Supreme Court to suspend his surrender date pending his appeal. Friday's order by the high court rejected that bid, making it all but certain that Bannon will serve his sentence before his appeals are exhausted.\n\nThe bipartisan House panel was formed to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection, when a violent mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and forced Congress to delay certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nThe committee set its sights on Bannon in light of reporting that on Jan. 5, 2021, he had predicted that \"all hell is going to break loose\" the following day, and that he was involved in talks about how to overturn the election results.",

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

        "body": "Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.\n\nTractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.\n\nThe retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.\n\nTractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.\n\nTractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.\n\n\"Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,\" Tractor Supply said in the news release. \"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.\"\n\nTractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.\n\nThe retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.\n\nThe changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.\n\nCompanies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.",

The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,\" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. \"That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. \u2026 The batteries will never be affordable.\"\n\nA Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.\n\nFord earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed \"T3,\" from late 2025 to 2026.\n\nFarley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.\n\nHe also said Americans need to \"get back in love\" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.\n\n\"We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,\" Farley said Friday. \"We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.\"\n\nFord's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.\n\nFarley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.\n\n\"If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,\" he said. \"And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.\"",

        "body": "Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch \u2014 an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets: Wall Street is ending the final day of the second quarter on a muted note, even after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed a further cooling off in May . The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were flat in afternoon trading. The indexes, which are trying for a fourth consecutive day of gains, began the day higher. After minor advances Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, weighed down, in part, by Nike 's ugly earnings report. The sneaker company's shares fell 20%. Quarter end : The Dow is on track for a losing second quarter, down nearly 2% over the three-month timeframe. The 30-stock Dow had advanced in back-to-back quarters. Meanwhile, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are up about 4% and 9%, respectively, in the April-to-June period. That will be the third straight positive quarter for the indexes and the fifth over the past six. Investor optimism around artificial intelligence stocks once again took center stage in the second quarter. It fueled huge gains for the likes of Club names Nvidia , Apple and Broadcom , even when factoring in the recent for volatility for some AI winners. Disney on radar: Shares of Club name Disney dropped 3% on Friday, breaching the $100 level that Jim Cramer has in recent weeks identified as a favorable price to buy more stock. \"I am contemplating buying back some of the Disney we sold much higher when we are [not restricted] sometime next week,\" Jim said Friday. Jim's comments come as Wall Street is surveying the implications of Thursday night's presidential debate , which was widely seen as strengthening former President Donald Trump's chances of recapturing the White House in November. \"I know people might think that Disney is too 'woke' under a Trump regime, but I care more about how there could be a lot of M & A in media and Disney could benefit,\" he said. Future of the Fed: Cramer has been a vocal supporter of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the job he's been doing. However, he said Friday: \"Before you get too excited, remember, Powell is one of the first people to go. Trump has disliked him intensely even know he's his guy.\" Powell became Fed chairman in 2018 during the Trump presidency. But Trump almost immediately turned on Powell, lashing out at him in the fall of 2018 when the U.S. central bank started raising interest rates. His criticism continued during the final two years of his presidency . With much of the stock market discussion centered around what the Fed may or may not do, a change in Fed chair under Trump would likely shape rate policy in a different light. Solar praise: Analysts at Susquehanna offered upbeat commentary Friday on our newest stock: Nextracker , which joined the portfolio a day earlier . The firm initiated coverage of the maker of solar-tracking systems with a $59 price target and a buy-equivalent rating. While analysts were also positive on Nextracker competitor Array , they told clients they view the Club holding as a \"safer pick due to its leading market share, greater exposure to Tier 1 suppliers, geographic diversity, and cash generation.\" Nextracker shares traded around $47 each Friday, down more than 4% as the broader solar cohort came under pressure. The debate Thursday may be one driver of the selling. Trump is considered more favorable to the oil-and-gas industry, while President Joe Biden has championed clean-energy policies. Jim on Friday downplayed concerns that Nextracker would struggle in a hypothetical second Trump term. \"That's quite wrong,\" he said. \"Nextracker is industrial solar. Now, who wants industrial solar? The big mega caps \u2014 Microsoft and Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 because they are levered to commitments that they gave, not anything having to do with the president, for being carbon free, or at least reducing their [carbon] footprint.\" Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon also are Club holdings. As usual, we started with a small stake in Nextracker, at just a 0.5% weighting, which gives us room to add more shares over time. Our price target is $55 a share. Up next: On Friday evening, our two bank stocks, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley , may provide updated capital return programs after passing the Fed's annual stress tests earlier this week.

        "title": "How some venture capitalists are trying to lift the profile of LGBTQ+ founders",
        "body": "Raising capital remains an enduring obstacle for LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. Some venture capitalists are trying to change the equation and are backing minority founders to help them scale their companies and create jobs within their communities.\n\nAccording to LGBTQ+ entrepreneurship nonprofit StartOut, only 0.5% of the $2.1 trillion in startup funding between 2020 and 2022 was raised by LGBTQ+ founders, yet 7.2% of the U.S. population identifies as a member of the community, according to a 2022 Gallup survey.\n\nStartOut's State of LGBTQ+ Entrepreneurship Report, which aggregates data from internal research and sources like Crunchbase and Pitchbook, also found that 85% of funding is accumulated in only five metro areas: San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Denver and Austin, Texas. The largest cities that lack any LGBTQ+ founders are Orlando, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nStartOut CEO Brian Richardson told CNBC that jurisdictions with comprehensive nondiscrimination policies protecting LGBTQ+ people are the cities that have stronger benches of queer entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What we've been able to do through the limited datasets that we have is to start looking at and measuring how much cities and even states are losing out monetarily and employment-wise because they have anti-LGBTQ+ policies in place,\" Richardson said.\n\nResearchers at StartOut have examined the varying geographic impacts, weighing the economic effects that public policies have on entrepreneurial outcomes by comparing states that did and didn't pass the LGBTQ+-affirming policies between 2010 through 2020. They found that implementing state employee benefits coverage for transition-related care in Texas could create more than 121,000 jobs. Additionally, implementing hate crime laws for gender identity in North Carolina could attract as many as 17,000 founders, while a repeal of so-called \"Don't Say Gay or Trans\" laws in Alabama could add $10 billion in funding, they said.\n\n\"These numbers are really just the very first step of a much longer process to identify the challenges and to find the very best, most comprehensive, most effective solutions,\" Richardson said.\n\nOne organization trying such solutions is Chasing Rainbows, a venture capital fund that works with LGBTQ+ founders to connect them with capital. The fund currently invests in around 15 early-stage companies.\n\n\"We usually write [the] first checks for a lot of the companies, particularly from an institutional perspective,\" Ben Stokes, founding partner of Chasing Rainbows, told CNBC. \"We are very open to having conversations if someone doesn't have revenue; it's really just understanding the pathway that they have to get to that.\"\n\nChasing Rainbows takes a sector agnostic approach but focuses on four opportunity zones when considering a startup: sustainability, health care, education, and financial equity and inclusion. Stokes said the LGBTQ+ community historically has experienced some form of discrimination when trying to access these types of services.\n\n\"When a founder has experienced a problem themselves, they often know how to fix it,\" Stokes said. \"And they have creative solutions that are often done in a very financially savvy way.\"\n\nStartOut's report also found that despite operating on 16% less funding compared to the industry average, LGBTQ+ founders created 36% more jobs, 114% more patents and 44% more exits between 2000 to 2022.\n\n\"We work together to ensure that we are investing in new companies, that we believe that not only venture backers will [invest in] but will offer and deliver outsized returns for our investors,\" Stokes said.\n\nStokes said Chasing Rainbows advocates for resource allocations to consider founder diversity when selecting investments. State-level initiatives are already underway in Massachusetts and New York that would require VCs to include sexual orientation when considering capital allocation.\n\nIn California, Senate Bill No. 54 will require venture firms to report diversity statistics within their portfolios. That includes race, ethnicity, gender identity, veteran status, disability status and whether any member of the founding team identifies as LGBTQ+. The bill is scheduled to go into effect on March 1, 2025.\n\n\"This is going to be an amazing wake-up call for the industry,\" Stokes said, \"and particularly for limited partners, who are going in on the premise of the lead investors investing in diverse teams. Is it actually true?\"\n\nAn angel investor himself, Stokes founded Chasing Rainbows in 2021 after recognizing that underrepresented founders are seen as riskier investments. He credited his law professor at the University of California at Berkeley for giving him advice that led to his fund's approach.\n\n\"He said, 'Don't just be another underrepresented funder investing in underrepresented founders; be unique and be special in the industry because that's the only thing that's going to make you successful,'\" Stokes said.\n\nOn top of the limited amount of funding being funneled to LGBTQ+ innovators, Stokes said 75% of founders go back \"into the closet\" while fundraising on concern that being part of the community would taint their brand.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this has been evidenced by the fact that general partners and other funds who do have different religious or political views have openly discriminated against someone based on their sexuality,\" he said. \"What that means for them is that they're often code switching,\" referring to the practice of LGBTQ+ people deviating to more heteronormative language and behaviors.\n\n\"They will be scrubbing their LinkedIn, scrubbing all of their social media profiles,\" Stokes said, \"essentially going back into the closet and not being their authentic selves.\"\n\nBoth Stokes and Richardson were invited to the White House this past week to participate in a roundtable discussion on the hurdles that entrepreneurs face.\n\n\"Some of the challenges are obvious \u2014 access to capital is the biggest one,\" Stokes said. \"But we're looking at ways to partner with the government, in particular around grants and non-dilutive capital.\"\n\nRichardson hopes the attention will lead to broader support for organizations like Chasing Rainbows, and that additional funding for data and research will lead to greater representation and expanded economic opportunities for underrepresented innovators.\n\n\"We know that queer people and queer entrepreneurs continue to face barriers,\" Richardson said. \"But we also know that those barriers are especially steep for specific members of our community. We want to figure out and identify just how steep the barriers are and what individual members in our community continue to face.\"",

        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nOfficials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico \u2014 testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.\n\n\"We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,\" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.\n\nBefore launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.\n\nDespite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,\" Stich said.\n\nThe Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023. Irfan Khan | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nDuring an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

The majority of Americans surveyed, 81%, say they are dining out once a month or more and 31% say they dine out once a week or more, according to new research from e-commerce provider Lightspeed Commerce Inc . Even though inflation has slowed significantly from its pandemic-era peak, consumers still feeling the financial squeeze are opting for takeout, value meals and happy hour deals, the report found. The consumer price index, which gauges how fast prices are changing in the U.S. economy, shows food prices at restaurants have been growing faster than grocery store items \u2014 but finance experts have tips for stretching your dollar.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"While Americans are still dining out, they are also looking for ways to keep dining fun and affordable amidst changing economic conditions. It's all about value for diners \u2014 they're looking to enjoy eating out, but at a good price,\" Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva said. Lightspeed surveyed 1,500 Americans in May as part of an international survey that included 7,500 overall responses.\n\nHigher meal prices and 'shrinkflation'\n\nU.S. diners are noticing rising prices when the server drops off their bill, with 69% in the Lightspeed survey reporting pricier meals. Some said they're seeing \"shrinkflation\" in action, with 39% noticing their favorite dishes shrinking in size even as the prices remain the same or increase. Even with a jump in prices, about half of respondents said they will continue to dine out at the same rate or increase their frequency of restaurant visits. Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and CEO of oXYGen Financial Inc. in Atlanta, said consumer dining trends could be a lingering effect from the aftermath of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, 43% are hunting for deals with coupons, 39% are choosing value meals and 36% are taking advantage of happy hour specials.\n\nPast the 'tipping point of tipping'\n\nOne way consumers say inflation is impacting their dining habits is through tipping. Of those surveyed, 44% of consumers said inflation has affected their ability to tip. The majority of diners surveyed, 73%, say they're not happy when the cashier flips around a tablet screen to reveal auto-tipping options. \"I think when times were better, you definitely saw more people being more comfortable at the iPad paying tip,\" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Irvine, California-based Sun Group Wealth Partners. She is also a member of the CNBC Advisor Council. \"Nowadays, consumers are fed up with having to tip at places that they don't normally tip at,\" she added.\n\nWhen looking at scenarios outside of sit-down restaurants, consumers are more likely to tip delivery drivers (61%), than baristas at coffee shops (28%) or an employee working behind a counter (19%). \"People have passed the tipping point of tipping.

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nChina: 'Starkly different visions' of America\n\nChina's CGTN, the English-language service of state-run China Global Television Network, said: \"Biden started hesitantly and Trump answered steadily in a halting clash.\" Accusations of lies and that each of them was the worst-ever U.S. president, were rife, the outlet said. Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post said that the two \"presented starkly different visions for America's place in the world,\" and that it was a \"high-stakes debate.\" Before it kicked off, China's state-backed tabloid Global Times said it was expected to be \"like a reality show.\"\n\nIndia: 'Democrats in full-blown panic'\n\nThe Times of India led its story with concerns from Democrats about Biden's performance, with the headline reading: \"'We are f***ed': Democrats in full-blown panic over Joe Biden's debate performance.\" Biden \"delivered a shaky, halting performance,\" it said, while \"Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks.\" Elsewhere, India Today said Biden \"stammered and fumbled\" multiple times, while describing Trump's performance as \"forceful and aggressive.\"\n\nUK: 'Biden struggles ... Trump lies'\n\nIn the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: \"Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate.\" Many of Trump's replies to straightforward questions had little to do with the topic at hand, the paper said, and he made frequent false claims which were not fact-checked by the moderators. Biden, meanwhile, \"frequently struggled to complete his thoughts.\" The Times of London said that Biden's reelection campaign was \"plunged into crisis\" following the debate and that the current president's responses to questions were \"meandering and muddled,\" while Trump's were \"more assured and disciplined.\" Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump's attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: \"Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions.\" Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was \"marked by personal attacks.\"\n\nGermany: 'True losers ... are the Americans'\n\nGermany's broadcaster ZDF described the debate as \"more civilized\" but \"more charged\" than in 2020, adding that Trump had a better start, but Biden caught up later on, according to a CNBC translation. At first, Biden did not appear very agile and hesitated, it said, but added that his tone was \"somewhat surprisingly\" as aggressive and sharp as Trump's. On individual topics, Biden had \"clear words\" for Trump when it came to abortion, but things got \"uncomfortable\" for him on immigration \u2014 while Trump tried to dodge questions about the January 2021 Capitol Hill riot.\n\nSueddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, titled one of its stories: \"Joe Biden's bad evening,\" saying that even though his answers had more substance than Trump's, Biden's verbal stumbling raised concerns. In another story, the newspaper summarized the debate: \"Biden disgraces himself, Trump wastes his chance, but the true losers of the first TV debate in the U.S. election campaigns are the Americans.\"\n\nFrance: 'Uneven' performance",

He's got to get out now and if he doesn't get out we're going to get f------ crushed,\" said the advisor. They told CNBC they planned to approach Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday to discuss what happened at the debate.\n\n\"Game over,\" said a longtime Democratic campaign advisor, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden's 2020 White House bid.\n\nCNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.\n\n\"This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I'm speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,\" said the person, who was granted anonymity in order to recount private conversations.\n\n\"Disaster,\" said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with the president on Saturday in the Hamptons .\n\nMany of the Democratic Party's top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after President Joe Biden 's disappointing debate performance Thursday against Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nAn advisor of one of the Democratic Party's top megadonors called the debate an \"absolute train wreck\" for Biden. \"Worse than [Ronald] Reagan in '84 or [George W.] Bush in '04 or [Barack] Obama in '12,\" they added.\n\nThe problems for Biden at the debate started early. He stumbled out of the gate, appearing to lose his train of thought at times and pausing for a long moment before CNN moderators cut him off when he was discussing U.S. health care.\n\n\"Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the, with the Covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look ...\" Biden said, trailing off.\n\n\"Look, if, we've finally beat Medicare,\" Biden said, before CNN anchor and moderator Jack Tapper gently moved on. \"Thank you, President Biden,\" said Tapper.\n\nSeveral times later in the debate, the president repeated himself, or left several seconds of silence mid-answer. Throughout the evening, Biden's voice was raspy and quiet.\n\nBiden's campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News this was because the president had a cold. \"I think because of the way people analyze debates, it's going to be at first about the physical performance,\" said Landrieu.\n\nEven Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged that Biden was not in top form. \"Yes, it was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\" she said on CNN late Thursday.\n\nFor example, answering a question about border security \u2014 a top voter issue this election cycle \u2014 Biden's sentence was grammatically difficult to follow.\n\n\"I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump pounced on the stumbles. \"I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either,\" the former president quipped.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReplacing Biden on the ticket now would be extremely difficult, with less than two months until the Democratic National Convention in August. The president would effectively have to drop out of the race, leaving the decision about a nominee up to the delegates at the convention.\n\n\"It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden, I don't think there's any other way to slice it,\" Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director in the Biden administration until 2023, said on CNN.\n\n\"His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina \u2014 and he didn't do that,\" she said.",

The S&P 500 rose 68% during Trump's four years in office versus the 44% gain so far under Biden's administration. The Nasdaq jumped 137% during Trump's administration, compared with a 34% gain for Biden three and a half years into his four-year term.\n\nThe performance of the Federal Reserve is likely to be a big issue this election season as well as the debate over inflation, and what to do about it.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of the survey respondents said they trusted the central bank to do right by the American economy, but 23% said they didn't trust the Fed. Two-thirds said they believe the Fed will cut interest rates before the end of this year, but 23% disagreed, saying there'll be no cut in 2024. Ten percent of respondents said they would urge the Fed to cut at the next meeting on July 30-31.\n\nThe 400 money managers who took the survey were evenly split on where they stand on the direction of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. A third expect we'll have a 5% or more drop by autumn. A third said the markets will be up 5% or more by then. And another third said we're likely to remain range-bound.

        "body": "Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from \"political paralysis\" to \"immediate financial crisis.\" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.\n\nA complex system\n\nUnder France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff \u2014 a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using \"le vote utile\" \u2014 or tactical voting \u2014 to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be \"civil war\" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger \u2014 and therefore more representative \u2014 than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.\n\nMarket turmoil\n\nSuch a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a \"worse reputation globally,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs \u2014 a key indicator of French political risk \u2014 has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Spendthrift agendas\" from either party \u2014 whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax \u2014 could result in an \"immediate financial crisis,\" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently \"too optimistic\" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. \"Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,\" the analysts noted.\n\nPolitical paralysis\n\nThe CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella \u2014 Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally \u2014 was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement \"reasonable\" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would \"need an absolute majority to govern,\" in a bid to boost his backing. \"You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,\" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.",

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nA curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.\n\nSo, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.\n\nAnd it has been for the past year.\n\nThe price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.\n\nPoor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.\n\nTemperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.\n\nFood prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.\n\n\"The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,\" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. \"Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,\" he added.\n\nKeeping rates elevated, though, appears to be \"an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,\" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.\n\nThe anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.\n\n\"Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,\" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.\n\nThe government also has the option to remove import taxes \u2014 currently set at 40% on wheat \u2014 to hold prices down.\n\nYet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.\n\nLowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.\n\nFor now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.\n\nThere are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.\n\nBut, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.\n\n\"You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,\" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. \"[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.\"\n\n\"That's just the norm,\" he added.",

They don't want to sound overly complacent about the risks of inflation,\" Sheets said.\n\n\"But we think the data that the ECB will see by September is inflation [is] continuing to moderate. And I think, for the Fed, inflation is continuing to fall,\" he added.\n\nEuro zone inflation surprised to the upside in May, rising by 0.2 percentage point on a month-on-month basis to hit 2.6%. Fluctuations had been expected, due to base effects from the energy market and the unwinding of government support across the bloc.\n\nU.S. inflation, meanwhile, held steady in May but was up 3.3% from a year ago, the latest CPI data showed earlier this month. That was an improvement on the 0.1% monthly gain economists had expected.\n\nMarkets are now watching out for May's core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, due Friday morning.\n\nAnalysts expect the headline PCE to be flat from April and 2.6% higher on the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE is forecast to come in 0.1% higher month on month, which Sheets said was also in line with his expectations.\n\nA majority of economists polled by Reuters now anticipate the Fed will cut interest rates from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50% this September, with a further trim projected later in the year. The ECB is also expected to cut rates in September and December.",

It warned the levels were \"alarmingly high\" in a Thursday statement.\n\nAnything above 900 CFUs/100ml fails the Environment Agency's inland bathing water quality standards and is deemed a threat to public health, the campaign group said.\n\nMore than half (47%) of readings were found to be above the acceptable limit. The highest recorded was 25,000 CFUs/100ml, more than 27 times higher.\n\nRiver Action also found E.coli levels up to 10 times higher in March tests.\n\nJames Wallace, CEO of River Action, accused the government and Thames Water, which manages water supply in the area, of failing to appropriately manage water hygiene levels.\n\n\"This is a health emergency. The new government must get a grip of the water pollution crisis and ensure that water companies, including Thames Water, invest urgently in upgrading wastewater treatment plants and fix their leaky infrastructure before someone becomes seriously ill, or worse,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThames Water did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, though the BBC reported that it had dubbed the findings \"alarmist\" and said it was monitoring bacteria levels. CNBC also contacted the government's environment agency but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nChair of the Henley Royal Regatta committee of management and former Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave, said the findings were a \"stark reminder\" of the impact of sewage pollution.\n\n\"Our waterways are vitally important to our competitors racing, but also to all those athletes training on a daily basis nationwide,\" he said.\n\nRegatta organizers have advised rowers to cover all cuts and blisters and avoid swallowing river water as thousands of spectators descend on Henley on Thames for the event, which runs until Sunday.\n\nIt comes as the U.K. has faced a rise in E.coli cases. Two people with underlying health conditions died following infection with the Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli strain (STEC). One of the deaths is \"likely linked\" to their STEC infection, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\n\nThat particular strain is thought to have been spread via lettuce leaves within pre-packaged sandwiches.\n\nUKHSA said Thursday that 275 cases of the strain have been confirmed as of June 25, and urged people to watch out for symptoms which can include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever.",

(Photo by Ajay Aggarwal/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)\n\nIndian government bonds reached a major milestone on Friday with their inclusion in JPMorgan's emerging market government bond index.\n\nBut for some fixed-income investors it might be seen as more of a relief than an occasion to celebrate after a challenging few years for the asset class.\n\nTake the broad L&G India Government Bond exchange-traded fund, for instance. The index has a total return of 4.08% this year, but that's hiding the fact that these bonds have been underwater since their 2021 highs until May this year.\n\nAnticipating the Wall Street bank's decision, alongside Bloomberg's move to include India in a similar index next year, markets have partly pushed up bond prices in 2024 despite the risks of inflation reigniting.

        "body": "Younger, wealthy shoppers in Asia are splashing their cash on art, according to a longtime collector and senior auction house executive. Nicolas Chow, Sotheby's chairman for Asia, said more than 40% of its buyers of contemporary art are millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), while Gen X (1965 to 1980) are also likely to be big spenders, he said. \"The buyers are increasingly younger. What we've seen actually in 2023 \u2026 Gen X is the most important buy-base actually \u2014 over a million dollars, they dominate the market,\" Chow told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\" Gen Z \u2014 the youngest age group for buyers \u2014 is \"coming in quite strongly,\" he said, adding that he recently saw a 20-year-old buyer acquire a piece in Shanghai to celebrate his graduation. Wealthy millennials in Asia spent a median of $59,785 on art and antiques during the first half of 2023, while for Gen Zers the figure was $56,000, according to the Art Basel & UBS Survey of Global Collecting 2023. Buying at auction \u2014 instead of from a dealer, for example \u2014 is popular with millennials and Gen X collectors globally, according to the survey. The trend appears to be playing out in Asia. At Christie's Hong Kong spring season auction, held between May 25 and June 1, around a quarter of buyers were new to the auction house, and 43% of those were millennials, according to an online release.\n\nA visitor takes a selfie with work by Yoshitomo Nara during Sotheby's Hong Kong spring sales on April 2, 2024. Chen Yongnuo | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nAnd, while the size of the global art market fell 4% last year to around $65 billion, according to the Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report 2024, sales in China rose by 9% in 2023, overtaking the U.K. as the world's second-largest art market. \"Activity surged as post-lockdown buyers snapped up backlogged auction inventories and as Hong Kong's major fairs and exhibitions returned to full-scale programming,\" wrote report author and founder of Arts Economics, Clare McAndrew. For Sotheby's, the rise in younger buyers is driven in part by an increase in online activity. \"During the pandemic, we really sort of developed our digital abilities with live streaming ... And this has really brought in art to the greater communities and allowed us to engage with our buyers across the world,\" Chow said. Younger collectors are keen on newer art forms, with Gen Z collectors having the highest average expenditure on digital art globally \u2014 as well as prints \u2014 of any generation, according to the Survey of Global Collecting 2023.\n\nYoung digital artists\n\nFor Angelle Siyang-Le, director of the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong, artists who work in digital media are becoming more prominent. \"The definition of digital art nowadays has been expanded from simply photography to video art to NFTs to AI-generated art,\" she told CNBC's \"Art of Appreciation.\"\n\n\n\nAn NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain. Sales of art-related NFTs were $1.2 billion in 2023, less than half the $2.9 billion peak in 2021 \u2014 though still significantly higher than 2020 sales, which were $20 million, according to the Art Market Report 2024. \"With the younger generations becoming more and more prominent in the market ... digital artists ... will be the group of artists getting more attention,\" Siyang-Le added. Hong Kong-based artist Mak2 uses a variety of mediums in her work, including Instagram videos. Her 2017 work, \"You Better Watch Out,\" an inflatable, transparent \"snow globe,\" featured floating QR codes that the audience could scan. CCTV cameras filmed people scanning the codes, which linked to a web page that showed the audience looking at the artwork. \"So you are watching yourself being watched,\" Mak2 told CNBC's Art of Appreciation. \"You're not just looking at your phone, you're becom[ing] data circulat[ing] inside the app and being recorded and analyzed,\" she added.\n\nPeople view work at Art Basel Hong Kong, held in March 2024.

        "body": "Learning how to harness our attention is the \"skill of the century,\" says behavioral design expert Nir Eyal. D3sign | Moment | Getty Images\n\nInformation overload. From music and games to social media and endless hours of entertainment, easy access to technology has meant that humans are perpetually distracted. \"The cost of living in a world with so much abundance, the price of progress, is that we have to learn how to deal with all this information,\" according to Nir Eyal, best-selling author of \"Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life.\" \"The skill of the century is being able to harness your attention,\" Eyal, an expert in behavioral design, told CNBC Make It. \"It doesn't matter that you have the world's information at your fingertips ... if you can't sit down and focus on it long enough to actually turn that information to wisdom, then it might as well be garbage.\" Technology can be useful to humanity, but it can also be a distraction and lead to procrastination. In a world where technology is advancing at a breakneck pace, here are 4 principles to follow in order to become \"indistractable,\" according to Eyal.\n\nMaster your internal triggers\n\nWhen people feel bored, they check Instagram. When they're uncertain, they check Google. The action of being distracted is often preceded by a feeling of discomfort, or an \"internal trigger,\" says Eyal. To stay focused, people should first identify the feeling that precedes the distraction and create a plan of action for the next time that feeling comes knocking. People tend to blame their devices for distracting them from the task at hand, but studies show that humans are checking their phones due to a \"ping, ding or ring\" for only 10% of the time, said Eyal. The other 90% of the time, they are checking their devices due to an internal feeling \u2014 or to avoid pain or discomfort. Ultimately, devices are tools that carry no moral distinction. They are neither good, nor bad, but they can be used in productive or counterproductive ways. It is therefore important to learn how to harness the power of technology to serve us, instead of blaming it for distracting us from work and life.\n\nMake time for tasks\n\nIt is crucial to make time to perform the tasks at hand. \"If you don't have time for exercise, time with your family, time with your friends, time for focused work, it's not going to get done,\" Eyal told CNBC Make It. \"I used to believe [in] this to-do list myth,\" said Eyal, but this is \"one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity.\" While these lists provide the opportunity to unscramble thoughts and put goals on paper, it doesn't create the constraint that's necessary for prolonged productivity and focus. This method of planning is \"harmful,\" said Eyal, because without intentionally designating the time to perform the task, it can often end up taking longer than expected \u2014 or worse, set people up for failure. Instead, he suggests using a \"timebox calendar.\" It's a technique where instead of working on a task until it is complete, you set a fixed amount of time in your calendar for a particular task, according to Spica International, a workforce management software solution company. For example, a timebox calendar can look like this: 7-9 a.m. \u2014 Focused working time\n\n9-10 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast and get ready for the day\n\n10 a.m.-12 p.m. \u2014 Reply to emails and miscellaneous work\n\n12 -1 p.m. \u2014 Lunch\n\n1-3 p.m. \u2014 Work meetings\n\n3-5 p.m. \u2014 Focused work time\n\n5-6 p.m. \u2014 Reply to emails and plan for tomorrow\n\n6-7 p.m. \u2014 Exercise\n\n7-9 p.m. \u2014 Dinner and family time With a timebox calendar, \"the goal is not to finish anything, the goal is to work on a task without distraction,\" said Eyal. Not only does this help prevent procrastination, it can also prevent burnout by creating the dedicated time for other activities. It can help people prioritize their relationships, maintain their health, and overall, lead a more balanced life.\n\n'Hack back' the external triggers\n\nWhile people have become very reliant on devices, \"being dependent is not the same thing as being addicted,\" wrote Eyal in his book. Eyal suggested \"hacking back\" the external triggers on our devices, which is very quick and easy to do. They include purging apps that don't serve you, disabling notifications, as well as wearing a watch instead of looking at your phone to check the time. \"What's much more important that people don't talk about, are the meetings that didn't need to be called [and] the emails that didn't need to be sent,\" he added. Becoming pickier and more thoughtful with how we work can help prevent unnecessary time wasted.\n\nMake a pact",

        "body": "An aerial view shows a Philippines Navy vessel that has been grounded since 1999 to assert the nation's sovereignty over the Second Thomas Shoal, a remote South China Sea reef also claimed by China. Jay Directo | Afp | Getty Images\n\nChina has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. \"The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,\" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the Philippines and U.S. released new \"Bilateral Defense Guidelines ,\" reaffirming that an \"armed attack\" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing \" gray zone\" tactics \u2014 coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict \u2014 at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.\n\nU.S. 'gray zone' conundrum\n\nBeijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ \"gray zone\" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. \"The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,\" he said.\n\nGP: Philippine Coast Guard personnel ride a rubber boat past a Chinese Coast Guard vessel during a resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nAn expanded definition of an \"armed attack\" in the treaty could include \"any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,\" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,\" said Heydarian. \"It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,\" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.\n\nAmid a \"sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,\" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an \"armed attack,\" the country needs to \"do more\" than protest China's actions.\n\nA Chinese Coast Guard ship fires a water cannon at Unaizah May 4, a Philippine Navy chartered vessel, conducting a routine resupply mission to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, on March 05, 2024 in the South China Sea.

There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,\" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. \"Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,\" he added.\n\nwatch now",

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "title": "Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness",
        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

        "body": "A photo illustration of the Chewy logo is seen on a smartphone and a PC screen.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.\n\nChewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.\n\nThere's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\n\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\n\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\" McMillan told CNBC. \"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\"\n\nConsent required\n\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\n\n\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \"grand experiment in productivity,\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\" with clients, said McMillan. \"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\"\n\nThe broader vision",

        "title": "Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more",
        "body": "How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.\n\nVanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.\n\nThe good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.\n\nThe bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.\n\nThe takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.\n\nHigher returns, participation rates, savings rates\n\nWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.\n\nFirst, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.\n\nBut to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.\n\nOn those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"\n\nPlan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.\n\nThe result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.\n\nParticipant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.\n\nA few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:\n\nThey prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.\n\nThey don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. \"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.\n\nDespite gains in the market, account balances are still low\n\nIn 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.\n\nWhy such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.\n\nDistribution of account balances\n\nLess than $20,000 40%\n\n$20,000-$99,999 30%\n\n$100,000-$249,900 15%\n\n$250,000 + 15%\n\nSource: Vanguard\n\nMedian balances for those near retirement are still low\n\nA different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.\n\nInvestors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.\n\nA median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.\n\nOf course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.\n\nRegardless, the math does not look great\n\nSo let's do some retirement math.\n\nA typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.\n\nNext, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.\n\nFinally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.\n\nAccording to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).\n\nHere's our yearly retirement budget:\n\nPersonal savings $3,539\n\nPension $9,262\n\nSocial Security $20,264\n\nTotal: $33,065\n\nIt's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.\n\nEven then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.\n\nAnd these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.\n\nAnd that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.\n\nIn 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTo have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.\n\nOne issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.\n\nHowever, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.\n\nRegardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market.

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\n\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"",

Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters\n\nDALIAN, China \u2014 For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more \"applications\" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan \u2014 also known as the \"renminbi\" or \"RMB\" \u2014 in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's \"Summer Davos\" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. \"We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,\" she said. \"You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc.\" \"One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,\" Chan said, \"so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast year, the HKEX announced a \"Dual-Counter\" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, \"we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,\" Hu said. \"Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.\"\n\nA maturing financial market\n\nDeveloping more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term \"patient investing.\" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. \"Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,\" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.\n\nWaiting for more Chinese IPOs",

        "body": "Shapecharge | E+ | Getty Images\n\nWhy life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen\n\nMany Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has \"steadily\" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. \"It's a complex transaction,\" he said.\n\nThere are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, \"I do think there's a need for it,\" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.\n\nWhen to buy life insurance\n\nSupersizer | E+ | Getty Images\n\nConsumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. \"Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?\" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.\n\nWhat type of life insurance to buy\n\nThere are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.\n\nIt's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG\n\nIf a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires \u2014 perhaps at age 65 \u2014 the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.\n\nHow much life insurance to get\n\nLuca Sage | Digitalvision | Getty Images",

She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.\n\nThe pool began leaking air after just a few uses.\n\nFor Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool \u2014 and the disappointment that came with it \u2014 helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.\n\nAs Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.\n\nSam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.\n\n\"The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,\" he said in an interview. \"Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.\"\n\nThe success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.\n\nOvertaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"Never say never,\" he said. \"Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.\"\n\nBut he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.\n\nThe popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals.

        "body": "The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .\n\nThough the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Power.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.\n\nPreviously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.\n\nThe study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.\n\nAcross the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.\n\nOverall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.\n\n\"Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.\n\nThe study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.\n\nBEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.\n\nTop concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.\n\n\"It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\" Hanley said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\n\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \"high teens.\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \"R2\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\n\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\"\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\" Wentworth said. \"What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.\"\n\nHere's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\n63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nChinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.\n\nAlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. \"China is the industry's new disruptor \u2013 capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,\" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .\n\nModels presenting the Chinese automaker's electric car, the BYD Song MAX, at the 45th Bangkok International Motor Show 2024 in Nonthaburi Province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, on March 30, 2024.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters\n\nNASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called \"U.S. Deorbit Vehicle.\" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. \"It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,\" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to \"ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.\"\n\nSpaceX's Dragon crew capsule \"Endeavour\" seen from the International Space Station on May 2, 2024. NASA\n\nNASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. \u2013 along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan \u2013 has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.\n\nAging ISS\n\nBut the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. \"The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,\" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.",

        "body": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .\n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.\n\nLevi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\n\n16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.\n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.\n\n\"People are generally cautious,\" Singh told CNBC in an interview. \"It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\"\n\nWhile Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.\n\nLevi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.\n\n\"In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\" the company said.\n\nThe change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\"Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \"conservative\" view of the channel's growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.\n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.\n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.\n\nFor a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.\n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \"corrected\" that.\n\nRead the full earnings release here.",

        "title": "YouTube dominates streaming, forcing media companies to decide whether it's friend or foe",
        "body": "In this article GOOGL\n\nNFLX\n\nWBD\n\nDIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May \u2014 the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly \"The Gauge\" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. \"We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,\" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. \"Every [media] executive has to be paying attention.\" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV \u2014 an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others \u2014 even at times the same executives \u2014 view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube \"every day\" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. \"I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,\" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. \"When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,\" she said.\n\nYouTube's growing dominance\n\nGoogle's Tara Walpert Levy, now YouTube's vice president of Americas, speaks during a 2016 Advertising Week New York event, Sept. 28, 2016. John Lamparski | Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company \u2014 more than Disney and Comcast combined. \"YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,\" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.\n\nDisney's YouTube focus\n\nDisney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's \"The Gauge\" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.\n\nYou're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\" Brittany Broski YouTube creator\n\n\"I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,\" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as \"Bluey,\" \"Spidey and his Amazing Friends\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\"\n\nCartoon characters from the children's show \"Bluey\" are displayed during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 4, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\n\"At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,\" said Mayer. \"We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have.\" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series \"Disney Junior's Ariel,\" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of \"Winnie the Pooh\" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on \"Winnie the Pooh\" based on the short-form video data, the person said.\n\nNetflix's muted response\n\nNetflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. \"We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,\" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. \"Cocomelon,\" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. \"Cocomelon\" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and \"many more if you add in all languages,\" Mayer said. At the same time, \"Cocomelon\" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.\n\nPosters showing \"Blippi\" and \"Cocomelon\" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images\n\nThe more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.\n\nOther strategies\n\nComcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, scenes from \"The Office\" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a \"YouTube 1.0 strategy\" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. \"I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,\" said Nathanson. \"The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0.\" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack \u2014 pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, \"Beast Games,\" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a \"fast-paced and high-production format,\" as Amazon has promised.\n\nMrBeast accepts the Favorite Male Creator award onstage during the 2023 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, March 4, 2023. Monica Schipper | Getty Images\n\nMrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.\n\nYouTube's community\n\nThe popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. \"I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,\" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. \"You're betraying your audience,\" said Broski. \"You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\"\n\nBrittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nThe business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. \"Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?\" Broski said. \"You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?\" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. \"In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,\" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. \"With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.\"\n\nMichelle Khare at The 2023 Streamy Awards in Los Angeles, Aug. 27, 2023.

        "body": "In this article MANU Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Boeing 767 passenger aircraft of Delta Air Lines arrives from Dublin at JFK International Airport in New York as the Manhattan skyline looms in the background on Feb. 7, 2024. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty Images\n\nDelta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines \u2014 second to Delta in net profit margins \u2014 is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. \"Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,\" Bastian told CNBC.\n\nEd Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2022. Bastian said that he sees 'strong demand' for flights carrying into 2023. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDelta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. \"The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,\" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. \"We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. \"If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for.\" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead \u2014 if not drive \u2014 shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is \"part art\" and \"part science,\" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. \"Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,\" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards FactSet\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. \"They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,\" he said. \"And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nWhen the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. \"It was about building the operation brick by brick,\" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. \"It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand.\" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. \"One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,\" said Anderson. \"If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home.\" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. \"They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,\" he said. \"They have time to serve rather than to apologize.\" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.\n\nTime to remodel\n\nAfter Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. \"You had the liberty to start investing in premium,\" he said. \"You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers.\" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. \"I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,\" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. \"I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things.\" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.\n\nwatch now\n\nDelta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (\"It's proprietary,\" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, \"I must be in some third-world country.\" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a \"juniority benefit.\" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.\n\nLuxury air travel? In the U.S.?\n\nLuxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years \u2014 and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. \"Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,\" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year \u2014 which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate \u2014 after an uproar from customers.\n\n'We're constantly pushing each other\"\n\nBoth Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. \"Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.\n\nwatch now",

But we're not expecting a collapse either.\"\n\nGood for consumers\n\nSuch circumstances are largely good for consumers, some of whom have been waiting years to purchase a new vehicle amid unprecedented supplies of new vehicles and record prices during the coronavirus pandemic. But those circumstances are a headwind for automakers, many of which posted record profits due to the high demand and low availability of new vehicles during the global health crisis.

        "body": "Home prices set another record in April, even as mortgage rates rose and the supply of homes for sale increased. Usually, under those circumstances, prices would weaken, but today's housing market is unlike any other in recent history.\n\nPrices in April rose 6.3% compared with the year-earlier month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. It marks the second straight month that the national index jumped at least 1% over its previous all-time high.\n\nAlthough this is a three-month moving average, it's important to note that those price gains come even as the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped sharply in April, from 6.9% to 7.5%, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\n\"2024 is closely tracking the strong start observed last year, where March and April posted the largest rise seen prior to a slowdown in the summer and fall,\" said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a news release. \"Heading into summer, the market is at an all-time high, once again testing its resilience against the historically more active time of the year.\"\n\nThe only potential sign of relief is that the annual and monthly gains on the price index are slowing a little bit. March's annual gain was 6.5%.\n\nStill, it feeds into what is now one of the least affordable housing markets in U.S. history for both homeownership and renting. The housing cost burden has hit a record, according to a new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nHome prices are now 47% higher than they were in early 2020, with the median sale price now five times the median household income, according to the study.\n\nFor renters, even though rent growth is slowing due to a big increase in new apartment units this year, prices are still 26% higher than they were in 2020 and rising in three out of every five markets.\n\nHalf of all renter households \u2014 more than 22 million \u2014 spent more than 30% of their income on housing, which is considered \"cost burdened\" by HJCH. Twelve million of those households spend more than half their income on rent.\n\nFor homeowners, 20 million are considered cost burdened by their monthly payments.\n\nAll of those cost-burdened levels represent records.\n\nHomeowners are also facing a sharp increase in insurance premiums, up an average 21% between 2022 and 2023, according to the HJCH report, and property taxes are also rising.\n\nPrices continue to be supported by an imbalance in supply and demand. Housing supply was already low before the Covid pandemic hit, because homebuilders had yet to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Then there was a pandemic-induced run on housing, causing supply to drop to record lows for several years. Homebuilders couldn't keep up.\n\nSupply is now rising, with an 11% increase in new listings in April from March, according to Zillow, and a 16% increase from April 2023. That pushed total for-sale inventory up 18% year over year. While that might sound like a lot, supply is still quite lean, especially compared with the strong demand.\n\n\"The rapid and sudden increase in mortgage rates in April pushed housing affordability further out of reach for many potential buyers while some who could still afford held back,\" said Zillow's senior economist Orphe Divounguy in a release. \"As a result, the share of listings with a price cut shot up to 22.4% in April, the highest rate for April in the past six years, and a significant step up from 17.2% a year earlier.\"\n\nBut he added that despite the relative slowdown in April sales, homes that were priced well sold in just 13 days, only three days slower than in April 2023.\n\nIn May, inventory rose to a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.",

He then worked at Amazon as vice president of entertainment devices and services before his most recent role as chief product and technology officer for software development company Unity's Create.\n\nHis appointment comes at a crucial time for Cruise, which is testing and relaunching its autonomous vehicles on public roadways.

Kennedy International Airport is available to customers departing or arriving in the Delta One cabin, the airline's highest tier of service. It's the latest effort by a U.S. airline to win over top-paying customers. CNBC got a peek inside before opening day.

It also features a full bar and a terrace overlooking the airfield.\n\nLeslie Josephs | CNBC\n\nThe lounge, Delta's largest, is a step up from its more accessible Sky Club lounges, with new areas to relax. Travelers are offered complimentary spa treatments for the eyes, hands and arms and what it calls \"recovery remedy,\" a 10-minute shoulder, scalp and temple massage. There are eight shower suites complete with robes and slippers, and travelers can leave their clothes out to be steamed by staff within minutes, Delta says.\n\nAmenities in bathroom and shower stall at Delta One lounge at John F.

        "body": "Shein, the fast fashion giant with links to China, has confidentially filed for a public listing in London as it faces backlash in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.\n\nThe person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.\n\nThe company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.\n\nElected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.\n\nShein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.\n\nShein declined to comment to CNBC.\n\nReuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.\n\nShein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a \"global\" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company \u2014 and could exert control over its operations and data.\n\nShein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.\n\nAs Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.\n\nIt's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.\n\nShein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.\n\nIn May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public \u2014 a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.\n\nEven so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.\n\n\"Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,\" Donald Tang told the Journal. \"We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.\"\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.",

        "body": "In this article LEVI Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Levi's store at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets in Florida. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Levi Strauss, year to date",

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.\n\n\"Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,\" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. \"However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.\"\n\nThose comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.\n\nRecent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only \"modest further progress.\"\n\nBowman noted that there are \"a number of upside risks\" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.\n\n\"I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\" she said. \"Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nWhile that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% \"for some time.\"\n\nMoreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said \"it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.\"\n\nIn other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.\n\n\"With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,\" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nWhile Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.\n\nBoth officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.\n\n\"I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. \"We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.\"\n\nAlso, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees \"more months\" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.\n\nAs governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's\n\n\"dot plot\" grid of rate expectations as well as the Summary of Economic Projections.",

        "body": "Microsoft Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Artificial Intelligence Kevin Scott speaks at the Microsoft Briefing event at the Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\n\nThe debate over when the Federal Reserve will start to lower interest rates, and the persistence of the artificial intelligence frenzy, are the two key factors that have been influencing the U.S. stock market. Meanwhile, concerns about the course of the economy continue to affect investor sentiment.\n\nAgainst that uncertain backdrop, Wall Street analysts are focused on identifying stocks with solid fundamentals and strong long-term growth prospects. Investors can look at the recommendations of top analysts to gain useful insights before making any investment decision.\n\nIn that climate, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nWe start with Delta Air Lines (DAL), America's second-largest carrier. DAL reaches more than 290 destinations across six continents via 4,000 daily flights. Following the company's presentation at the Toronto Corporate Access Day recently held by TD Cowen, analyst Helane Becker reiterated a buy rating on DAL with a price target of $55.\n\nDelta is TD Cowen's 2024 Best Idea, Becker said, adding, \"Delta has a differentiated product in which they continue to invest, but what stands out is their strategic plan.\"\n\nBecker believes that management's focus on DAL's strategic plan for the past 15 years is delivering the desired results, making the stock attractive. Delta's stable management team is a key differentiator from its rivals, she said.\n\nBecker highlighted several strengths, including Delta's extensive network, strategic partnerships with other airlines and operational reliability, reflected in its improved net promoter scores over the past 10 years.\n\nThe analyst also noted Delta's commentary about continued strength in demand among premium customers (annual income of more than $100,000). Further, the carrier is seeing a solid rebound in corporate travel, with volumes rising by more than double digits on a year-over-year basis. Delta is also strengthening its financial position by continuing to reduce debt.\n\nBecker ranks No. 276 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. (See Delta Air Lines Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nMicrosoft\n\nOur next pick is software giant Microsoft (MSFT). The company, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of the generative AI (artificial intelligence) wave.\n\nRecently, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock and raised his price target to $550 from $475. The analyst believes that Microsoft is \"increasingly positioned to lead the AI revolution through the ongoing integration of generative AI functionality throughout its software stack and product portfolio.\"\n\nFeinseth noted that Microsoft's revenue growth of 17% in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31 was driven by the accelerated adoption of the company's AI-enabled offerings and AI cloud integration. The company's cloud business delivered robust performance, thanks to the demand for the Azure platform.\n\nFeinseth also highlighted Micrsoft's growing strength in gaming and efforts to expand into the Metaverse. Notably, MSFT's gaming business is expected to benefit from the $75 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition and the rollout of the new Xbox gaming console.\n\nFinally, Feinseth mentioned Microsoft's strong financial position, which supports enhanced shareholder returns and enables investments in the company's AI ambitions.\n\nFeinseth ranks No. 242 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.2%. (See Microsoft Technical Analysis on TipRanks)\n\nZscaler\n\nThis week's third stock is Zscaler (ZS), one of the leading cloud-based cybersecurity players. The company's Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform securely connects users, devices and applications by protecting them from cyberattacks and data loss.\n\nFollowing the Zenith Live 2024 event, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari reaffirmed a buy rating on Zscaler stock with a price target of $260. Discussing the key takeaways from the event, the analyst said that Zscaler is trying to capture additional market opportunities by expanding its platform.\n\nIn particular, Kothari noted the introduction of the Zscaler Identity Protection feature that capitalizes on advanced machine learning to strengthen identity security across cloud environments. He also mentioned the Cloud Browser Isolation offering that safeguards user devices and the DLP 2.0 solution, which has AI-driven capabilities to ensure the safety of sensitive data.\n\nThese new capabilities on Zscaler's platform have boosted its total addressable market by more than $24 billion to $96 billion. Kothari also emphasized the shift in the company's go-to-market strategy from a transactional focus to account-centric selling. Under the new sales approach, Zscaler is focusing on adding more customers with an ARR (annual recurring revenue) above $10 million.\n\n\"Impressive customer-success stories, particularly in the financial/healthcare/manufacturing sectors, underscore Zscaler's security-at-scale,\" said Kothari.\n\nKothari ranks No. 381 among more than 8,800 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.6%. (See Zscaler Financial Statements on TipRanks)",

        "title": "Starboard loses initial legal fight against Autodesk, but the battle may just be beginning",
        "body": "Business: Autodesk engages in three-dimensional (3D) design, engineering and entertainment technology solutions. Its product offerings are focused on the following categories: Architecture, Engineering and Construction, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, Manufacturing, and Media and Entertainment. Its products include AutoCAD Civil 3D, Building Connected, Autodesk Build, Revit, Computer-Aided Manufacturing Solutions, Fusion 360, ShotGrid and 3ds Max. Autodesk's product development and manufacturing software provides manufacturers in automotive, transportation, industrial machinery, consumer products and building product industries with comprehensive digital design, engineering, manufacturing and production solutions. It also offers Wonder Studio, which is a cloud-based 3D animation and VFX solution.\n\nActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. The firm has taken a total of 150 activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 24.83% versus 12.99% for the Russell 2000 over the same period. Starboard has had an even better track record in the information technology sector. In 53 prior engagements, it has a return of 36.43% versus 18.82% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.\n\nOn June 17 , Starboard sent a letter to Autodesk's shareholders announcing that it is filing a lawsuit to compel the company to delay its 2024 annual meeting, scheduled for July 16, and to reopen the director nomination window. This follows Autodesk's delayed disclosure of an internal investigation into reporting irregularities that Starboard says may have misled and possibly disenfranchised shareholders. The Delaware Chancery Court ruled against Starboard on June 20, but the activist still thinks that Autodesk requires board enhancement, as well as improved growth and profitability through operational performance, capital allocation policies and investor communications.\n\nAutodesk is a global leader in design, engineering and entertainment software solutions. About 75% of revenue is generated from Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) solutions. These are application areas in which Autodesk is the No. 1 or No. 2 player \u2014 where it generates significant recurring revenue and maintains pricing power. Its remaining revenue comes from its growing manufacturing applications (20%) and legacy applications in entertainment like movies and TV (5%).\n\nWith 90%+ gross margins and 35% operating margins, Autodesk is a leader in AEC software. The company's gross margins are best in class, a reflection of its value add and pricing power. Further, its operating margins are not much worse than those of its peers at first blush. However, Starboard correctly does not judge the company's operating margins on the mean of its peer set, but by the potential embodied in its gross margins and market position. Autodesk currently spends approximately 28% of its revenue on sales and marketing versus 23% for peers, and 9% on general and administrative expenses compared to 5% to 7% for peers. In other words, operating expenses as a percent of revenue is roughly 1,000 basis points higher than peers. Moreover, the company's FY2023 operating margins of 36% missed its own target of 38%, which was adjusted downward from an original target of 40% despite front-loading revenue through multiyear contracts. This engagement had great potential to be an excellent amicable and constructive activist campaign for Starboard. The firm has had great experience working with companies just like Autodesk from a board level to improve margins and create tremendous shareholder value. That would have been a great plan here and would have likely meant adding only two or three directors to the board.\n\nBut the cooperative, constructive scenario was seemingly dashed on April 1, when Autodesk publicly notified shareholders that its annual report would be submitted late following information being delivered to the audit committee, which resulted in the launch of an investigation regarding the company's free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices. Ultimately, the committee found that despite signaling to investors that it would be shifting its enterprise customers toward annual billing, Autodesk had recently pursued multi-year upfront contracts at levels that even exceeded their historical use, helping the company meet its FY23 free cash flow goal.\n\nTo make matters worse, the company informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of these issues by early March, but it withheld the information from investors until after the closure of its nomination window, preventing a potential activist director nomination this year. Despite this, Starboard said it reached out privately to offer to work with Autodesk to improve the board, but the company declined. So, Starboard requested that Autodesk reopen the nomination window so that shareholders could make a fully informed decision following the recent disclosures, given the fact pattern. The company rejected that offer. Starboard filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to compel Autodesk to delay its 2024 annual meeting set for July 16 and to reopen its nomination window, which closed on March 23. The court rejected Starboard's claim on June 20.\n\nWhile the findings of the investigation alone are worrisome, there are two things in our mind that could elevate it from an acute accounting issue to a much more serious governance issue. First, while Autodesk reports free cash flow as a key operational metric, it was also a factor in executive compensation. Second, how the board and management responded to this investigation might be an even bigger problem. Here, the board seemed to determine that Deborah Clifford could no longer remain as CFO. What happened next did not exactly inspire a strong feeling of board oversight and accountability: Instead of firing her, Autodesk appointed Clifford to the role of chief strategy officer. While the first issue reflects on management and its lack of alignment with shareholders, the second issue goes directly to the board's ability to oversee management and hold them accountable.\n\nIt is incontrovertible that these developments at Autodesk will require governance changes. The level of change that is necessary will not depend on the company's acts, but rather the level of involvement. Starboard does not know yet whether this situation can be rectified with a few board seats or a total board and management overhaul, but that will become clearer as more facts as to accountability come out. From our perspective, the company's response with respect to penalizing management and notifying and working with shareholders does not bode well for the \"minor change\" scenario. The governance issue is paramount here and must be addressed before Starboard can make any real economic changes directly enhancing shareholder value.\n\nOnce that is resolved, a reconstituted board and management team to the extent necessary can focus on improving operating margins and trading multiples. Improving margins by 1,000 basis points by itself could greatly increase shareholder value, but applying a bigger multiple to that will have an exponential effect. Presently, Autodesk trades at an EV/CY2025E earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiple of 19.4x versus some peers above 30x and a peer average of 23.5x. A good argument can be made that a market leader like Autodesk should trade at a higher-than-average multiple, but just getting to the peer average would be very meaningful for shareholders. This happens when shareholders have more confidence in the governance of the company \u2013 when the board offers more transparency, oversight and accountability \u2013 and when management hits its targets as opposed to missing and lowering them.\n\nWhether that happens will depend on several things. Starboard's loss in the Delaware Court takes the quick scenario off of the table. While there is a proposal on the proxy this year that would allow 25% of shareholders to call a special meeting, even if that is approved, the company can drag its feet on implementation so it would not really be useful prior to the next annual meeting. This might come down to how hard the board wants to dig in and how convincing Starboard and other shareholders can be. Otherwise, it will have to wait until 2025. The good news is that Starboard is an activist with the patience and conviction to wait until 2025. If it comes to that, the company's chances of winning would go down dramatically.\n\nOne final note: This is not the first time Autodesk has been engaged by an activist. Sachem Head had an activist campaign here between November 2015 and June 2017, and ultimately settled for three board seats and the appointment of a new CEO, Andrew Anagnost, who is currently at Autodesk's helm. It should be noted that one of the director designees pursuant to Sachem Head's agreement was Rick Hill, who has a very interesting relationship with Starboard. He was the chairman of Tessera when Starboard waged a proxy fight there. At the time, he fought the firm tooth and nail and was its most vocal opponent. Starboard ultimately replaced a majority of the board with Hill staying on and eventually becoming the firm's biggest supporter. Since then, he has served as its director designee at both Marvell Technology and Symantec. He no longer serves on the board of Autodesk, but he could certainly be an informal advisor to Starboard \u2013 or a cautionary tale for Autodesk.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",

Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.\n\nAs church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.\n\nBy sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.\n\nThe main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.\n\nHundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.\n\nPastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.\n\n\"I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,\" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.\n\nCalvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nThey have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.\n\n\"God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,\" said Kumar.\n\nPastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.\n\n\"God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.\n\n\"It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,\" said Kumar.\n\nMillions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?\n\n\"Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,\" said Kumar.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.**\n\nThat practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.\n\nNarayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring \u2013 all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.\n\n\"We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,\" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.\n\nNagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.\n\n\"Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,\" Mendem said. \"God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.\"\n\nShe and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.\n\n\"In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,\" Kumar said. \"We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.\"\n\nCalvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.\n\n\"The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,\" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.\n\nMembers also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements \u2013 again, all for free.\n\nIn 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.\n\n\"I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,\" Kumar said.\n\nEach member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.\n\n\"Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,\" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. \"They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.\"\n\nPastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.\n\n\"During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,\" Kumar told CBN News. \"Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.\"\n\nEach month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a \"Night with God\" as members pray for revival.\n\n\"About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.\n\n\"The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,\" Kumar said.\n\nMost attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.\n\nPastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.\n\n\"No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,\" said Kumar. \"It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It\u2019s OK to have penises in the women\u2019s swimming pool, in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m old; it\u2019s that your ideas are stupid.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\nMaher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to those people, you\u2019re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time \u2014 and they are \u2014 and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should keep the dialogue open,\u201d the HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host added.\n\nMaher recently appeared on the ABC talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.\n\n\u201cIf I had any doubt that I was right about the change that\u2019s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas \u2014 that straightened me out pretty quick,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to me that they can\u2019t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.\"\n\nTyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, \"This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state\u2014and the deep state\u2014accountable.\"\n\nThe Capitol Riot and Obstruction\n\nIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

        "body": "A last-minute peace deal could still possibly avert a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.\n\nBy the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.\n\nThat's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, \"Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.\"\n\nHezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.\n\n'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'\n\nAs the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.\n\nHe's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, \"On the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\nVisiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, \"The situation spirals out of control.\"\n\nExuberant Defiance of Terrorism\n\nEven as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.\n\nNimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.\n\nHe told the concert crowd, \u201cOn that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn\u2019t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.\"\n\nThe Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.\n\n'We Will Dance Again!'\n\nBut the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.\n\nAs concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, \"Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.\u201d\n\nNimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, \"In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\nREAD ISIS Network Helped 400 Cross US Border Illegally - Many of Them Are Now Missing\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "body": "ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming Fast\n\nThe hijab \u2014 the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women \u2014 is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.\n\nFor many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.\n\nChange is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.\n\nIt's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.\n\nThe raw emotion of the protests \u2014 including images of women publicly burning their hijabs \u2014 has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.\n\nExplosive Yearning\n\nThe protests, known as the \"Women, Life, Freedom Movement\", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.\n\nAnd the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.\n\nThe protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its \"morality police\" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.\n\nThis movement continues to gather momentum.\n\nIncreasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nThe change is not only social. It's religious, too.\n\nChristians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith \u2014 and those are just ones we know about.\n\nBut most Iranians don't see Christians as \"the enemy\" anymore.\n\nA generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.\n\nYet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.\n\nIllegal house churches \u2014 believers secretly meeting in homes \u2014 are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.\n\nA New Revolution\n\nBut new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's \"isolated\" believers.\n\nThey're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as T\u00fcrkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.\n\nThere's more to this new media revolution.\n\nSAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.\n\nSocial media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.\n\nA boy named Kaamran told us: \"The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.\"\n\nChange is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.\n\nIn fact, it's already here.\n\n--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and \"digital church\" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.\n\nThe official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.\n\nThe decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, \"This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.\"\n\nWATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban\n\nWhat the Case Is Really About\n\nThe Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.\n\nIdaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's \"health\" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.\n\nAnd the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent \"a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.\"\n\nDuring the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.\n\n\"One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,\" he said, \"is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'\"\n\nAlito pointed out, \"So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAbortion Leaks at the Supreme Court\n\nTwo years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\nThe Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.\n\n\n\nPro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, \"With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.\"",

        "body": "Human rights groups say 36,000 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the last two decades, including Mrs. Son, a former official of the North Korean military. During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.\n\n\n\nShe told CBN News, \"My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.\"\n\n\n\nIn order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.\n\n\n\n\"We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,\" Mrs. Son said.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.\n\n\"My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.\n\n\n\n\"Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.\"\n\n\n\nAfter yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.\n\n\n\n\"The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released\u2026 malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,\" Mrs. Son recounted.\n\n\n\nOnce in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.\n\nThe name of the church, \"Seopyoung\" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.\n\n\n\nRev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, \"It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.\"\n\n\"During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,\" he reports. \"Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.\"\n\n\n\nNorth Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.\n\n\n\n\"I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,\" Mrs. Son said.",

The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,\u201d said Nic of their experience together. \u201cBut nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe world can tell you so much about who you\u2019re \u2018supposed to be\u2019 based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might \u2026 make you feel included for a time.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the \u201clie\u201d of the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe whole world in the queer community was saying, \u2018Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'\u201d she recalled hearing. \u201c[But] that argument doesn\u2019t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, \u2018God made me this way,\u2019 then that means that I should have been a woman.\u201d\n\nLex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging \u2014 something she had not previously found in her family or faith.\n\nShe grew up in an abusive household \u2014 one that claimed to be \u201cChristian\u201d \u2014 with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, \u201cIf I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,\u201d a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.\n\nEvery time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would \u201creject me.\u201d Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.\n\n\u201cI ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to walk with you through this journey.\u2019 But all I faced was rejection.\u201d\n\nNic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, \u201cnever tried to change me,\u201d even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God\u2019s design for males and females.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.\u201d\n\nInitially, as a transgender male \u2014 meaning biologically female \u2014 and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.\n\nThey currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.\n\nThe couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn\u2019t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.\n\n\u201cThey chose to love us,\u201d Lex said of the church they attended. \u201cAnd that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.\u201d\n\nIn March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,\u201d Lex wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cHe is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, \u2018I do,\u2019 after Pastor Ivan said, \u2018Do you take her to be your bride.\u2019 Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic\u2019s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.\n\n\"Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,\" The Times reports.\n\nThe administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.\n\nMore than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.\n\nLATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children\n\nCritics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.\n\nBut as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that \"children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.\"\n\nMORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'\n\nWhen we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, \"The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nMeanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed \"weak evidence\" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.\n\n\"This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,\" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. \"In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.\"\n\nThere is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.\n\nNew rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.\n\nPerformance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.\n\n\"Which Joe Biden's going to show up?\" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. \"My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.\"\n\nNathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. \"Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,\" Gonzales explained. \"Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.\"\n\nBiden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions\u2014a first for a presidential candidate\u2014and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees.

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 There are media reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be about to abandon his opposition to a Palestinian state next to Israel. That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.\n\nAides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.\n\nYet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu \"opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.\"\n\nThe prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.\n\nItamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.\n\n\"There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,\" Marcus stated. \"There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th \u2013 and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres \u2013 and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.\"\n\nPreparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays\n\nOn another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.\n\nIn Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.\n\nGallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. \"The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,\" the defense minister said.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. \"We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,\" Fetterman declared.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, \"It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.\"\n\nAntisemitism in NYC\n\nIn New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, \"Raise your hands if you're a Zionist \u2013 this is your chance to get out!\"\n\nEarlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.\n\nOne protester said of Bragg, \"He's either a coward or an antisemite.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Better Medicine than Pills and Surgery, Doctor Says\n\nAmericans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.\n\nAfter watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.\n\n\"She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,\" Dr. Means told CBN News.\n\nDitching Mainstream Medicine\n\nAfter becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.\n\n\"What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.\n\n\"This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nShe explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.\n\nDiet Matters Most\n\nDr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take \"an ultra-aggressive stance on diet\" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.\n\n\"The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,\" Dr. Means said. \"Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.\"\n\nAfter nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,\" Dr. Means said.\n\nAvoid Processed Foods\n\nDr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,\" she said. \"Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.\"\n\nShe advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.\n\n\"We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,\" she said.\n\nDr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "How Astronaut Jose Hernandez Achieved a Dream That Seemed 'A Million Miles Away'",
        "body": "The true story of Jose Hernandez is out-of-this-world.\n\nAs a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.\n\nNow, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called \"A Million Miles Away.\"\n\nHernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.\n\n\"The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,\" he said.\n\n\"When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,\" he continued.\n\nHernandez described his personal path to perseverance.\n\n\"I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,\" he told CBN News.\n\nFaith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,\" he told CBN News.\n\nMany are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.\n\n\"It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,\" he said.\n\nAs a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.\n\n\"My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,\" he continued.\n\nAs Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.\n\n\"A Million Miles Away\" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.\n\n",

        "body": "Reports of stunning mass baptisms are coming out of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where one Christian leader revealed that more than 300,000 people have been baptized this year into the Christian faith.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.\n\nThe outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.\n\nThe effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.\n\nWilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.\n\n\u201cThe latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in \u2018PNG for Christ\u2019 with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.\u201d\n\nHe followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.\n\nWilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the \u201cHoly Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nJust days before Wilson\u2019s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.\n\nWith so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people \u2014 an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers\u2019 desire to express their faith.\n\nThe impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of \u201cdrug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.\u201d\n\nPNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.\n\n\u201cIt is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,\u201d he told the Adventist Record. \u201cI would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.\u201d\n\nBe sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.\n\nCBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.\n\n\n\nScars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.\n\n\n\n\"When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you \u2013 but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,\" said Pastor Bailey.\n\n\n\nThe first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.\n\n\n\nAfter 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.\n\nPastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.\n\n\n\n\"I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'\" Pastor Bailey recounted. \"And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.\"\n\n\n\nVolunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.\n\n\"They came in with resources that blew our minds,\" said Bailey. \"They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.\"\n\nStephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.\n\n\"I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,\" said Robinson. \"But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.\"\n\nDespite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.\n\n\"And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,\" said Robinson.\n\nPastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.\n\n\"But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,\" said Pastor Bailey. \"I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.\n\nThe Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.\n\n\"We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,\" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.\n\nScala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.\n\n\"For academics, we look at it based purely on data,\" Scala explained. \"So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.\n\n\"We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,\" Scala said.\n\nIn the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.\n\n\"We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,\" Scala said.\n\nThis is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn\u2019t use foul language,'\u201d Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump claimed he has been working \u201cso hard\u201d to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues \u2014 which often run between one and two hours \u2014 make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.\n\nHe requested Graham allow him \u201cone or two\u201d curse words, because \u201cif you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t get the emphasis.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nTo show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump said, \u201cI was really good. I didn\u2019t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.\u201d\n\nThe likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: \u201cWhen I see people start to walk out, then we\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to use the word bull****,\u201d Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad a word.\u201d\n\nAs for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.\n\nIn 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver \u2014 a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\u201cThese ten, from [Trump\u2019s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,\u201d Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cIt makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.\u201d\n\nNews of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThere are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,\u201d he said in a statement shared with CBN News. \u201cWe know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out \u2014 whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.\n\n\"Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,\" Austin said Tuesday. \"And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.\"\n\nStill, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,\" Austin stated.\n\nYoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.\n\n\"The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,\" Gallant insisted.\n\nIn Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.\n\nFormer Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. \"And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,\" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. \"The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy \u2013 and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,\" Lipman said.\n\nAnd in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive \u201cSquad\u201d lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman\u2019s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "He is the first former member of China's secret police to speak publicly about Beijing's active campaign to silence Chinese pro-democracy voices overseas.\n\nCalling himself 'Eric,' he was an agent for China's Ministry of Public Security or 'First Bureau,' from 2008 until last year, when he defected to Australia.\n\nHe told CBN News, \"My job was to collect intelligence about the country I was in and the anti-communist groups there. I was supposed to infiltrate these groups, make friends, and trap targets for return to China.\"\n\nEric was coerced into becoming an agent in 2008 after his arrest for supporting a pro-democracy party and given a choice: help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) catch dissidents abroad or go to jail. He chose the former, taking on fake identities, such as a property executive and an anti-communist freedom fighter, to lure dissidents to countries where they could be abducted and returned to China.\n\nBut because he secretly protected targets and says no one was arrested because of his work, his handlers became suspicious, and he decided to defect.\n\n\"I did not want to be responsible for any targets being returned to China and tried to make sure that did not happen, and this made my bosses suspicious of me,\" Eric said.\n\nEric's testimony confirms our reporting and the reports of others that a Chinese government spy network is threatening, entrapping, and even kidnapping critics of the Chinese communist government.\n\nCBN News Coverage: China Is Operating Illicit Police Stations Inside the US - Why Are They Still Allowed to Be Here?\n\n\"These are kind of the methods being used by the CCP. This is not an allegation we're making. This is what their official documents state,\" says Laura Harth, who tracks Chinese transnational repression for the human rights group Safeguard Defenders.\n\nCCP Agents like Eric are known to operate in the U.S., but Harth says these agents are only one part of a larger campaign by the Chinese government, called \"The United Front.\"\n\n\n\n\"The United Front is something that's being defined by the Chinese Communist Party as one of its 'secret' or 'magic' weapons. And essentially its task is two things: On the one hand, expand the circle of friends of the Chinese Communist Party. So, co-opting or influencing, politicians, media, academia, and entrepreneurs. But on the other hand, its task is also to crack down on critics, to silence them, to divide them.\"\n\nREAD China's Big Brother 'Social Credit System' Now Tracks People in North America Too with Video Surveillance\n\n\n\nAn Amnesty International survey of Chinese students in 24 universities in Europe and North America found that many live in fear of surveillance, harassment, or intimidation by Chinese agents.\n\nDissidents sent us photos of Chinese police paying visits to their relatives and warning them they face trouble and even jail if their family member doesn't stop criticizing the Chinese government.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear how many of the so-called Chinese police stations used to control dissidents are still operating in the U.S. On paper, it might be less than five. The one we reported about above a noodle shop in New York City was finally shut down by authorities.\n\nHarth says, \"It's important to recognize that police stations or so-called police stations is really the tip of the iceberg. It's much more widespread than one, two or three single stations. We need to take a broad view and understand what the wider picture looks like and the amount of proxies and networks that the Chinese Party-state is operating.\"\n\n\n\nBob Fu, founder and president of the Texas-based ministry China Aid helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student. He still faces harassment by Chinese agents, 35 years later.\n\n\n\nFu told CBN News, \"In recent months, even I have been harassed and receiving threats, text messages and also CCP agents booked hotels under my name and then called the police, from New York to Los Angeles, from Washington, D.C. to Houston, basically for bomb threats, and said 'Bob Fu was about to set off bombs.'\"\n\nMUST SEE 'The Perfect Police State': China's Digital Dictatorship Goes Global\n\n\n\nPro-democracy activist Lijian Jie in Los Angeles, who Chinese agents have tried to kill three times, told us Chinese-Americans are \"still surrounded by constant threats of danger.\"\n\n\n\nIn a special message to his former colleagues still trying to harass and trap Chinese dissidents, Eric encouraged them to \"recognize the nature of the communist party,\" that \"it is a fascist totalitarian party,\" and that \"carrying out these illegal and secret activities in various countries is not good for you.\" He challenges them to instead \"do something good for human civilization.\"\n\n\n\nBeijing's continued repression of overseas Chinese begs the question, if those Chinese who have fled communism for freedom still live in fear of the Chinese Communist Party, are they really free?\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "4 expert-recommended supplements to boost your energy",
        "body": "The heat wave gripping much of the country can be a serious energy sapper. But so can a slew of other culprits, from lack of sleep and poor diet to depression, anemia, stress, thyroid issues, and even lack of exercise. And sometimes caffeine just doesn\u2019t do the trick (not to mention that drinking too much can cause ill effects from increased heart rate to dizziness and anxiety).\n\nSo what about vitamins and supplements to help boost your energy? There are a few that experts swear by.\n\nBut first, a few caveats.\n\n\u201cIf someone is dealing with low energy, my initial response would be to recommend a series of tests before considering supplements,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth Sharp, internist and medical director at Health Meets Wellness in New York City, tells Fortune. \u201cTesting for vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamin D and vitamin B12, especially in vegetarians, is crucial. Additionally, I would screen for thyroid disorders if other symptoms suggest such a condition, and I would also rule out anemia and iron deficiency. It\u2019s important to identify the underlying cause accurately to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.\u201d\n\nOnce they are determined to be appropriate, she says, be cautious when making your purchase. \u201cBe wary of supplements that are far cheaper than the rest or look like a good deal,\u201d Jolene Brighten, naturopathic endocrinologist and author of Is This Normal?, warns. \u201cOften these are using poor quality ingredients and in some cases, because they are not regulated, they won\u2019t actually have what the label lists.\u201d\n\nTo help avoid such risks, suggests Cathi Dennehy, a doctor of pharmacy, dietary supplement researcher, and professor at the University of California San Francisco, start by speaking with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian who is well-versed in supplements. Then, when you\u2019re ready to buy, be sure to do some research, especially on the brand.\n\nConsumers may want to consult the National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements] as well as subscription-based sources, such as Consumer Lab, which charges a fee for access to its test results, which looks into everything from possible contaminants to making sure a supplement contains what it claims to. \u201cA question that I get asked fairly frequently is, \u2018Is this brand that I\u2019m taking a good brand?\u2019\u201d says Dennehy, who points to these sources for answers.\n\nFinally, she says, when deciding which vitamins and supplements could help with energy: \u201cThis is my take on it: If you\u2019re deficient in it, then correcting can be helpful. But if you\u2019re not deficient in it, then it\u2019s not likely to be helpful.\u201d\n\nAll of that said, below are four favorites to consider.\n\n1. Vitamin B12\n\nA nutrient that helps keep our body\u2019s blood and nerve cells healthy and while also helping to make DNA, the genetic material in all of our cells, vitamin B12 also helps prevent megaloblastic anemia, a blood condition that makes people tired and weak, according to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. It\u2019s why it\u2019s often a solid go-to for people lacking energy, as long as there\u2019s evidence of a deficiency.\n\n\u201cThere are certain vitamins that we know to be more likely to be associated with deficiency in the general population. And about 15% of the population is deficient in B-12. So that\u2019s something that you could test for,\u201d says Dennehy. She adds that certain populations are more likely to be deficient\u2014including vegans, because B-12 is bound to animal protein in food; folks with an autoimmune disorder called pernicious anemia, who are unable to absorb the vitamin; and people who take a lot of over-the-counter stomach-acid reducers, like famotidine, because they don\u2019t have the stomach acid to release the B-12 from the animal protein.\n\nBut, warns Brighten, \u201cBe cautious taking these in the late afternoon or evening since they can interfere with sleep in some people.\u201d\n\nAnd, once again, says Dennehy, \u201cthe only reason it would improve energy would be if you\u2019re correcting a deficiency.\u201d\n\n2. Vitamin D\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, some of the top symptoms of vitamin D deficiency in adults are fatigue, muscle weakness and low mood, which can lead to feeling down and exhausted. So does it make sense that supplementing the vitamin could add some pep in your step?\n\nPossibly. A study published in the journal Medicine compared the results of two groups with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency\u2014one of which was given vitamin D supplements, the other a placebo. In just four weeks, the group given vitamin D experienced significant improvements in energy levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get the vitamin D you need from your diet; oily fish and fortified dairy products are the only important sources,\u201d notes a Harvard newsletter on supplements. \u201cSo supplements do make good sense for most adults.\n\n\u201cVitamin D is beneficial during the winter,\u201d says Sharp, \u201cwith 1,000 to 2,000 IU daily being safe for most people.\u201d Brighten adds that \u201cit is also important to be getting enough sunlight,\u201d and suggests testing D levels to determine what you need.\n\n3. Creatine\n\nCreatine is a compound made in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas\u2014and found naturally in foods such as red meat and fish. It\u2019s primarily stored in your muscles in the form of phosphocreatine, which is \u201cthe initial energy source for all exercise and the preferred source for \u2018explosive\u2019 movements such as lifting heavy objects, jumping, and short sprints. As such, creatine monohydrate supplements are widely used to increase strength performance,\u201d according to the Department of Defense Dietary Supplement Resource.\n\nAnd unlike some other supplements, says Dennehy, \u201cThat one actually has some decent evidence for being beneficial for someone who does, let\u2019s say, high-intensity exercise.\u201d The International Society of Sports Nutrition, she adds, has a favorable stance on creatine, as does the Natural Medicines Database. \u201cIt seems to improve that maximal, intense-exercise output.\u201d So creatine\u2014available in powder, capsule or gummy form\u2014 makes sense, she says, \u201cif you\u2019re someone who\u2019s doing a lot of heavy athletic activity.\u201d\n\nBrighten agrees, noting, \u201cCreatine is a very well studied supplement that offers both brain and muscle health benefits. In addition, it can help your cells generate a molecule called ATP, which is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell. Creatine can help improve your workouts, which can result in you feeling more energetic and getting better sleep.\u201d\n\n4. Iron\n\n\u201cAgain, it would make sense if you\u2019re deficient in iron,\u201d says Dennehy. \u201cAnd like the World Health Organization notes, iron deficiency is common worldwide. About 30% of the world has a more severe form of iron deficiency anemia, and we know iron deficiency anemia can result in tiredness and fatigue and weakness, and decreased immunity. So this is where you would want to have your kind of lab work done.\u201d\n\nBecause excess iron, on the other hand, can be toxic to the body, she says.\n\nBrighten adds, \u201cOutside of patients who are regularly menstruating, pregnant, or who have confirmed iron deficiency anemia, we don\u2019t typically recommend iron supplementation because it can have negative effects on your health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can cause gastrointestinal issues if not needed,\u201d warns Sharp.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nFinally, two bonus supplements to consider include beetroot powder, which Brighten says \u201cis rich in nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide, which leads to increased blood flow and delivering oxygen to your tissues, which can result in more energy,\u201d and magnesium. That, she says, \u201cis a mineral that a lot of people benefit from and can help with energy levels by improving sleep. Additionally, magnesium is required for the metabolism of foods, which is how we obtain energy, and in regulating our blood sugar, which helps us maintain energy.\u201d\n\nMore on supplements:",

In 2016 Julia took the reins, just in time to take the company public before she and her team were slammed into the crisis that was the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile Hartz held the top job that fateful March, she told Fortune titles went out the window as the team pulled together to keep the business above water. For Hartz, that meant making some tough decisions on how many staff the company needed to survive\u2014for her husband it meant dropping his full-time job as an investor and working alongside his wife to keep the company on track.\n\nBut four years later the company\u2014built on gathering people in person\u2014has not only survived social distancing and lockdowns, but is flourishing. Indeed, as consumers have rediscovered in-person socializing a new frontier has opened up for Eventbrite: niche hobbies which might even allow visitors to make some romantic connections.\n\nSpeaking to Fortune, Hartz reflected on the \u201cexciting but deeply disturbing\u201d experience of being one of the only female founder-CEOs to have launched her business on the New York Stock Exchange, and how the pandemic forced her to get past any shred imposter syndrome she might have felt.\n\nA dark room with no oxygen\n\nAt first, Hartz told Fortune in a video interview, she judged herself on \u201cAm I doing it right? What would Kevin do?\u201d Then, \u201cthat line of questioning and self-doubt went out the window when COVID happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine getting stuck in a room that has very little oxygen and every single light goes out, to the point it\u2019s an utter void of darkness. That was like the first two weeks of COVID,\u201d recalled Hartz, who has been named on Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women list. \u201cThe entire basis of our business evaporated and no one in their right mind could have predicted that. We do all this scenario planning, disaster planning, tabletop exercises\u2014there never once was a scenario when a global pandemic hits and people aren\u2019t actually allowed to gather in a place like the United States.\n\n\u201cIn order to get out of that room\u2014that dark room\u2014I had to go on instinct completely. I had to do things that rationally I would never ever imagine doing, and I made a bunch of micro mistakes but the things I got right were really critical. Which was to move quickly, to not let it play out and see what happened, and that meant making a lot of tough decisions.\u201d\n\nThat included axing half of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014around 450 people\u2014and hitting the (metaphorical) road to drum up some fresh financing.\n\nWith a massive overhaul came the opportunity to rebuild the company with added experience, so Hartz and her senior executive team drew up a one-page draft of how they wanted the reset to go.\n\n\u201cWe were dividing conquering and I realized after being in a month of crisis mode that I had forgotten to have a moment of doubt. And I was like \u2018Oh, that\u2019s handy I should keep doing this,'\u201d Hartz recalled. \u201cI remember laying on the ground of our home office just thinking \u2018If I live through this I\u2019m never going to waste time feeling a lack of confidence.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile an ideas overhaul reshaped the company, one decisive factor stayed the same: parity. From the offset Eventbrite wanted the company to \u201clook like the world\u201d and to have a 50/50 gender balance, with Hartz describing her cofounders as \u201cincredible feminists.\u201d\n\nAnd that hasn\u2019t changed\u2014in 2018 the the Eventbrite board reached 50/50 parity and in 2024 the idea that you have to \u201csee it to be it\u201d is still core to the business.\n\nHartz explained: \u201cIt\u2019s come about very organically. I think if you have that North Star that guides you to build a company that is treating everyone well, gives everybody a place, and never makes anybody look over their shoulder and think: \u2018Should I be here?\u2019 then you\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nFifth family member\n\nWhile 18 is the age many parents see their kids as grown up and independent, near-two decades in business is no guarantee that its founders can take their eyes off the ball.\n\nFor Hartz\u2019s daughters, Eventbrite has become something of a commercial sibling they grew up alongside, understanding that when their parents needed to focus on the business it has been for their family.\n\nDuring COVID Kevin and Julia were working 20 hours a day, with their home becoming a \u201cvillage\u201d of people who pitched in to help.\n\n\u201cI have these sweet photos Kevin took of our daughters sleeping on the couch in our office. It was reminiscent of when we started the company and they were a part of that journey as well,\u201d Hartz said. \u201cDuring that time the girls would serve us dinner\u2014they\u2019d come in dressed as waiters and do little skits and sing songs. I think they knew that levity was really important. I think there\u2019s something really special about having this company be a member of the family in terms of what we prioritize and I hope that they have really fond memories of it.\u201d\n\nThat \u201csweet intimacy\u201d in a \u201ccold, scary time of unknown\u201d also echoed through to Hartz\u2019s relationship with her husband\u2014not only as a life partner, but as a co-founder.\n\nFor many, a life partner setting up massive gaming-style screens in your home office may not scream charm but for Hartz it was \u201cthe most romantic gesture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just melted because in one gesture he showed me he was going to drop everything and be a co-founder. It didn\u2019t matter what our titles were, we were going to be side by side. We were shoulder to shoulder for a month making some really difficult decisions\u2014when you\u2019re founders it\u2019s not unlike being parents,\u201d Hartz added.\n\nEventbrite\u2019s new era\n\nWith the pandemic in the rearview, Eventbrite\u2014which has recently increased its engineering footprint in India with gender equity throughout its ranks\u2014and its customers alike are focussed on what\u2019s next. For consumers that entails exploring their niche interests and meeting new people, be it friends or romantic interests.\n\nA recent data capture of people using the Eventbrite platform found that dating and singles events were on the rise \u201cmassively\u201d\u2014up three to four-fold. And that doesn\u2019t entail more stereotypical events like speed dating or mixers, it\u2019s happening around activities like classes or hobbies.\n\nIndeed, women in Eventbrite\u2019s survey group said they would prefer to meet someone at a cooking class as opposed to out at a bar.\n\nHartz added: \u201cI find it so sweet and charming when you think about the dynamic of wanting to get outside of this swiping and algorithmic, programmed matching\u2026 to actually being somewhere, doing something you love to do and actually meeting someone through that experience.\u201d\n\nAs well as romantic events, sober get togethers are also rising in popularity\u2014even down to reading groups where people are encouraged not to discuss the book, but simply enjoy their novel in silence.\n\nAnd\u2014in a year of Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and the Euros football tournament\u2014there\u2019s also plenty of fans looking to enjoy events together.\n\n\u201cWe tracked almost 200 Euro viewing parties that already had more sign-ups than the capacity of the first stadium,\u201d Hartz said. \u201c[People were also] doing all sorts of Taylor Swift-themed programming and official non-ticketed events. The vibrancy of events is incredibly high, the creativity is incredibly high, people want to go out and do something that\u2019s unique. That\u2019s propelled by social media, by discovering great events and wanting to share you\u2019ve been somewhere unique that matches your niche interests.\u201d",

        "title": "Hinge CMO on fighting the loneliness crisis and Gen Z's exhaustion with dating apps",
        "body": "A vast majority of Gen Z\u201479%\u2014feel emotionally, mentally, or physically exhausted from using dating apps, according to a survey from Forbes Health this year. \u2018Dating app fatigue\u2019 is a vicious cycle: Hopeful romantics rely on their phones to help them find love, but they\u2019re also burned out by the experience.\n\nThe loneliness epidemic\u2014which technology helped fuel and is also trying to solve\u2014is at the top of Hinge CMO Jackie Jantos\u2019s mind. She recognizes that her core Gen Z audience lacks authentic connections but knows they define community as engaging in person with people with similar interests and values. She is focusing the marketing effort on pushing users toward connection and investing in solving the loneliness epidemic through social impact outside of the app itself.\n\n\u201cWe know that you can\u2019t date well if you\u2019re not feeling well, so we started digging into what was happening there,\u201d she says.\n\nFortune virtually sat down with Jantos to learn more about Hinge\u2019s \u201cOne More Hour\u201d initiative and the app\u2019s role in addressing the loneliness epidemic.\n\nThe interview has been edited for clarity when necessary.\n\nFortune: What is your research and data showing us about dating, loneliness, and Gen Z today?\n\nJackie Jantos: Our research found that over 80% of Gen Z feel lonely. There are a variety of places they turn when they\u2019re feeling this way, from social media to online entertainment. And in reality, they are spending 1,000 fewer hours in person.\n\nFor us, the focus is on how we bring people together and encourage them to return to in-person connections. What are the ways that we can support the social groups and organizations that are trying to do that work? And how do we combat some of the barriers that are holding people back from in-person gatherings?\n\nFortune: And how are you doing this?\n\nJantos: Our organization and app are very focused on getting people off the app and into real dates. We actually measure great dates, and it\u2019s the core metric that we look at. Getting people to connect in person is really critical to building relationships and to the work that we\u2019re always trying to do.\n\nFortune: With Gen Z as your core audience, how do you ensure Hinge is not contributing to their loneliness\u2014or serving as another barrier to in-person connection?\n\nJantos: Hinge as an app is very different from others. It\u2019s much more focused on slow onboarding and helping you really articulate what you\u2019re looking for at a pace that is more comfortable for you. If you look at some of the recent product work that we\u2019ve put out there, we\u2019ve put out things like \u2018your term limits,\u2019 which is a feature we were testing and launched a couple of weeks ago. The goal is to encourage people to focus on a few great conversations versus sitting on many interactions on the app at any given time.\n\nMost of what we\u2019re doing is trying to help people navigate this experience. We do this by articulating what they\u2019re looking for really clearly, connecting them with relevant matches, and helping them focus on higher-quality conversations with those matches. All that is in service of getting them off the app and into great dates faster.\n\nIf we don\u2019t encourage people to meet in person, they\u2019ll continue to spend more time online than in person. It is not about how often you engage on the app but how seamlessly you get off the app.\n\nFortune: How has your role as CMO changed throughout your time at Hinge?\n\nJantos: When I think about brand marketing, it has historically been about expressing the values of your organization and your brand to the world to encourage people to feel connected to it. Particularly when engaging with the Gen Z audience, the tangible activities of the brand and the business more tangibly connect to their understanding of your brand\u2019s values.\n\nOur social impact work right now is focused not just on romantic relationships but also on helping Gen Z more easily connect in person with each other. We\u2019re really focusing on that social impact activity to bring more energy and conversation around this topic to life.\n\nFortune: What is Hinge\u2019s One More Hour initiative?\n\nJantos: One More Hour is a program that we launched in December, and we launched it with a million-dollar fund that was essentially a call to action, a call to individuals or groups organizing social clubs where people can come together in person and engage in some sort of activity. Affordability is a big part of what we were looking for as well. And this month, we had just over 200 applications for the One More Hour grant. We have awarded an inaugural cohort of 40 social clubs, and so the response has really been overwhelming. We\u2019ve been working with Gen Z organizations and our own Gen Z advisory council to advise us along the way.\n\nFortune: What have you noticed about the evolving nature of dating apps and how people engage with Hinge?\n\nJantos: In the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been growing at an incredible pace with Gen Z. This is an audience that does not mince words when they talk about how they feel about brands, and they\u2019re looking for services that meet their needs. What\u2019s unique about this audience is they are looking for meaningful connections. They\u2019re looking for ways to find that. They\u2019re just at the beginning of being able to recognize the value of connecting in person, and that is the crux of the conversation.\n\nWe\u2019re coming of age in a period when the development of identity and how you connect with one another are critical aspects of growing and understanding what sort of relationships you want to be in and how you want to show up in a relationship.\n\nThere are many ways that brands, particularly brands serving Gen Z, can donate their money, resources, and talent to great causes with organizations that are also trying to serve Gen Z. So, for me, social impact is really critical to growing a sustainable, long-term business and to supporting the audience you\u2019re aiming to serve.\n\nFortune: What do you see as the future of Hinge\u2019s role in the larger loneliness epidemic?\n\nJantos: We know that you can\u2019t date well if you\u2019re not feeling well, so we started digging into what was happening there. A year or so later, the U.S. Surgeon General announced the advisory on the loneliness epidemic, which came as no surprise to us.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to know that people, particularly younger generations, have access to so much information, very openly share their views, and read the views of others.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising to us when we then influence the development of the product itself and launch features like hidden words, which went out quite recently, where you can essentially block words from incoming likes to have a more curated experience on Hinge. Term limits help tighten the quality of matches and conversations happening on hinge.\n\nFortune: Are there any features on the horizon we should look out for?\n\nJantos: We have a lot in the hopper right now that will come out in the second half of this year. So, there is more to come that I can\u2019t speak to right now. But absolutely. Product features in development right now are in accordance with the organization\u2019s values and how we hope to serve this group of young adults better.",

        "title": "How to survive Paris during the 2024 Olympics",
        "body": "The most anticipated sporting event is only a month away\u2014and it happens to be in the most visited city in the world: Paris.\n\nAside from the picturesque streets, fragrant cafes, and stray cyclists, the French capital will also be swarming with spectators\u2014over 15 million are just arriving for the Paris Games.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to locals and other French residents traveling to the capital from different parts of the country.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Paris can be a lot. Recently, the city has grappled with a bed bug outbreak, dengue scares, petty crime, public transport workers\u2019 strikes, and more.\n\nGiven the twin popularity of the Olympics and Paris, surviving (and thriving) in the city can feel like hard work. Although Paris got a feel for managing big crowds that flocked to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concerts earlier this year, the Olympics and Paralympics will have the city buzzing with activity over an extended period.\n\nBut fret not\u2014Fortune spoke to tourism, insurance, banking, and culture experts for their tips on navigating the city and having a great experience.\n\nGetting around\n\nPassengers at a metro station in Paris. Jan Woitas\u2014picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nLike its other big city peers, Paris has an infamous traffic problem. In the lead-up to the Olympics, several hotspots in the city will be cordoned off, restricting taxi access.\n\n\u201cThe biggest pitfall is going to be the traffic. It will be very hard to find your way around it, which is why being centrally located at a perfect hotel is the key,\u201d said Jonathan Alder, founder of travel management company Jonathan\u2019s Travels.\n\n\u201cThis level of crowds is going to be a challenge for Paris, specifically when it comes to traffic and crowding. For guests willing to pay for the top hospitality packages, they have created a workaround with a special traffic lane that will only be available to specific vehicles,\u201d Alder told Fortune.\n\nIf you plan to visit other parts of France before getting to Paris, he cautions against connecting via a major Paris airport\u2014whether Charles de Gaulle Airport or Paris-Orly.\n\nWhile cabs (identifiable with a \u201ctaxi\u201d sign on their hoods) are very much an option, public transport is still the best way to get around the city. Road and station closures could hamper some routes, so the RATP and Public Transport Paris 2024 apps will be your friends for real-time updates on what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Also, keep your eyes and ears open in case of any protests in the areas you\u2019re heading to. Don\u2019t forget to leave enough buffer time for delays.\n\nOther safe alternatives include carpooling, renting cycles (a V\u00e9lib pass could be helpful), and exploring areas by foot.\n\nUber is offering free ferries across the Seine River from July 12 to August 3 in addition to taxis.\n\nBeware of your Euros\n\nIt\u2019s good to keep some (but not too many) Euros in hand. Andrzej Rostek\u2014Getty Images\n\nWhen in Paris, beware of how and where you access your money. Tourists habitually convert local currencies to their home currency to find the best deals in shopping and buying food. The implication? Exchange rates change daily, even if only by a small percentage, and it costs to use your home currency if you aren\u2019t careful.\n\nAlways have some (but not a lot) euros handy and make sure to transact only in euros even when credit card machines prompt you otherwise, London-based fintech firm Wise said in a report about preparing for the Paris Olympics. It also warns against resorting to airport or hotel exchanges, which deliberately charge you more.\n\n\u201cAirports and hotels cater to a captive audience. Their exchange services will reflect this in\n\ntheir higher fees and poorer rates,\u201d the report said.\n\nOther suggested tips include having backup payment options in case your primary card fails and checking if your home bank has any affiliates in France that\u2019ll absorb some of the transaction fees.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing people need to be aware of when exploring the streets of Paris\u2014the pickpockets.\n\n\u201cWith more tourists in the city, there may be an increase in petty crime and scams targeting visitors,\u201d said Johannes Thomas, the CEO of German-based travel platform Trivago, citing the example of \u201cthe friendship bracelet scam\u201d at attractions like Sacre-Coeur.\n\n\u201cAvoid flashing any valuables or cash that may draw negative attention. Additionally, avoid street performers or street games, especially [ones] involving money, as this can often be a planned distraction to set up a pickpocket.\u201d\n\nBetter safe than sorry\n\nBeware of the pick pockets. Peter Dazeley\u2014Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s no easy way out with the crowds, no matter where in Paris you go. So, it\u2019s probably best to embrace it, Thomas said.\n\n\u201cExpect overcrowding, long lines and overwhelmed services at popular tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and other major sites. Anticipate increased prices. Accommodation, food and transportation costs tend to spike during major events. Visitors may face significantly higher prices, especially for hotels and short-term rentals in central Paris,\u201d he added.\n\nPlanning trips during peak travel season often brings uncertainties\u2014delays, last-minute cancellations, lost bags, and more. It\u2019s tricky to prepare for each of these scenarios, but travel insurance can be the key to feeling more in control of your trip.\n\nPeople could face three types of risks when traveling: financial, medical and travel, Rajeev Shrivastava, founder and CEO of VisitorsCoverage, a travel and health insurance marketplace, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cPeople [who] are making these trips have made some heavy investments, including their tickets and the stay,\u201d Shrivastava said.\n\nThe risks of impromptu cancellations, peak summer heat, and rampant petty crime could become unnecessary stressors in a long-anticipated trip. That\u2019s where travel insurance can help\u2014it lifts the burden off visitors, protecting them in case of unforeseen losses.\n\n\u201cMany insurance policies have coverage for many of these events,\u201d Shrivastava said, adding that insurance is a tool that people consider with varying degrees of seriousness, depending on how much they\u2019ve traveled.\n\nShrivastava says another way to ensure safety is to have emergency contacts who travelers can contact.\n\n\u201cLet your family remain informed [or] whoever you believe and trust about where you are, where you\u2019re traveling to, and what of transportation you are taking,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen in France\u2026 try being French?\n\nTime to brush up on your French skills. Westend61\u2014Getty Images\n\nCruising your way through Paris isn\u2019t just about getting on the right bus or staying in the right neighborhood. It\u2019s also about taking in some of the culture and blending into the city where you can. Noel Wolf, a language teacher and cultural expert at language learning platform Babbel, thinks learning some basic phrases can be a game-changer.\n\n\u201cNot only does being able to communicate in the local language facilitate cultural connection, but it is crucial for keeping travelers safe in high-stress, large-scale events such as the Olympics,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nBrushing up on your French will also come in handy when asking for directions or seeking help, making you feel more safe. People tend to regret not knowing the local language, adding to the stress of travel, Babbel found in a survey.\n\n\u201cTravelers will also need to familiarize themselves with the geography and public transportation in Paris, so in the event of an emergency or getting separated from their travel partners, attendees can have a general idea of where they are within the city and navigate their way back home,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nOther etiquette tips, such as saying \u201cBonjour\u201d and keeping a low voice at restaurants, are also helpful to remember.\n\nAnd with that, you should be all set for a Parisian summer. Safe travels, or as the French would say, bon voyage!",

        "title": "5 ways to keep work from getting in the way of your relationship",
        "body": "Do you spend more time in bed with your laptop, answering Slack messages, than you do with your partner? Then it may be time for a reality check.\n\nWhen our romantic relationships carry too much of the burden of our professional life, it can lead to resentment, jealousy, and, ultimately, a breakup\u2014especially when we expect our partners to carry an unfair share of our work stress.\n\n\u201cWe bring a set of expectations that our intimate partners are a source of emotional support, and that we can be our most authentic versions of ourselves,\u201d Alexandra Solomon, a Chicago-based psychologist and host of the podcast Reimagining Love, tells Fortune. And while it\u2019s a \u201cblessing\u201d when find that, she adds, \u201cIt comes back to bite us when we\u2019re not mindful of the impact that our burnout has on how we\u2019re showing up for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a widespread problem: In Deloitte\u2019s Workplace Burnout Survey, for example, 83% of respondents said burnout from work can negatively impact their personal relationships. Similarly, in Headspace\u2019s 2024 Workforce State of Mind report, 71% of employees shared that work stress has caused a personal relationship to end.\n\nA big part of the problem, Solomon says, is that the boundary between work and home life, especially with remote and hybrid work structures, can be difficult to draw. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to set time and energy aside for each facet of our lives, including time to connect with our partners\u2013\u2013outside of discussing work projects.\n\nHere are five tips for ensuring work burnout doesn\u2019t squash the romance in your life.\n\n1. Resist the urge to compare\n\nOften, when both partners are having a difficult time at work, Solomon says there is a tendency to become competitive\u2014with a workplace-stress Olympics, if you will.\n\n\u201cThe conversation can begin like, \u2018I want to share my day with you because you are a really important sounding board and safe place,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut the conversation can have a sneaky way of morphing into a comparison of who has it worse.\u201d\n\nSolomon suggests resisting the urge to compare your experience with your partner\u2019s, and to remember that all stress\u2014including the kind that comes about in this type of competition\u2014is unwanted and can have a negative impact on our health.\n\n2. Set \u2018micro rituals\u2018\n\nCreating ways to symbolize the transition from working time to home time\u2014even, if not especially, if you work from home\u2014can be pivotal for the strength of your relationship.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s their commute home, or when you\u2019re changing clothes from your workday, almost ritualizing, \u2018I\u2019m taking off the day, I have done my job, I showed up, I did what I was supposed to do. It will be waiting for me tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever kind of ways you can set a micro ritual to transition from the workday to time with your partner,\u201d she says, it will be worth it.\n\n3. Performance reviews aren\u2019t just for the office\n\nPerformance metrics, desired raises, and a basic need to stay employed are all reliable motivators when it comes to doing a great job at work. But what about staying motivated at home?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think, \u2018A year from now I want to feel more connected to my partner,\u2019 \u2018I want us to have accomplished this goal in our life,\u201d Jenna Glover, licensed psychologist and Chief Clinical Officer at Headspace, tells Fortune. But, she stresses, maybe we should.\n\n\u201cPart of that is intentionality and really bringing it to that [home] space,\u201d Glover explains. \u201cAnd when people do, they\u2019re able to be successful in both work and relationships.\u201d\n\nGlover suggests relationship performance reviews as one way to ensure we don\u2019t lose ourselves in work or miss out on important time with our partner.\n\n\u201cTake time to say, \u2018There is not a template built for what it means to be successful in my relationship like a work performance review, but I\u2019m going to take the time to identify what that would actually look like,\u2019\u201d she suggests.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about it being too formal. Instead, Glover says the point is to focus while sitting down with your partner and sharing goals and expectations for your family, your career, and your one-on-one connection.\n\n4. Salvage \u2018romance\u2019 by defining it expansively\n\nIt\u2019s true that stress impacts libido. According to the Cleveland Clinic, stress can reduce your sex drive by taking your mind off sexual desire, and chronic stress can interfere with hormone levels, which also results in a lower libido.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s desire increases because of pressure,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nBut romance and connection with your partner do not have to start and end with sex, she says.\n\n\u201cThe definition of \u2018romantic\u2019 is the stuff we do that helps us feel connected,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there are lots of ways to feel connected besides sex.\u201d\n\nShe suggests making small but meaningful nods toward intimacy and toward counteracting your work burnout\u2014playing a game with your partner, dancing in the kitchen together, or lighting candles while you eat dinner, for example.\n\n\u201cPart of it is pushing back,\u201d Solomon says, \u201cand saying, \u2018No, my job does not get to take both my time and my sexual energy.\u2019\u201d\n\n5. Try to avoid putting your partner on the defensive\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re missing out on time with your partner due either one of your jobs (or both), a gentle way to start trying to counteract that is to ease into a conversation about it: How about an evening with no screens? What about scheduling a fun outing? Your partner cannot always read your mind or body language for clues as to what you want, Solomon says.\n\nBut pointing fingers and laying blame, she adds, can lead to them feeling attacked and guilty, putting them on the defense. Instead, take a beat to calmly tell your partner you miss their undivided attention.\n\nPlus, she stresses, work burnout is often, if not always, about the company culture rather than the employee. So while it can be easy to put the blame on your partner for answering messages about work after hours, it\u2019s also up to their employer to adhere to off-the-clock boundaries.\n\n\u201c[Your partner] didn\u2019t create the corporate culture that demands that people are available at all hours, or refuses to hire the right number of people to do the work, or whatever the dynamics are in the organization,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think that part of it, too, is making sure to put responsibility where responsibility goes.\u201d\n\nIn fact, nearly 70% of professionals, according to Deloitte, feel their employers are not doing enough to prevent or alleviate burnout within their organization, and 21% say their company does not offer any programs or initiatives to prevent or alleviate it.\n\n\u201cPeople need to work. So it\u2019s really important for employees to think about, \u2018What is my work experience like?\u2019 and hopefully work is there to support the quality of your life and not to degrade it,\u201d says Glover.\n\nShe adds that we all have limited resources\u2014limited time, limited energy\u2014and that putting \u201ctoo much\u201d toward a job will ensure you won\u2019t have a good work-life balance.\n\nAnd parsing that out is something that gets more and more difficult, Solomon says, as \u201cwork-life balance\u201d terminology itself can be deceiving.\n\n\u201cIn our minds, we have this belief that these are two separate spheres,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the boundary between home and work is actually quite permeable.\u201d\n\nMore on marriage and relationships:",

        "title": "Democrats close ranks around Joe Biden after disastrous debate",
        "body": "President Joe Biden worked forcefully Friday to quell Democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing in his debate with former President Donald Trump, as elected members of his party closed ranks around him in an effort to shut down talk of replacing him atop the ticket.\n\nBiden\u2019s halting delivery and meandering comments, particularly early in the debate, fueled concerns from even members of his own party that at age 81 he\u2019s not up for the task of leading the country for another four years. It created a crisis moment for Biden\u2019s campaign and his presidency, as members of his party flirted with potential replacements, and donors and supporters couldn\u2019t contain their concern about his showing against Trump.\n\nBiden appeared to acknowledge the criticism during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying \u201dI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to.\u201d But he added, \u201cI know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.\u201d Speaking for 18 minutes, Biden appeared far more animated than he had the night before as he excoriated Trump for his \u201clies\u201d and for waging a campaign aimed at \u201crevenge and retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice in this election is simple,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.\u201d\n\nHe added, alluding to his candidacy, \u201cWhen you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d\n\nEven before the debate, Biden\u2019s age had been a liability with voters, and Thursday night\u2019s faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will garner in the four months until Election Day.\n\nPrivately, his campaign worked to tamp down concerns and keep donors and surrogates on board. Democratic lawmakers on Friday acknowledged Biden\u2019s poor showing, but tried to stop talk of replacing him as their standard-bearer, and instead shift the focus to Trump\u2019s attacks and falsehoods.\n\n\u201cWell, the president didn\u2019t have a good night, but neither did Donald Trump with lie after lie and his dark vision for America,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told The Associated Press on Friday, hours before he introduced the president in Raleigh. \u201cWe cannot send Donald Trump back to the White House. He\u2019s an existential threat to our nation.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama backed up his former vice president, posting on X that \u201cBad debate nights happen.\u201d Alluding to his own poor showing in the first debate of his reelection campaign in 2012, Obama continued, \u201cTrust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLast night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries answered with a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked Friday if Biden should step aside.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., allowed he \u201chad to take a few more antidepressants than usual\u201d after Biden\u2019s debate showing.\n\nBut he added that \u201ca Donald Trump presidency would cause me far greater discomfort than a Joe Biden debate performance.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign billed the Raleigh event as the largest-yet rally of his reelection bid in the state Trump carried by the narrowest margin in 2020. He then traveled to New York for a weekend of big-dollar fundraisers that his campaign now needs more than ever.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign announced that it raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, while Trump\u2019s campaign said it raised more than $8 million from the start of the debate through the end of the night.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, whom the Biden campaign sent out to defend his performance, tried to reassure Biden supporters at a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, saying, \u201cThis race will not be decided by one night in June.\n\n\u201cThis race will be decided by you. By us,\u201d she said. \u201cWho sits in the White House next year will be determined by what we together do in these next 130 days.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said there had been no internal conversations \u201cwhatsoever\u201d about Biden stepping aside, though he, too, acknowledged that the president had a \u201cbad night\u201d on stage.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said he could hardly sleep because of the number of telephone calls he got after Biden performed \u201chorribly\u201d in the debate.\n\n\u201cPeople were just concerned. And I told everybody being concerned is healthy, overreacting is dangerous,\u201d Cleaver said.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat whose support in that state helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination four years ago, said he would likely speak to Biden later Friday and his message would be simple: \u201cStay the course.\u201d\n\nBiden and his team have long wagered that voters would look past their concerns about his age and unpopularity when confronted at the ballot box with a choice between the president and Trump. Despite their concerns about Biden\u2019s performance, they took solace in Trump doing little to expand his own appeal to voters on Thursday.\n\nPolls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men\u2019s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s conviction.\n\nDemocrats seized on Trump\u2019s equivocations on whether he would accept the will of voters this time around, his refusal to condemn the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, and his embrace of the conservative-leaning Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade that had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nBut Biden fumbled on abortion rights, one of the most important issues for Democrats in this year\u2019s election. He was unable to explain Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A conservative Supreme Court with three justices nominated by Trump overturned Roe two years ago.\n\nAs elected Democrats united behind Biden publicly, donors and party operatives shared panicked text messages and phone calls Thursday night and into Friday expressing their concern that Biden\u2019s performance was so bad that he may be unelectable this fall.\n\nAmong the few public Democratic voices calling on Biden to step aside was congressional candidate Nancy Boyda in Kansas, who broke with most in her party and called on Biden to suspend his campaign and retire at the end of his current term.\n\nBut there were no immediate signs of organized efforts among donors, his campaign leadership or the Democratic National Committee to convince the president to step aside, according to interviews with several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat frequently mentioned as a 2028 contender and speculated about as a potential replacement for Biden, released a statement backing him on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe difference between Joe Biden\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November,\u201d she said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom also dismissed questions on whether he would consider stepping in for Biden, telling reporters, \u201cI will never turn my back on him.\u201d\n\nUnder current Democratic Party rules, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace Biden as the party\u2019s nominee without his cooperation or without party officials being willing to rewrite the rules at the August national convention.\n\nTrump was set to hold a rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward Democrats in recent years but that his aides believe can flip toward the Republican in November.",

        "body": "More than 90% of Americans are planning to travel domestically this summer, and 37% plan to go abroad, according to a recent study from the financial services company Empower.\n\nBut to meet their vacation plans, consumers must continue to grapple with inflation and high prices, and nearly half of survey respondents said they planned to spend more on travel in 2024 than last year. So to bankroll their restlessness, Americans are putting other major life plans on hold.\n\nOne in five millennials\u2014and 17% of Gen Zers\u2014plan to postpone important life purchases, like buying a home, to pay for travel, according to the study. Roughly a third of all Americans said they won\u2019t wait for retirement to see the world and are prioritizing travel now.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just major financial milestones like buying a home and retirement that are being placed on the backburner, according to Empower. People are cutting back in little ways to pay for travel as well\u2014and in some cases, going into debt.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Gen Xers and millennials said they were cutting back on dining out to pay for travel, and nearly 10% of all respondents in the Empower study said they\u2019ve taken on debt to finance their trips, averaging $2,849. Of those people, more than a quarter said paying down their debt would take a year or longer.\n\nIn 2023, the travel industry boomed as consumer demand for experiences came back with a vengeance in the wake of the pandemic. A year later, that desire doesn\u2019t seem to have subsided. The Friday before Memorial Day, more than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports, breaking a single-day record set around Thanksgiving last year.\n\nOver the course of the summer, airlines expect to carry 271 million people, 6.3% more than the record-breaking season they had last year.\n\nA recent report from Expedia showed that Americans are more desperate than ever to get away: 65% of survey respondents told the travel company they felt deprived of vacation, even more than in the height of the pandemic.\n\nChristie Hudson, head of public relations at Expedia, told Fortune that a significant share of survey respondents plan to travel \u201cno matter what\u201d in 2024.\n\n\u201cIn terms of attitude and valuing experiences over things, that whole mentality, people seem very aligned coming out of the pandemic,\u201d said said.",

        "title": "Donald Trump says immigration is taking 'Black jobs.' Top economists: No",
        "body": "Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about \u201cBlack jobs\u201d that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, Trump said that President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cbig kill\u201d on Black people was allowing an influx of immigrants through the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs now\u2014and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs, and they\u2019re taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you\u2019re gonna see something that\u2019s going to be the worst in our history.\u201d\n\nMichelle Holder, a renowned labor economist who studies racial inequities, said she was dismayed and confused by the term.\n\n\u201cIt was insulting to me, as a Black labor economist, to hear the term \u2018black jobs,\u2019\u201d she told Fortune. She added that the comment, which was supposed to appeal to Black voters, likely \u201cbackfired.\u201d\n\nBlack workers have fared well under both the Trump and Biden administrations. The Black unemployment rate remains at historic lows. In September 2019, under Trump, the unemployment rate for the group fell to 5.3%, a record low at the time. Under Biden, it dropped even further to a new low of 4.8% in April 2023.\n\nToday, Black unemployment has risen slightly, to 6.1%, ticking up along with the national rate, which is at 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of Black Americans with jobs\u2014at 59.1%\u2014is still near a peak of 60.4% set last year.\n\nDespite the progress, the quote echos a long-held argument: An influx of immigration takes jobs away from native-born workers, or, at the very least, depresses their wages. Fortune asked Lant Pritchett, a leading immigration economist who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School and researches at University of Oxford, about this. He said that among economists, the question is \u201cpretty settled.\u201d\n\nImmigration does not take away native jobs\n\nThere is \u201calmost no evidence\u201d of an influx of immigration displacing disadvantaged workers, Pritchett said. He pointed to the study UC Berkeley economist David Card won a Nobel Prize for, which analyzed the impact of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift that brought hundreds of thousands of Cubans to Miami in a manner of months. Card found \u201cno effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers.\u201d If anything, wages rose relative to their previous trend in Miami.\n\nThe result was so surprising that economists analyzed the study again and again, attempting to understand how the real-life result defied economic principles. Card replicated the study with different cities, and another time with different types of immigrants, and found the same conclusion. Other economists found the same results in their own studies.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that\u2019s gone on in this immigration literature in the last few years is that we\u2019ve kind of concluded that there\u2019s a relatively small effect of it for competing natives,\u201d Card said in a previous interview.\n\nThen, in 2017, Harvard economist George Borjas replicated the study with a smaller definition of \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers and found their wages collapsed. The result drew attention from the Atlantic, National Review, and New Yorker, among others, and was heralded by Republicans.\n\nThe study also found that Black workers\u2019 wages fell, but Card cast doubt on the findings.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bI have followed this closely, but my sense is that other people who have looked into this in detail are not convinced,\u201d he told Fortune in a message on Friday.\n\nPritchett is one of them. He referred to an analysis done by another economist, Michael Clemens, who found that Borjas\u2019s study relied on only 17 individuals, much too small of a sample size to be relied on. He said that the hype around Borjas\u2019s work came from those with an anti-immigrant bias who were willing to cherry-pick data to prove it.\n\n\u201cIf you started from the question, what are things that are disadvantaging African Americans in economic progress, and you came to the conclusion that immigration was one of the big factors, I would listen to you,\u201d Pritchett said. \u201cBut if you start from a position, I\u2019m against immigration and have been in all ways, and then come to the conclusion that it negatively affects African Americans, I\u2019m pretty skeptical.\u201d\n\nThe need for more workers\n\nPritchett\u2019s research suggests that America will soon desperately need millions of workers to cover a \u201chistorically unprecedented\u201d gap in the labor force.\n\nAmerica\u2014like most wealthy countries\u2014has an aging population and could soon be faced with fewer workers. Over the decade of 2020 to 2030, the U.S. working-aged population will fall by 4.5 million people without immigration, according to a United Nations report. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that between 2021 and 2031, there will be 3.2 million net new jobs in entry-level positions.\n\n\u201cThat math cannot be made to add up,\u201d Pritchett said with a chuckle. \u201cYou can\u2019t fill 3 million new jobs with negative 4 million people.\u201d\n\nThe policy challenge used to be to find a job for every worker. Now, the U.S. will struggle to find a worker for every job, Pritchett said.\n\nSome experts have already suggested that immigrants are \u201csaving\u201d the U.S. from a taut labor market. Between January 2020 and July 2023, the immigrant labor force grew by 9.5%, dwarfing the 1.5% growth rate among native-born workers.\n\nWhat are the economic issues that do concern Black americans?\n\nThe most concerning issues for Black Americans, Holder said, are wages, inflation, and unemployment.\n\nBlack unemployment reached a historic low last year, she said. Can we sustain these current economic conditions? And, how are those jobs paying Black Americans?\n\nRather than using immigration to stoke fear, she wants Trump to answer those questions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think Black voters want to hear about,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we are really wrapped up in trying to blame migrants for any problems facing the Black community at this point.\u201d",
        "summary": "Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about \u201cBlack jobs\u201d that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking Black jobs now\u2014and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cIt was insulting to me, as a Black labor economist, to hear the term \u2018black jobs,\u2019\u201d she told Fortune.\nToday, Black unemployment has risen slightly, to 6.1%, ticking up along with the national rate, which is at 4%.\nFortune asked Lant Pritchett, a leading immigration economist who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School and researches at University of Oxford, about this.",

        "body": "Microsoft Corp.\u2019s $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is set to come under added scrutiny from European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdogs, who are poised to quiz rivals about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s antitrust chief, announced Friday that the EU has ruled out an investigation under the EU\u2019s merger rules into the deal. Instead, she announced that regulators are asking Microsoft\u2019s rivals about the US company\u2019s exclusivity clauses with OpenAI, and whether they might have a negative effect on competition.\n\nBloomberg reported the news earlier.\n\nAs well as the focus on Microsoft, the EU will also circulate questions to the market on Google\u2019s arrangement with Samsung Electronics Co. to pre-install its small model \u201cGemini nano\u201d on certain devices.\n\nVestager added in a speech that regulators are examining attempts by Big Tech to buy firms by way of mass hires. The EU preliminary step comes after the US Federal Trade Commission launched investigations into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of Inflection staff.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure these practices don\u2019t slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\u201d Vestager said.\n\nUnder the terms of Microsoft\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, Microsoft\u2019s Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI \u2014 something that EU regulators want to examine more.\n\nSuch preliminary questions from the EU can sometimes lead to formal investigations from the EU\u2019s antitrust regulators. These probes \u2014 in the long run \u2014 can result in orders to change behavior and potential fines if watchdogs unearth evidence of abusive practices hampering fair competition.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the European Commission\u2019s thorough review and its conclusion that Microsoft\u2019s investment and partnership with OpenAI does not give Microsoft control over the company,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cWe stand ready to respond to any additional questions the EC may have.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\n\nThe EU\u2019s antitrust arm said in January it was reviewing whether Microsoft\u2019s involvement with OpenAI should be vetted after a mutiny at the ChatGPT creator exposed deep ties between the two firms.\n\nThe partnership first piqued the interest of regulators \u2014 including, as well as the EU, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission \u2014 since a scandal embroiled the AI firm over the firing and subsequent rehiring of Sam Altman as chief of OpenAI late last year.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella personally helped negotiate and advocate for his return to the company \u2014 at one point offering to hire Altman himself, along with other employees at OpenAI who wanted to leave.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board eventually agreed to reinstate Altman and the company then named a three-person interim board and added Microsoft as a non-voting observer.\n\nThat episode led regulators to examine the agreement. The UK watchdog said it would examine whether the balance of power between the two firms has fundamentally shifted to give one side more control or influence over the other, and the US Federal Trade Commission has made inquiries into the agreement.\n\nAt the core of the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI is the massive amounts of computer power required to keep the worldwide boom in generative AI going. Running the systems behind tools such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard has sent demand for cloud services and processing capacity soaring. OpenAI, for example, has become a major customer of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business.\n\nUnder the EU\u2019s merger rules, officials vet deals under strict time frames and often push for remedies to allay specific competition concerns. While deals are in rare cases vetoed, firms generally don\u2019t face punishments unless they mislead regulators or stymie the process.\n\nThe EU\u2019s classic competition law is generally used to home in on potentially anti-competitive agreements between firms and also cases where powerful players abuse their dominance. If wrongdoing is found, fines can rise to 10% of a company\u2019s revenue.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\n\nThis week the EU accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.",

        "title": "A Wells Fargo analyst ordered the same Chipotle burrito bowl 75 times and found the portion problem is real",
        "body": "Chipotle executives have sworn up and down that the restaurant chain doesn\u2019t have a portion problem, but an analysis by Wells Fargo begs to differ.\n\nTo finally \u201cput the \u2018weight debate\u2019 to rest,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem and his team bought and weighed 75 burrito bowls, they wrote in a note this week. The analysts \u201cstudied\u201d (and hopefully later devoured) burrito bowls at eight different Chipotle locations in New York City, with half the orders placed digitally and the other half in person.\n\nThroughout the study, the analysts found that the bowls\u2019 weights were wildly inconsistent.\n\nThe median bowl ordered online and in person weighed about the same, according to the Thursday note, but the weight of the burrito bowls varied drastically in each category. For in-person orders, the heaviest bowl weighed 47% more than the lightest. The weight varied even more for digital orders, with the heaviest bowl weighing 87% more than the lightest bowl. At 13.8 ounces, the smallest burrito bowl weighed just a little more than the average can of soda.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s at least one New York City Chipotle that may also be worth avoiding, as the analysts found that many of the 10 lightest bowls were from the same unnamed store. All 10 were also digital orders.\n\n\u201cWhile throughput is improving, order consistency remains an opportunity,\u201d the analysts wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nA special look\n\nThe analysis comes as Chipotle has been criticized on social media for doling out supposedly smaller portion sizes. A rumor, which Chipotle denied, later emerged that the chain had instructed employees to give bigger portions to people recording them, sparking a flurry of videos across social media, especially on TikTok.\n\nLast month, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told Fortune that portion sizes had not gotten smaller, but added that customers could give employees a \u201clook\u201d to bulk up their burritos.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chipotle founder and former CEO Steve Ells reiterated that the restaurant chain\u2019s portions have not shrunk and insisted that it has, in fact, been \u201cquite generous\u201d with its portion sizes, Quartz reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced someone walking out of a Chipotle hungry in my 30 some odd years, I mean, it just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Ells said at the Wall Street Journal Global Food Forum. \u201cSo those who complain about portion sizes, I\u2019m not sure I quite get it, but I understand it\u2019s a thing out there.\u201d\n\nAlthough the varying bowl sizes may have looked bad for the chain, Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, Laurie Schalow, said the variability was totally normal because of how the restaurant serves its orders.\n\n\u201cSimilar to others in the fast casual industry, our completely customizable meals may have variability in their size or weight depending upon the number of ingredients a guest selects or if they choose to make an ingredient extra or light when ordering from our list of real ingredients in person or digitally,\u201d Schalow said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nDespite the controversy over portion sizes, Wells Fargo found that Chipotle\u2019s foot traffic continues to increase, aside from a setback last month, and the bank is still optimistic about the stock. The company\u2019s quarter-to-date foot traffic is at its highest level in 10 quarters, the bank found.",

        "body": "Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.\n\nA bench of five judges of the apex court presided by Chief Justice Martha Koome also held that Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act do not contradict or prohibit banks and financial institutions and their customers from bargaining and entering into a mutual contract concerning interest rates that will be applied to loan facilities.\n\nHowever, the judges said interest rates on loans are subject to the regulation under Section 44 of the Banking Act, which states that \u201cNo institution shall increase its rate of banking or other charges except with the prior approval of the Minister.\u201d\n\nAccording to the court, while a contract that is mutually agreed by parties might provide the bank with the discretion to alter or vary interest rates on loans, that discretion is not absolute or unlimited.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion on this issue, we find that interest rates on loans and facilities advanced by banks or financial institutions are subject to the regulatory process under Section 44 of the Banking Act,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe court added the approval of the Treasury Cabinet Secretary before increasing interest rates ensures that there is some check and balance or oversight to ensure that consumers of the loan facilities are not exploited and that the rates are reasonable.\n\nThe Banking (Increase of Rate of Banking And other Charges) Regulations, 2006, states that an application for approval of an increase in the rate of banking or other charges under Section 44 of the Act, shall be submitted to the Minister through the Central Bank of Kenya Governor.\n\nOther Supreme Court judges who made the ruling were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, and Njoki Ndung\u2019u.\n\nThe judges were deciding a long-running dispute between Stanbic Bank and Santowels Ltd, a manufacturer of sanitary towels.\n\nThe manufacturer said its relationship with the bank hit the rocks in 2002 when it began having doubts concerning the interest charged by the lender. The company consequently paid its outstanding debt and closed its accounts with the lender the same year.\n\nSantowels later engaged Interest Rates Advisory Centre (IRAC) Ltd to recalculate the interest charged on the Stanbic loans. IRAC found that the bank had overcharged the manufacturer interest amounting to Sh68 million.\n\nThe firm moved to court seeking a refund of the overcharged interest.\n\nThe matter moved to the Supreme Court as parties sought the court\u2019s interpretation of the two sections of the Banking Act.\n\nThe lender argued in the second appeal that there are various court decisions on whether provisions of Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act apply to other bank charges, commissions, and rates but also to interest.\n\nStanbic Bank argued that there is uncertainty in the law as there are several contradicting decisions from the courts, on the question of rate of banking and interest variation and when ministerial consent is required.\n\nStanbic argued that regulations cannot override the provisions of Section 52(1) of the Banking Act, in cases where contractual charges are already in place.\n\nThe section states that \"For the avoidance of doubt, no contravention of the provisions of this Act or the Central Bank of Kenya Act shall affect or invalidate in any way any contractual obligation between an institution and any other person.\"\n\nSantowels, however, argued that the maximum rate that banks were entitled to charge their customers by law and as gazetted by CBK was 16.5 percent per annum on a reducing balance.\n\nThe court ruled that the interest it was charged was above what had been set by the CBK in 1997, hence illegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the primary objective of the Banking Act is to regulate banking business in Kenya.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the overarching reason for interest rate capping and/or regulation is to protect consumers from exploitative rates, to increase access to finance, and make credit affordable,\u201d the judges added.\n\nThe court held that the effect of the repeal of Section 39 of the CBK Act and Section 33B of the Banking Act did not completely liberalise the interest rates that banks and financial institutions can charge.\n\nRather, it meant that regulation through capped interest rates was no longer in force, the court said.\n\nThe government in September 2016 imposed legal caps on lending rates at four percentage points above the Central Bank\u2019s benchmark \u2014 then prevailing at nine percent \u2014 and set the maximum borrowing rate at 13 percent.\n\nThe caps were scrapped in 2019 after they were found unconstitutional by the High Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the regulation through the capping of interest rates simply set the parameters within which banks and financial institutions and their customers can negotiate or interact on the issue of interest rates.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis and finding with respect to Section 44 of the Banking Act, the provision plays a different regulatory role yet complementary to that which capped interest rates played,\u201d said the judges.",

        "title": "Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: An exploration of its potential",
        "body": "Kisspeptins, a family of compounds encoded by the KISS1 gene, have garnered significant interest in the scientific community due to their intriguing potential in various physiological processes. Among these, Kisspeptin-10, a decapeptide derived from the cleavage of the primary kisspeptin precursor, has emerged as a particularly notable molecule.\n\nThis article explores the potential functions and mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10 in biological systems, emphasising its hypothesised influence in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, and tumor suppression.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Structural and biochemical characteristics\n\nKisspeptin-10, consisting of ten amino acids, is the shortest active form of the kisspeptins. Studies suggest that its structure allows it to bind effectively to the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54 (also known as KISS1R).\n\nThis receptor-ligand interaction is crucial for the peptide's biological activity.\n\nResearch indicates that the binding of Kisspeptin-10 to GPR54 may trigger a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways, primarily involving phospholipase C and the subsequent release of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These events may lead to an influence in intracellular calcium levels and the activation of protein kinase C, which are critical for the downstream impacts observed in various tissues.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Reproductive physiology\n\nOne of the most extensively studied potential roles of Kisspeptin-10 is in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might act as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion.\n\nThis, in turn, may influence the secretion of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones are pivotal for regulating gonadal function, including steroid and gametogenesis.\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 might play a critical role in the onset of puberty. It has been theorized that the increased expression of Kisspeptin and its receptor during this developmental stage might be a key trigger for the reactivation of the HPG axis, leading to the maturation of the reproductive system.\n\nMoreover, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to regulate reproductive processes, potentially modulating the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: metabolism\n\nBeyond its reproductive functions, Kisspeptin-10 is also speculated to significantly affect metabolic processes. A growing body of data suggests that kisspeptins might be involved in regulating energy homeostasis.\n\nKisspeptin-10 is expressed in several regions of the brain that are known to be critical for metabolic control, including the hypothalamus. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might influence appetite and food intake by interacting with other neuropeptides and hormones involved in energy balance, such as leptin and insulin.\n\nFurthermore, studies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might play a role in glucose homeostasis. Preliminary research indicates that Kisspeptin-10 might increase insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.\n\nThese properties suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have potential implications for managing metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, although more extensive studies are needed to fully understand these mechanisms.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Tumors\n\nAnother intriguing aspect of Kisspeptin-10 is its potential role in tumor suppression. The KISS1 gene was initially identified as a metastasis suppressor gene in melanoma cells. Subsequent research has indicated that Kisspeptin-10 and its receptor might inhibit the metastatic spread of various cancers, including breast, prostate, and gastric.\n\nIt is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10's anti-tumorigenic properties might be mediated through several mechanisms. For instance, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to cease cell migration and invasion by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that affect the extracellular matrix and facilitate tumor metastasis. Kisspeptin-10 might induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, contributing to its potential anti-cancer potential.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Cardiovascular and neuroprotective research\n\nEmerging data suggests that Kisspeptin-10 might also have protective parts in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the cardiovascular context, Kisspeptin-10 is expressed in the heart and blood vessels and is theorized to influence vascular tone and blood pressure regulation.\n\nStudies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have vasoconstrictive impacts, which might be mediated through its interaction with the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.\n\nIn the nervous system, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to exert neuroprotective impacts. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might protect neurons from excitotoxic damage and oxidative stress, potentially by activating survival pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. These properties might have implications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, although further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved.\n\nKisspeptin-10 Peptide: Conclusion\n\nInvestigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 is a multifaceted peptide with a wide range of potential biological functions. Its possible roles in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, tumor suppression, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection highlight its importance in maintaining organismal homeostasis.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10, many aspects of its functions and implications remain speculative and warrant further investigation. As research continues to uncover the complexities of this peptide, it may pave the way for novel strategies in various fields.\n\nPlease remember that none of the compounds mentioned in this paper have been approved for human or animal consumption.\n\nReferences\n\n[i] Navarro VM.

Borrowing costs soared and Russia's war in Ukraine exacerbated a rise in prices of fuel and food.\n\nMembers of the Bolivian army guard the entrance to Plaza Murillo while President Luis Arce \"denounced the irregular mobilisation\" of some units of the country's army in La Paz, Bolivia on June 26, 2024.

This puts pressure on countries, including Kenya, to raise taxes and cut spending.\n\nIn 2023, a record 54 developing countries, equivalent to 38 percent of the total, allocated 10 percent or more of government revenues to interest payments, with nearly half of them in Africa, according to a report from UN Trade and Development agency UNCTAD.\n\nMultilateral banks and political risk firms have warned of a ticking time bomb for some time.\n\nWhile debt relief efforts had centred on the poorest nations with solvency problems, and rightly so according to the World Bank, not enough had been done for lower middle-income countries facing temporary liquidity pressures in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without action, 2024 will see a further rise in debt vulnerability \u2014 potentially leading to reversals in development outcomes,\" World Bank senior managing director Axel van Trotsenburg warned.\n\nRising pain\n\nKenya, like others, borrowed heavily in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were low -- and China was splashing cash via its Belt and Road initiative to lend to emerging markets worldwide.\n\nOver the past 20 years Kenya amassed some $82 billion of debt to build roads, railways and factories.\n\nBut not all ambitious projects were completed, and many Kenyans felt they had not benefited, while a slew of corruption scandals spurred allegations that elites enriched themselves.\n\n\"There is no cut on corruption,\" Boniface Mwangi, a prominent social justice activist in Kenya told Reuters. \"We have no problem paying debt, but...what did you do with that money that you borrowed?\"\n\nRuto has said he is waging a war on corruption and has called for those responsible for graft to be prosecuted.\n\nKenya managed to avoid default by issuing more debt earlier this year - but at a punishing interest rate above 10 percent.

        "body": "Throughout history, gold trading has solidified as a pillar of investment methods, providing a stable haven within the turbulence of unpredictable economic conditions.\n\nEntering the world of gold trading might seem intimidating to novices at first, but with a firm understanding of its fundamentals, one can embark on this rewarding journey with confidence.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on the mysterious world of gold trading, this article provides traders who are new to the game with helpful advice and methods.\n\nUnderstanding the basics of gold trading\n\nBuying and selling gold with the intention of making a profit is the core of the art of gold trading. In contrast to long-term gold storage under your mattress, trading is all about riding the waves of momentary price fluctuations.\n\nThere are several methods to become involved in this vibrant market: you may invest in gold futures, horde real gold like a pirate with coins and bars, ride along on gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), or even mine stocks.\n\nEvery route has its own set of hazards and tricks, so it pays to be aware of the terrain and choose your poison carefully depending on what makes your heart race and how much danger you can take.\n\nTechnical analysis: The foundation of gold trading\n\nIn gold trading, technical analysis is similar to detective work. It entails closely examining price charts to look for hints about potential future moves. These include determining trend lines, head and shoulders or double top patterns, and support and resistance levels.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and moving averages are examples of indicators that may be used as research instruments to provide information about possible price movements and market sentiment.\n\nGaining proficiency in technical analysis enables traders to accurately interpret market signals and make well-informed judgments for successful trading strategies.\n\nThe role of fundamental analysis\n\nWhen it comes to gold trading, fundamental research is akin to penetrating the rich past concealed below the glossy exterior.\n\nFinding the economic statistics, central bank policies, and international political dramas that drive up gold prices is the key. For example, be prepared for a stronger dollar and a possible decline in gold prices when the Fed suggests rising interest rates.\n\nThis is because gold loses value when other currencies gain value. Traders may anticipate changes in the market and adjust their strategies to optimize their earnings by analyzing these intricately linked narratives.\n\nDeveloping a trading strategy\n\nThe secret to being an expert in gold trading is developing a solid trading plan. It's similar to planning a route: decide on the appropriate vehicle (trading instruments), pack for your comfort level (risk tolerance), and know where you're going (defined goals).\n\nManaging risk is your compass, whether you're swinging slowly for a few days or running through the day. Put stop-loss orders in place to avoid risk and profit as soon as your goal comes into view. Adhere to your strategy religiously, and you will witness the glittering success of your trading career.\n\nUtilising trading platforms and tools\n\nFor astute traders, modern trading platforms are a veritable treasure of tools and resources. Imagine having access to technical analysis tools, news feeds, and real-time price charts at your fingertips.\n\nDemo accounts are similar to a practice run; they are ideal for novices to see the waters without jumping in too deep. Additionally, you may trade anytime, anywhere with mobile trading apps, which function like a portable trading desk. When you have these tools at your disposal, you're dealing wisely rather than merely for gold.\n\nPsychological aspects of trading\n\nManaging your emotions is just as important to success in the gold market as analyzing data. Imagine this: The fluctuations in the market have the power to arouse greed and anxiety more quickly than a rollercoaster.\n\nYou need a well-thought-out plan and a disciplined approach to stay consistent. Consider it as your mental fitness regimen, similar to preparing for a marathon: mindfulness and stress reduction. By maintaining your composure, you're learning the skill of emotional intelligence in trading, not only trading gold.\n\nLegal and regulatory considerations\n\nKeeping your capital secure and healthy is just as important as avoiding errors while navigating the legal environment of gold dealing. Consider it like being aware of the traffic laws prior to embarking on an exciting journey.\n\nA plethora of bureaucracy exists in regulations, ranging from taxation and reporting to trading limitations and all in between. Remain educated and, when in doubt, get advice. By abiding by the regulations, you not only safeguard your nest egg but also contribute to the proper operation of the financial system.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nStarting a gold trading business is similar to going on a treasure hunt: it's thrilling and may be quite profitable.\n\nYou'll be able to confidently negotiate the ups and downs of the gold market by grasping the fundamentals, fusing technical expertise with fundamental understanding, and developing a solid trading strategy.\n\nIt's important to maintain composure while emotions are running high in addition to crunching data.",

        "body": "Days before the gloom - the water cannons, and the young protesters shot in the head - Ann Kinuthia-Otieno, Chief Executive of Airtel Money walks onto the rooftop of Emara Ole Sereni in Nairobi. A petite lady, you can immediately tell she\u2019s (to use an apt analogy of the moment) a bullet; straight-shooting, driven, and determined.\n\nShe left Absa Bank as a head of products to run Airtel\u2019s mobile business after it split from Airtel Networks a few years ago to operate as a standalone business. And she comes at a tough time to do business\u2014hell, tough time to just be alive\u2014as a challenger brand. Even more daunting is that she faces a herculean task in the form of mobile money dominance.\n\nNonetheless, not one to complain, Ann\u2019s been working her hide off. Over time, she has tripled the daily transaction limits and significantly reduced its pay bill, bulk payments, and wallet-to-bank charges. The subscribers of Airtel Mobile Money have gone up.\n\n\u201cToday people don\u2019t think much about Airtel Money, but one day they will.\u201d She promises. \u201cWe have covered good ground but the runaway is still long.\u201d\n\n[Earlier, we were discussing parenting before the interview officially commenced.]\n\nYou never know immediately the impact of your parenting until much later...\n\nThere is something growing up that influenced the person that you are today. And these things can either be taken positively or not. Generally, you never know, as a parent, if your decisions were the right ones...\n\nUntil the end\u2026\n\nUntil the end. But again, I think there are cues that sometimes we don't take in or choose to ignore. So, for instance, I was in boarding school with my sister with whom I shared a birthday, the same month, same date, but we are two years apart. She's my elder. We were in State House Girls High School and my parents, for some reason, used to visit us and bring things in odd numbers for us to share. It was frustrating because if you bring seven items, someone will get less. But they let us figure it out ourselves. What that taught us is about sharing, being fair. But it didn\u2019t come easy because you know how siblings can get. When I think about where my sense of fairness came from, it's from there.\n\nWhat do you find harder; parenting or leadership?\n\nParenting. With children you have the pressure of creating a legacy, an impact that has implications on generations to come. It\u2019s a big responsibility. The corporate world is different in that if I leave this job tomorrow, nobody will care about me. There will be someone else doing my job. With your children, it\u2019s a different ball game because everything matters and it will shape their future.\n\nWhat are you struggling with today?\n\nMy struggle today is Airtel Money. It\u2019s a challenger brand that I need to grow. My late dad taught me a very important lesson that has stayed with me: whatever it is that you do, give it your very best so that nobody can come and do it after you. The sense of perfectionism comes from him.\n\nGrowing the brand is difficult, especially in a market where there's a dominant player and so that keeps me awake at night, thinking about what we can do to create impact and make a difference. I\u2019ve been in the role for two years and every day I wake up to ask if I have made a difference. We have grown our customer base six times since I joined. It's been blood, sweat, and tears with the team.\n\nWhat have you done lately that you were very proud of?\n\nProfessionally? The interoperability made possible with the help of the regulator, after five years, has enabled our customers to pay their bills online through the competitor\u2019s paybill number.\n\nOn a more personal front, just the impact on my younger children\u2019s lives - they are 10 and 12. Last year we had a bet with my two girls and I told them if they win academic awards, I would buy them a dog. And I don\u2019t like dogs at all. I think they are good to look at from afar. Anyway, they both got academic awards. So we had to get a dog and it's growing on me. It's a golden retriever - very playful, very friendly. It\u2019s destroying my flowers and I love gardening. It\u2019s taught my girls more responsibility even though they cook for themselves and stuff. This morning the dog messed up my flowers again and one of them she said,\"Maybe we can train the dog that it's not supposed to eat flowers\". I told her, \"You figure it out, it\u2019s your dog\".\n\nAre you living your life the way you want to?\n\nI pray so, yeah, because you don't have two chances. And losing both my parents taught me that - even though they lived to their 70s - life is short. The key is to create an impact on my family and my job. My dad was very disciplined; everday, five in the morning, he was in the office. He had such a high level of integrity. He used to tell us, \"You should be like Caesar's wife; above reproach\". He was very passionate and I think I take after him.\n\nI tend to be like a dog with a bone. I just go and refuse to give up. My boss says I'm like a woodpecker [Chuckles]. My mom was a teacher and after she retired, she started her school. She was hardworking and very friendly and extroverted. I got my father\u2019s genes. I look like him as well. He died of cancer after fighting it for seven years. He used to tell us, \"If you choose any cancer, have leukaemia. He had MCL (mantle cell lymphoma). Mom's symptoms started showing three months before she died. They died three years apart.\n\nAre you scared of cancer seeing as they both died of it?\n\nYeah, I mean, we all are, but you can't live life being scared. We all have to exit. The key thing is, what are you doing with the time that you have? What impact are you creating? Because at the end of the day, I believe God is just going to ask you, \"What have you done with the life that I've given you?\" My mom knew she had six months to live but she lived her life fully until the last day. So one has to live their life.\n\nDo you see yourself in your 60s, which is traditionally when people slow down and retire?\n\nI don\u2019t think I will retire. I plan to keep my mind engaged. I worked in the banking sector for two decades and looked at corporate deals across Africa because I worked in South Africa for two years and then came back and looked after SMEs and then moved to retail. That\u2019s a lot of learning and experience which I intend to use in consulting in my 60s. Maybe also sit on boards. I also love making social impact. God has given me so much and I shouldn't wait to be 60 to give back. It\u2019s something I\u2019m continually doing now outside work.\n\nWhat do you do outside work, outside family?\n\nChurch. I\u2019m passionate about making a difference. I got to the International Christian Centre. I was a deacon there at some point. Now my husband is a deacon. I also sit on a board at Pangani Girls. I head the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nWhen did you start serving the Lord?\n\nWhen I was in Form two. I used to have these recurring dreams where the world was ending and I'd be rushing to church, only to be told it's too late. One evening, I felt a very strong sense of presence, and I knew it couldn't be ordinary. Nobody talked to me. Nobody. You know, the way people now say they were led to Christ and stuff like that. No. For me, it was just at that moment\u2019s decision. I interpreted my dreams as a bigger calling that I heeded. Since then God has been a central part of my life. My leadership journey has been shaped by bibilical teachings. I constantly go back and read the Bible for encouragement in every sphere of my life.\n\nWhich is harder, leading people in church or at the workplace?\n\n[Chuckles] Being a deacon is like being a board member. It\u2019s an oversight role. People come to church to receive encouragement while in the office people\u2019s job is to create returns for the shareholder. People in church are more forgiving and they will take you in stride. The corporate world is more challenging, and that's why you go to church, right? To get more encouragement. [Chuckles]\n\nAnn Kinuthia-Otieno, Airtel Money CEO at a past company event. Photo credit: Francis Nderitu | Nation Media Group\n\nDid you meet Mr Otieno in church?\n\nNo, I met him when I was a corporate manager at Barclays, now Absa. So he's a financial consultant and there was a deal that he was doing and I was a corporate credit analyst. He's the deacon in the church, responsible for the finance docket.\n\nWhat did you learn about his people that surprised someone like you who comes from a different tribe?\n\n[Laughs] The unity of their family. Us Kikuyus can be individualistic sometimes. I think capitalism is very strong in Kikuyuland. I was surprised at the sense of unity in their village in Rongo, Migori. People just come to your home and are welcomed, people stay with each other\u2026I found that very refreshing.\n\nWhat's your extravagance?",

        "title": "Trific CEO Brenda Mbathi unveils investment plan after Two Rivers SEZ licence",
        "body": "In June 2023, listed investment firm Centum received a special economic zone (SEZ) licence covering 64 of the 106 acres of its Two Rivers development in Nairobi.\n\nA year down the road, the firm has announced a Sh6.1 billion funding package for the SEZ, which is known as the Two Rivers International Finance and Innovation Centre (Trific), from Africa-focused fund manager Vantage Capital.\n\nTrific chief executive Brenda Mbathi spoke to the Business Daily on the company\u2019s investment plan for the centre with the new capital injection, and the uptake of space at the facility over the past year.\n\nHow do you intend to deploy the new investment?\n\nOut of the investment from Vantage Capital, Sh2 billion will be allocated for acquiring and fitting out the Trific North Tower. This 14,975 square metre property will serve as a cornerstone of our SEZ.\n\nThe remaining Sh4 billion will be used to develop an additional office tower offering 76,800 square metres of leasable space. This development will provide the necessary infrastructure to support the influx of SEZ enterprises and ensure we meet the demand for high-quality office space.\n\nThe design and functionality of the new tower will reflect our commitment to creating a world-class business environment, setting a new benchmark for commercial properties in the region.\n\nWhat are the terms of the funding? Is it debt or equity investment?\n\nThe funding from Vantage Capital is structured as a mezzanine finance investment. This type of funding combines elements of both debt and equity, providing us with the capital required while being less dilutive to our shareholders than pure equity. It allows us to maintain a balanced financial structure, ensuring both stability and growth potential for Trific SEZ.\n\nMezzanine financing is particularly advantageous as it offers flexible terms and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the project. This flexibility is crucial for large-scale developments like Trific SEZ, where capital requirements vary significantly.\n\nBy utilising this kind of finance, we can optimise our capital structure, manage risks more effectively, and ensure the sustainability of our growth plans.\n\nHow many enterprises or organisations have signed up to the EPZ and what are their business focus area?\n\nTo date, 14 SEZ enterprises have signed up and secured space in the Trific North Tower. These enterprises operate across various sectors, including business processing outsourcing (BPO), shared services centres, regional headquarters, and investment holding corporations. Collectively, these enterprises are expected to create approximately 10,000 jobs and attract foreign direct investment amounting to about $65 million. The space is currently 70 percent committed by these enterprises in the Trific North Tower.\n\nWhat is your strategy for the SEZ now that you have the new funding?\n\nThe strategy is to leverage the new funding to enhance and expand our infrastructure, creating a more attractive and efficient environment for businesses.\n\nOur strategic location within Nairobi\u2019s prestigious diplomatic blue zone provides access to key markets and international business hubs. The SEZ framework in Kenya also offers various strategic incentives, including fiscal tax incentives, which are critical in reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability for businesses operating within Trific SEZ.\n\nTrific SEZ, therefore, offers an ecosystem designed to provide businesses with a competitive edge. This includes world-class infrastructure, advanced technology, and a regulatory framework conducive to business growth.\n\nBy fostering an integrated live-work-play ecosystem, we aim to attract a diverse range of businesses and talent, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to thrive.\n\nThe Kenya Finance Bill 2024 has proposed to exempt property transfers within an SEZ from capital gains tax. What would be the impact of such an exemption on the competitiveness of Kenyan SEZs?\n\nThe exemption from capital gains tax on property transfers within an SEZ that was proposed in the Finance Act was essentially a clarification, as capital gains tax exemption is already allowed within the SEZ Act and it is a significant financial benefit for special economic zones.\n\nThis exemption creates a more attractive investment environment for current and potential SEZ enterprises. By reducing the financial barriers associated with property transfers, we can facilitate smoother and more efficient transactions, encouraging more businesses to establish and expand their operations within the SEZ space.\n\nThis financial flexibility is crucial in maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring the long-term success of SEZs in Kenya.",

        "title": "Huge debts choking efforts to revive distressed companies",
        "body": "Kenya\u2019s financially distressed companies are grappling to secure a lifeline through \u2018administration\u2019 owing to their debts and late implementation of recovery measures, which pushed them into liquidation.\n\nAn administration process involves appointing an administrator to run a distressed company for one year with a possibility of extension by the court or selling it as a going concern to enhance its value for the benefit of its creditors.\n\nPlacing a firm under administration helps to regain control when it has serious cash flow problems, is insolvent, and faces threats from creditors. This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.\n\nData by the Office of the Official Receiver shows petitions for company liquidations are on the rise and have hit 30 since July 2023, highlighting the extent of financial distress facing businesses due to economic downturn and governance-related issues.\n\nAdministrators say keeping distressed companies as a going concern is becoming difficult because of debts that cannot be repaid within the \u2018administration period\u2019 of up to 18 months, citing the collapsed retail chain Nakumatt that went under with an estimated Sh38 billion worth of claims.\n\nLiquidation (or winding up) is the process by which a company\u2019s existence is terminated by selling its assets to pay off its debts. Any money remaining after all debts, expenses, and costs have been paid off is distributed among the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nSince the introduction of the administration process in 2015, Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, ARM Cement Plc. and Deacons Plc were the first to go through the process, with hopes that their recovery would set a positive trend for other companies likely to undergo the same process.\n\nHowever, these companies failed to survive the administration process, paving the way for their liquidation.\n\n\u201cThese companies are heavily indebted. They can\u2019t come out of that big hole. So, what we have been doing is trying to sell those assets to somebody who can buy them and put them to use because you find that by the time the company has gone that route, it can take them long to recover. I give an example of Nakumatt with Sh38 billion debt, which you can\u2019t expect to recover. No bank will give you more money to pay that,\u201d says Peter Kahi, a partner at PKF Consulting (K) Ltd.\n\n\u201cSo we look at options. The first option is to see whether we can rescue that company, the second option is to try and maximise the returns for all creditors so that at least they get something, and if you can\u2019t achieve the third option is to sell the assets to pay for preferential creditors and other claims. Most administrators have been going for option two or option three.\u201d\n\nThe number of petitions for liquidation of companies presented to court has more than doubled in the last nine years. Even after the new Insolvency Act (2015) introduced a provision for an \u2018administration process\u2019 to give a chance to financially troubled firms to put their houses in order and revert to the recovery path.\n\nPetitions for liquidations by the court rose to 30 in the 2023-24 fiscal year (July-June) from 13 petitions in the 2015-16 fiscal year (July-June), while the number of companies pushed into voluntary liquidation increased to nine from five in the same period.\n\nAbout 22 companies were put under liquidation through direct appointment in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Office of the Official Receiver.\n\n\u201cI can say these companies don\u2019t go into liquidation but somebody else comes to make better use of their assets because if you continue running that company how many years will it take you to pay off Sh38 billion debt because the administrators\u2019 period is 12 months with the first extension of maybe six months and that is what the law says,\u201d says Mr Kahi.\n\nKen Gichinga, a Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says recovery of companies under administration requires a combination of administration and managerial expertise to be able tackle deal with problems related to the weak macroeconomic environment and the \u2018trust deficit\u2019 reputation crisis occasioned by the \u2018receivership\u2019 tag.\n\n\u201cCompanies in receivership have to fight two battles which are a weak economic environment and the trust deficit battle associated with the high risk profile of companies in receivership. So you will find that the appointed administrators of these companies (in administration) end up fighting two battles instead of one battle and that is the reason it has been that hard to revive these companies,\u201d says Mr Gichinga.\n\n\u201c From the word \u2018administrator, the administrators\u2019 main concern is to keep the companies in administration as a \u2018going concern\u2019 but what these companies really need is almost a double level of management trend to be able to navigate this weak macroeconomic environment and to win the confidence of the customers. What we need is administrators working together with management gurus to revive these companies.\u201d\n\nAdministrators say that normally they are called upon when companies are in the \u2018intensive Care Unit (ICU)\u2019 with nothing to salvage as most assets have been stripped by the directors. These companies are going through a crisis in which they cannot meet their debt obligations, salaries are in arrears, auctioneers are calling at the doors of the company, the tax man is calling and critical supplies such as electricity have been disconnected.\n\n\u201cThere are three objectives of any administration. Reviving a company is the first and depends to a large extent on the state of the company at the point of the intervention,\u201d George Weru, a Business Recovery Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said in an earlier interview.\n\n\u201cIf the intervention is too late when the distress is very significant this is not practical. The administrator proceeds to the next objective which is to sell the business as a going concern. This ensures continuity of the business and saves jobs which to me is still a success.\u201d\n\nUnder the Insolvency law, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it fails to pay a debt of Sh100, 000 or more after 21 days of a written demand being served upon it.\n\nAccording to a law firm Maina & Onsare Partners Advocates LLP the process of administration is intended to offer breathing space for insolvent companies while availing better returns and packages for creditors which are not ordinarily available in liquidation.\n\n\u201cIt also gives Companies going through financial turmoil an opportunity to put their acts together. This allows them to continue operating instead of the earlier practice of abruptly killing them as was the case in the previous statutes (now repealed),\u201d the law firm says on its website.\n\n\u201cIt is an alternative rescue process which leads to a stay of past and future legal proceedings as envisaged by Section 560 & 561 of the Insolvency Act hence making it cheaper for the company.\u201d\n\nUp until 2015, a company in financial distress was met often with the liquidation culture triggered by voluntarily or by a creditor or subject to the court's supervision.",

It also shows that they have lower ticket prices per deal compared to DFI and merger/acquisition transactions.\n\nRegarding geographical distribution of deals, Kenya accounted for 40 out of the region\u2019s total of 59 deals, followed by Uganda at seven deals, Rwanda and Tanzania at five deals each, and Ethiopia at two transactions.",

That spurred the government, in the 2024/25 Budget, to outline a raft of tax increases in a bid to get its fiscal consolidation plans back on track.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury data shows taxes grew at a slower rate of 10.83 percent year-on-year to Sh1.93 trillion than that in non-debt recurrent expenditure in the 11 months ended May.\n\nThe Ruto administration\u2019s plan to make up for slower growth in taxes than expenditure through Finance Bill 2024 was this week thwarted by youth-led demonstrators who poured onto the streets of cities and major towns countrywide saying additional taxes will exacerbate an already unbearable cost of living.\n\nDr Ruto was banking on the new taxes which targeted Sh346 billion in new revenue and expenditure cuts largely targeting non-essential expenditures such as hospitality and renovation of offices as well as slashing allocations for Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies to place the country on the path to a balanced budget by year 2027.\n\nAnalysts have, however, insisted that Kenya has an \u201cexpenditure problem and not a tax problem\u201d, indicating that the government needs to tame its spend further to achieve a balanced budget where borrowing is kept at minimal levels.\n\nInternational Budget Partnership's Country Manager for Kenya Abraham Rugo has cited supplementary budgets to cater for expenses that were not initially budgeted as the main driver of non-debt expenditures.\n\n\u201cGovernments are meant to exist and deliver services perpetuity which means that as the size of government grows, recurrent expenditures are likely to increase indefinitely,\u201d Dr Rugo said.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not mean that there are no wastages or inefficiencies in the public sector that drive a wedge between productivity and compensation (wages).\u201d\n\nState House, which has been undergoing a major renovation this financial year, has been the largest beneficiary of mini-budgets. Treasury data shows expenditure at the State House had exceeded the original full-year budget by about half (49.20 percent) in the 11-month through May to Sh9.5 billion.",

I say this because there is a feeling you get when you walk in there, through all those shelves upon shelves of bottles of wine. It\u2019s like walking through an aquarium of alcohol.\n\nYou feel giddy with anticipation even if you don\u2019t care too much about wine. Maybe this feeling is further complemented by the usage of wood. And lighting. It\u2019s all in the simplicity and the flow. Anyhow, whatever it is, a beer to the interior stylist.\n\nI recently sat with a friend in one of those raised tables inside, the one facing the short bar and the back entrance. Cosy little corner, too cosy to be wasted discussing politics. My friend is a typical middle-class who has never teared up from teargas but complains about the state of our governance. She also feels like going to protest is too \u201cdangerous.\u201d That tear gas might get into her hair. (Great hair, I will admit).\n\nThis is a malady that has afflicted us and our parents; taking it on the chin, turning the other cheek. It was my first ever protest and after that, I was calling out all my friends who think protests are for \u201cother people.\u201d I realise that I was quite insufferable.\n\nAnyway, Wine Bar (no fault of theirs) felt like the kind of place people who have never sniffed teargas would gather to talk about teargas and violence.

        "body": "Kenya has long been a focal point for business opportunities in East Africa.\n\nHowever, the current economic landscape poses several challenges, which businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), must navigate skillfully.\n\nHigh interest rates, high taxation, and fluctuations in disposable income have created a complex environment, demanding strategic thinking and adaptability from entrepreneurs.\n\nThe financial strain caused by these factors has not only affected the bottom line of SMEs but has also restricted their capacity for growth. Evolving consumer spending patterns further compound the situation.\n\nTo weather these economic challenges, businesses must explore diverse revenue and income streams.\n\nProduct diversification in alignment with market needs and expanding the capacities of SMEs are critical strategies. Understanding the market landscape and consumer demands will enable businesses to tailor their offerings to include complementary goods or services that align with their core competencies.\n\nDiversifying within one\u2019s expertise not only leverages existing client relationships but also establishes new revenue streams. Ancillary offers, such as maintenance services and personalised consultations, exemplify this approach.\n\nGeographical expansion is another formidable strategy. The exploration of untapped markets, whether regional or global and the tailoring of offerings to meet the diverse needs of consumer segments positions SMEs to flourish in various economic landscapes.\n\nMeanwhile, in today\u2019s rapidly evolving business environment, the cost structure of SMEs is crucial for sustainability. Digitisation and automation offer significant opportunities for streamlining operations and reducing costs. Embracing technology not only enhances efficiency but also opens up new delivery channels like e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach wider audiences, and adapt to changing consumer behaviours.\n\nWhile access to working capital remains a pressing issue for SMEs, collaborative efforts between financial institutions, government bodies, and private sector stakeholders can pave the way for more accessible and affordable financing solutions.\n\nFinally, the importance of benchmarking and networking cannot be overstated. SMEs can leverage partnerships with organisations such as the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to access valuable resources, mentorship, and business intelligence. Strategic partnerships may generate synergies that open doors to new clients, distribution channels, and revenue streams.\n\nForums and industry events provide a platform for networking, knowledge exchange, and identifying potential collaborations.",

        "body": "Rishi Sunak abandoned his \u201clegacy\u201d policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.\n\nThe UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak\u2019s place in British political history.\n\nAn investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK\u2019s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year.\n\nAfter months of fierce opposition from the industry \u2013 and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms \u2013 the proposal was excluded from the \u201cwash-up\u201d process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop.\n\nThe policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2009, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it.\n\nDocuments and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world\u2019s largest tobacco firms \u2013 the UK\u2019s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) \u2013 put ministers on notice of a legal backlash.\n\nImperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was \u201cunlawful\u201d because industry views had not been considered.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies.\n\nView image in fullscreen Imperial Brands sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK. Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nThe Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were \u201cnecessary\u201d.\n\nImperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a \u201cjudicial review\u201d challenging the consultation process.\n\nGovernment lawyers responded by saying legal action might \u201cderail\u201d a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.\n\nBAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial\u2019s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.\n\nImperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was \u201ckeeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments\u201d.\n\nThe legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.\n\nPMI\u2019s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s UK subsidiary told the consultation it \u201cdid not support the age of sale ban as outlined\u201d, arguing instead for \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d on \u201ccombustible tobacco\u201d \u2013 ie cigarettes \u2013 instead of an outright ban.\n\nPMI told the Guardian the bill risked \u201cconfusing\u201d consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it \u201cfirmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK\u201d.\n\nBAT, which has previously advocated for a \u201csmokeless\u201d future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.\n\nAs the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a \u201cbusiness lunch\u201d with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company\u2019s annual party at the British Museum in London.\n\nIn May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak\u2019s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,\u201d JTI said.

The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the \u201copen dismissal of industry views in the decision making process\u201d.\n\nIts secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of \u201ctaking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness\u201d.\n\nA month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: \u201cThe principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one \u2026 We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.\u201d\n\nTwo Conservative MPs, including Badenoch\u2019s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved.\n\nThe Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a \u201cnanny state\u201d measure.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Sunak \u2018nanny state\u2019 beermat. Illustration: Howard McWilliam\n\nBadenoch\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch\u2019s department to join Imperial in January.\n\nStafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a \u201clover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information\u201d.\n\nHe and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group\u2019s position in a speech.\n\nThe government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.\n\nIn total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.\n\nBAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: \u201cWe are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative party did not return requests for comment.",

        "body": "Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a \u201ccostly mistake\u201d by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election.\n\nThe Indian owner of the vast south Wales steelworks said on Thursday that it intended to cease operations at two blast furnaces on the site by 7 July \u2013 three days after the general election \u2013 in response to strike action announced by Unite members from 8 July. The company had planned to shut one furnace by the end of June and a second by September.\n\nAbout 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata\u2019s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.\n\nThe company said: \u201cWe cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action.\u201d\n\nA Tata Steel spokesperson called on Unite to cancel the industrial action and said it had began legal action to \u201cchallenge the validity of Unite\u2019s ballot\u201d. Tata called on Unite to consider \u201cthe company\u2019s proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training, and skills development\u201d.\n\nThe decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday\u2019s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, have pledged up to \u00a33bn to support the industry\u2019s transition to low carbon steel production, which is expected to include honouring an existing \u00a3500m package of government support for Port Talbot. A new electric arc furnace will be built by the end of 2027.\n\nTorsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank who is standing as Labour candidate for Swansea West, said on X that Tata\u2019s decision was \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cSafety is of course paramount but Tata should avoid taking any action that cannot be reversed before seeing the result of the general election.\n\n\u201cWe need to see everyone getting round the table. It is crucial we don\u2019t lose the chance for the company and unions to sit down with an incoming Labour government, given the commitment from [Reynolds] and [Reeves] to a \u00a32.5bn steel renewal fund.\u201d\n\nOnay Kasab, Unite\u2019s national lead officer, said the union had asked for a meeting to discuss how to operate the site safely during the industrial action \u2013 the first steel strikes in 40 years \u2013 since it was called last week. He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.\n\nKasab said: \u201cTo issue that statement last night knowing full well the meeting was today \u2013 it\u2019s about trying to create fear and uncertainty among the workforce. Safety is paramount. Our argument is that the blast furnace does not have to be turned off before the electric arc furnace comes on, so of course we are not going to take action which means it is turned off.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the decision-makers in Mumbai to get involved in the discussions and we want Labour to stick to their commitment.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reynolds needs to sit down with the company to see to quickly put things in place.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, when launching Labour\u2019s election campaign in Wales last month, said he would \u201cfight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales\u201d.\n\nVaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: \u201cWe will not support the closure of both furnaces. This will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. He added: \u201cUrgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: \u201cTata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out.\n\n\u201cA better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake.\n\n\u201cIt will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "The board of Thames Water agreed to pay a \u00a3150m dividend hours before its shareholders U-turned on plans to pump emergency funding into the struggling water supplier, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe water industry regulator was examining the decision by the debt-laden company\u2019s board to sign off the payout at a meeting on 27 March, sources said.\n\nThe following day, the company said an imminent \u00a3500m injection of funds that had been pledged by its investors would not be paid, amid a standoff with Ofwat. That decision threatens to tip Britain\u2019s water company into public hands, with Whitehall officials war-gaming its temporary renationalisation.\n\nOfwat planned to investigate the circumstances around the dividend paid by Thames, sources said. At the time, Thames was already under investigation over its decision to pay a separate \u00a337.5m dividend.\n\nThames Water\u2019s fate is one of the biggest issues facing the next government, with the company labouring under \u00a315.6bn of debt, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse.\n\nThames said it was too early to know what the outcome of Ofwat\u2019s inquiries into the dividend payment would be.\n\nThe company, which has a complex corporate structure, said the payment was made from the regulated company to an intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, to \u201csettle a pension top-up payment\u201d and \u201csurrender relief\u201d on tax losses.\n\nIn March the company and its shareholders drew heavy criticism when investors refused to pay \u00a3500m of promised funding. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said the leadership of the company had been a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\n\nIn December the Guardian revealed that Ofwat was examining a \u00a337.5m dividend paid from its regulated operating company to its ultimate owner, Kemble.\n\nWhile the \u00a3150m payout did not go to Thames shareholders, Ofwat has been clamping down on the flow of cash from ringfenced water companies to holding companies, amid concerns that payouts are weakening the finances of regulated water and sewerage firms.\n\nIn May 2023 it modified the conditions of water companies\u2019 licences to stipulate that companies must explain how dividend decisions were made and how they \u201creflect overall performance, alongside investment and financial resilience needs\u201d. The regulator can take action where a company has failed to meet the conditions.\n\nThis month it emerged that Ofwat was considering fining the company \u00a340m over the \u00a337.5m payment on the grounds that it breached those rules on dividends. Sources close to the situation said a final decision on that possible fine was unlikely to be published before the regulator rules on water companies\u2019 five-year spending plans next month.\n\nOfwat is due to publish its draft response to water companies\u2019 business plans on 11 July, after a delay caused by the general election. Thames\u2019s annual results need to be published by 15 July.\n\nThe company, which serves about 16m households, faces the prospect of a potential special administration, handled by the government, if it cannot raise fresh funds from investors. Officials are drawing up contingency plans for a temporary nationalisation under the codename Project Timber.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These transactions were cash and reserves neutral for Thames Water Utilities Limited, which is the regulated business, and increased the company\u2019s financial resilience.\n\n\u201cOfwat does not assert any potential breach by Thames Water of its licence and it is too early to know the outcome of Ofwat\u2019s enquiries in relation to this matter.\u201d\n\nThames said its ultimate shareholders, which include the Canadian pension fund Omers and the British university staff pension scheme USS, had not received a dividend since 2017 and it did not plan an \u201cexternal dividend\u201d until 2030.\n\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cWe await the company to disclose its financial report including any dividend. We have new powers to act against companies paying dividends that do not reflect companies\u2019 performance for customers and the environment or which compromise financial resilience, and we will use them as appropriate.\u201d\n\nA downgrade by the credit ratings agencies Moody\u2019s and S&P in April meant Thames Water could not pay dividends without breaching its licence.\n\nThe water industry has faced mounting anger from politicians and the public over repeated sewage spills into Britain\u2019s waterways during a period in which it has made significant payments to investors and handed executives large bonuses.",

Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.\n\nThe data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.\n\nReal household disposable income \u2013 how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation \u2013 is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.\n\nThe strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.\n\nRishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable income per head \u2013 were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.\n\nDespite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person \u00a3120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.\n\nAdam Corlett, the thinktank\u2019s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.\n\nThe UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.\n\nHowever, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning \u2013 bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years.

        "body": "In February 2020, with the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader heating up, Keir Starmer\u2019s office received a helping hand.\n\nPeter Coates, the head of the dynasty behind Stoke-based online gambling company Bet365, donated \u00a325,000 to Starmer\u2019s office.\n\nCoates and the Bet365 group had been regular donors to Labour until 2015, to the tune of \u00a3490,000, but the money dried up in the Corbyn years, when Bet365 turned its attention to stopping Brexit, handing \u00a3512,500 to the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU.\n\nThe donation was a clear sign that the gambling industry spigot could easily be turned on again.\n\nNow, of the 12 most recent political donations by the industry and its executives, all have gone to Labour \u2013 a total of just under \u00a3400,000 stretching back to March 2020 \u2013 according to Electoral Commission records.\n\nBut that river of cash does not just indicate Labour\u2019s position as the likely winner of the 4 July general election. It also illustrates the deep-rooted ties between the Labour party and the \u00a311bn-a-year gambling sector.\n\nIn the past few weeks, revelations about bets apparently placed on the date of the election by Conservative politicians have prompted anger about an apparent problem with gambling infecting politics.\n\nThe furore has overshadowed the fact that, at the time the election was called, the Tory government was proceeding with its long-awaited white paper on gambling regulation.\n\nWith the future of those plans likely to be left in the hands of a Labour government, there are question marks over whether it is Labour, rather than the Conservatives, that has a gambling problem.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carolyn Harris has been one of few within the Labour party to have pushed for tougher regulation. Photograph: UK parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA\n\n\u201cThe stage is set for a proper public health approach to gambling policy,\u201d said Matt Zarb-Cousin, a gambling reform activist and former spokesperson for Corbyn. \u201cThe only thing stopping Labour going much further than the Tories on this issue will be the influence of the gambling lobby.\u201d\n\nIn its manifesto, published in early June, Labour talked tough, declaring itself \u201ccommitted to reducing gambling-related harm\u201d.\n\nThat task, in extreme cases the difference between life and death, will most likely fall to Stephanie Peacock, the shadow gambling minister.\n\nHer predecessor as Labour\u2019s MP for Barnsley East, Michael Dugher, is now the chair of the industry lobby group, the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC).\n\nHe and Peacock appear to be close, regularly congratulating one another on each other\u2019s political and personal achievements via social media.\n\nThe revolving door between Labour and the BGC does not stop at Dugher.\n\nThe lobby group has also employed the former Labour MP Anna Turley as a sports consultant, while its director of corporate affairs, Gary Follis, was an adviser to the erstwhile Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Turley, who lost her Redcar seat in 2019, is campaigning to be re-elected in the north-east constituency.\n\nDugher remains close to his friend and former colleague Tom Watson.\n\nAs the Labour deputy leader, Watson regularly denounced the worst excesses of the gambling industry, calling for more stringent regulation.\n\nUpon leaving politics, he took a job as an adviser to Paddy Power, a company he had previously denounced as both \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cmoney-grabbing\u201d after it offered odds on the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp.\n\nThen there are those donations. Labour is not alone in taking money from gambling companies \u2013 the Done brothers behind Betfred gave \u00a3375,000 to the Tories in 2016 and 2017.\n\nBut most of the industry\u2019s generosity has been bestowed on the party of opposition.\n\nSince 2015, prominent Labour MPs have received nearly \u00a330,000 from Red Capital Ltd, an investment vehicle owned by Jonathan Mendelsohn, the Labour peer.\n\nView image in fullscreen Michael Dugher, a former MP for Barnsley East, is now the chair of the Betting & Gaming Council lobby group. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nHe is also the chair of Evoke Holdings, which owns the William Hill, Mr Green and 888 gambling brands.\n\nRecipients of Red Capital\u2019s largesse include the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (\u00a35,000) and the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting (\u00a35,000). The party itself pocketed \u00a314,500.\n\nRichard Flint, a former chief executive of Leeds-based Sky Betting & Gaming, gave Labour \u00a325,000 in 2021, as well as \u00a310,000 to Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor and candidate for Leeds West who has held the seat since 2010.\n\nReeves also received \u00a310,000 that year from Neil Goulden, then a director of Gamesys, the owner of Virgin Games and Rainbow Riches Casino.\n\nBetween them, gambling companies who have donated to Labour, or whose senior staff have done so, have paid out almost \u00a340m to the Gambling Commission in the past three years for licence breaches including failure to protect problem gamblers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Others, however, require secondary legislation and must now be left up to Labour.\n\nThese include a statutory levy to fund addiction research, education and treatment, as well as the introduction of a new ombudsman.\n\nThe volume of gambling advertising in British society also remains an open question, one that campaigners said was wrongly omitted from the white paper.\n\nSome observers have said they are wary of the tone of Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge and what it means for unresolved regulatory questions.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the industry on how to ensure responsible gambling,\u201d the party said, prompting a letter to the Guardian from academics concerned about industry influence.\n\nLiz Ritchie, of the charity Gambling With Lives, hopes reformists will also get their foot in the door at Westminster.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are very hopeful that a Labour government would listen to families bereaved by gambling suicide and learn from the catastrophic failures of regulation, public information and treatment that has characterised the industry-controlled system to date.\u201d\n\nLabour declined to comment further about its gambling policy plans or relationship with the industry.\n\nBut for those who believe that money buys influence, reformists appear to be on manoeuvres too.\n\nFew people gave more to Labour last year than the little-known former casino entrepreneur Derek Webb. He has previously thrown his weight behind reform, including legal support for Gambling With Lives and the successful campaign to curb fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).\n\nWebb gave \u00a3300,000 to Labour in 2023, nearly as much as anything the party has had from gambling tycoons.\n\nPeacock declined to comment.",

In one internal email, a PMJ employee claimed they had been told \u201cto keep it a secret\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Philip Morris's IQOS devices at a shop in Tokyo. A tobacco industry watchdog said PMI appeared to have lobbied for IQOS to be permitted where smoking was banned. Photograph: Akio Kon/Getty\n\nThe paper, published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, is based on 24 leaked company documents, dated from between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThese activities resemble known strategies to influence the conduct, publication and reach of science, and conceal scientific activities,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nDr Sophie Braznell, one of its authors, said: \u201cThe manipulation of science for profit harms us all, especially policymakers and consumers trying to make potentially life-changing decisions. It slows down and undermines public health policies, while encouraging the widespread use of harmful products.\u201d\n\nBraznell said the leaked documents undermined claims made by PMI to conduct \u201ctransparent science\u201d, and called for reforms to the funding and governance of tobacco research \u201cto protect science from vested corporate interests\u201d.\n\nIn a separate report on the company\u2019s marketing activities, also based on leaked documents, Stop said PMJ appeared to lobby for IQOS to be permitted in places where smoking was banned.\n\nGroups including medical and hospitality groups, and Japan\u2019s Fire and Disaster Management Agency were all targeted for endorsements, \u201cwhich, if secured, could give the appearance of organic, widespread acceptance of IQOS\u201d, Stop said.\n\nAiming for a presence at the Tokyo Olympics \u201cechoes a known industry tactic of advertising addictive, harmful tobacco products at sports events \u2013 associating these products with health, misleading consumers, and reaching children and young people\u201d.\n\nJorge Alday, director at Stop, said the findings were at odds with PMI\u2019s statements suggesting IQOS was only targeted at adult smokers.\n\n\u201cPMI\u2019s intentions with IQOS seem to extend far beyond what they\u2019ve stated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis revelation adds weight to the mounting evidence questioning the credibility of PMI\u2019s claims about their intentions and their products.\n\n\u201cDisturbingly, it hints at a broader pattern of deceptive tactics, potentially laying the groundwork for a new chapter in the tobacco epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nA PMI spokesperson said: \u201cThis is yet another specious story from an organisation more interested in criticising our company than helping reduce the harm from cigarettes.\n\n\u201cLike any highly regulated, multinational company, PMI regularly seeks to share our positions on issues that affect our consumers, our company, and our communities.

        "body": "Uber and Lyft drivers will be guaranteed among the highest wages in the US for ride-share workers under a historic deal agreed with Massachusetts prosecutors.\n\nAndrea Campbell, the state\u2019s attorney general, and the two companies agreed to a $175m settlement Thursday evening that requires a minimum pay floor of $32.50 per hour, and introduces a slew of other benefits and protections that drivers didn\u2019t already have.\n\nThe resolution to four years of litigation between the parties also resulted in a settlement of $174m to be paid by the companies: $148m from Uber and $27m from Lyft. Most will be distributed as restitution to current and former drivers who were underpaid by the companies. More information about who will qualify for those payments and how to file a claim will be released in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cFor years, these companies have underpaid their drivers and denied them basic benefits,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement holds Uber and Lyft accountable and provides their drivers, for the very first time in Massachusetts, guaranteed minimum pay, paid sick leave, occupational accident insurance and healthcare stipends.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts now joins New York, Minnesota, Washington, and other states in setting a minimum pay rate for drivers.\n\nDrivers will also benefit from access to paid sick leave if they work 15 hours weekly, as well as a stipend for health benefits and occupational accident insurance. They can accrue up to 40 hours annually of paid sick leave, which will be bought through stipends to buy into the state\u2019s program for paid family and medical leave.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft don\u2019t intend to pull out of Massachusetts and operations will continue. The changes will go into effect on 15 August and will be adjusted annually for inflation.\n\nEd Booth has been driving for Lyft for over seven years. He said he usually makes a lot more than the new floor for wages, but it depends on what hours he works and whether there\u2019s a surge of customers \u2013 like at 2am when youth leave closing bars.\n\n\u201cThen all of a sudden, you\u2019ll get all this cash windfall that will bring your average back up to somewhere around $40, $45,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described himself as an independent guy who has owned many businesses, including a current one in web development. \u201cI\u2019ve been treating this like my own business,\u201d he said, adding that he doesn\u2019t want any union involvement in the future.\n\n\u201cYou know, the health insurance, I\u2019m gonna take advantage of it,\u201d he said. He\u2019s \u201ca little bit\u201d concerned that many new drivers will sign up to take advantage of the hourly floor, creating more competition, but he\u2019s confident enough to handle it.\n\nJeremy Bird, Lyft executive vice president of driver experience, called the moment a \u201chuge win for Massachusetts drivers that secures their freedom to earn when, where and however long they want\u201d. He said on any given day, the flexible work on the Lyft platform provides an average of 8,500 drivers in Massachusetts independence to earn while attending school and caring for families.\n\nUber media relations referred the Guardian to a blogpost where Tony West, Uber chief legal officer, wrote that the agreement is \u201can example of what independent, flexible work with dignity should look like in the 21st century\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn taking this opportunity, we\u2019ve resolved historical liabilities by constructing a new operating model that balances both flexibility and benefits,\u201d West said.\n\nThe accord doesn\u2019t take a stance on the classification of drivers, allowing them to continue to act as contractors.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He often works 30 hours between Friday to Sunday as a driver.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, a massive victory for drivers. That delivers real advancements in terms of an earnings guarantee in terms of paid sick leave, health care and other important basic protections of employment law,\u201d he said. But he\u2019s disappointed because Campbell\u2019s office didn\u2019t \u201cpursue enforcement of the law here. There\u2019s no ruling on employment status.\u201d\n\nDrivers will be paid the minimum of $32.50, and will be able to make more \u2013 the wage will apply for when drivers are en route to pick up passengers or transporting them. Some drivers complained that the companies won\u2019t be required to pay for the time when they\u2019ve logged onto their apps, but haven\u2019t chosen a customer\u2019s ride request.\n\n\u201cBy setting the amount at $32.50, we were trying to account for the time the driver\u2019s are waiting as well,\u201d said Abby Taylor, Massachusetts deputy attorney general, who worked on the case.\n\nFor health insurance, drivers will be offered a \u201cpooled health insurance benefit\u201d for anyone who drives more than 15 hours per week, boiling down to an insurance stipend to pay for a plan through the state\u2019s health connector.\n\nThe agreement also allows an appeals process for drivers to push back on deactivations.\n\nThen attorney general, Maura Healey, who is now governor, launched the lawsuit in 2020, alleging the ride share companies were boosting their profits by treating drivers as contractors and denying them benefits that employees would receive.\n\n\u201cOur lawsuit against Uber and Lyft was always about fairness for drivers,\u201d she said Thursday night in a statement, calling the wages \u201chistoric\u201d and a benefit to \u201cright the wrongs of the past\u201d.",

        "title": "Labour\u2019s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation",
        "body": "As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss\u2019s government and its \u201cdash for growth\u201d in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.\n\nBuoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.\n\nIn short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy\u2019s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.\n\nThere is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.\n\nThe Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.\n\nLabour has indicated it would try to \u201chardwire\u201d many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt \u201crule\u201d as the current Conservative party.\n\nThe challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.\n\nOne must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nAnother, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country\u2019s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Grand corporate strategies are launched in weighty declarations by chief executives who fancy themselves as visionaries. That was how Bernard Looney, the then chief executive of BP, did it back in February 2020 when he said the company would get serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewables. \u201cThe direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back,\u201d Looney told his City audience.\n\nBy contrast, the watering down of ambition tends to happen in increments. Thus, when Looney last year scrapped BP\u2019s aim to reduce hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030, versus 2019\u2019s level, in favour of a 25% cut, he claimed the change was a case of \u201cleaning in\u201d to the same strategy, just in the new circumstance of a world that was worrying more about energy security after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnd now comes today\u2019s BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, with his own adjustment. This one is genuinely more of a tweak: BP will slow its investment in low-carbon projects, which mostly means offshore wind in this case. The intention \u2013 at least for now \u2013 is still to complete the 9.5GW of capacity in unbuilt off-shore projects in the UK, Germany and the US. But don\u2019t expect to see BP turbine blades start spinning until late in this decade, and don\u2019t expect the company to bid for more wind licences unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. The corporate game is now about delivering \u201ca simpler, more focused and higher value company\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chevron and ExxonMobil in the US, for example, are unembarrassed about their determination to be oily for longer. And BP is the only major to have a formal target to reduce oil and gas output. It is why Auchincloss can still maintain that his refrain about moving from \u201cIOC to IEC\u201d \u2013 from international oil company to integrated energy company \u2013 is intact.\n\nYet his next action will be the one to watch. The stock market, as everybody knows by now, is rewarding the US titans with higher share ratings because they have an easier financial story to tell: energy transition globally is happening at a slower pace than imagined a few years ago, and their expertise lies in oil and gas, where immediate demand is still high.\n\nBP, by contrast, is in \u201ctrust us\u201d financial territory for what it calls its \u201cfive transition growth engines\u201d, which also include biogas, electric vehicle charging points, hydrogen and \u2013 nonsensically \u2013 convenience stores on forecourts. Since it hasn\u2019t actually built any windfarms yet, it is not in position to demonstrate achieved returns. Therein lies its credibility issue with the market.\n\nSo where does Auchincloss go next? As the continuity choice for the top job, radical change was never on the cards in year one. But you have to wonder what year two will bring. Would anyone be surprised if BP\u2019s renewables ambitions were scaled back again? Increments add up, and Looney\u2019s \u201cno turning back\u201d mantra feels a long time ago.",
        "summary": "And now comes today\u2019s BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, with his own adjustment.\nThis one is genuinely more of a tweak: BP will slow its investment in low-carbon projects, which mostly means offshore wind in this case.\nAnd BP is the only major to have a formal target to reduce oil and gas output.\nIt is why Auchincloss can still maintain that his refrain about moving from \u201cIOC to IEC\u201d \u2013 from international oil company to integrated energy company \u2013 is intact.\nWould anyone be surprised if BP\u2019s renewables ambitions were scaled back again?",

        "body": "It is one of the oddities of this weirdest of election campaigns that the issue that helped give the Conservatives an 80-seat majority in 2019 has barely been mentioned. As far as the main parties are concerned, Brexit is a done deal. The decision has been made. Time to move on.\n\nTo be sure, much has happened since 2019, most notably a global pandemic, a cost of living crisis and the brief \u2013 yet drama-packed \u2013 premiership of Liz Truss. Making ends meet features more prominently in voters\u2019 lists of concerns than whether the UK should rejoin the single market.\n\nEven so, the fact that the UK left the EU since the last election matters. It matters because Brussels can no longer be blamed for the UK\u2019s problems or the failure of UK politicians to deal with them. The EU can\u2019t, for example, be fingered for record net migration numbers in 2022. Those are entirely due to decisions taken at Westminster. The likely scale of the Conservative defeat on 4 July will be the result of voters holding the government fully to account for rising prices, falling living standards and a failure to deliver on levelling up. There is no hiding place, and that\u2019s good. Many of those who voted leave in 2016 because they felt ignored and marginalised still feel ignored and marginalised. They gave the Tories a chance and they blew it.\n\nFrom next week, they will almost certainly be able to see whether Labour can make a better fist of things. Keir Starmer has been on quite a journey since he was the shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, pressing for a second referendum. He has not just ruled out rejoining the EU but has also said there will be no return to the single market or the customs union. Instead, Labour wants to smooth out the wrinkles by negotiating a better trade deal with the EU than the one Boris Johnson secured.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Starmer\u2019s fellow MPs and Labour party supporters have come on that journey with him, because for the most part they are solidly anti-Brexit and pro-EU. That has not always been the case, and there was a time in the 1970s and early 1980s when, under Tony Benn\u2019s influence, Labour was the more Eurosceptic of the two main parties.\n\nBut after Labour\u2019s drubbing at the 1983 election there was then a shift towards a more pro-EU stance amid hopes that Brussels-style socialism offered a way to circumvent the policies of Margaret Thatcher. To say the least, the party is not entirely comfortable with Starmer\u2019s decision to rule out rejoining the EU.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit strategy was summed up by Starmer on one of the few occasions the issue has surfaced during the campaign \u2013 a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson. \u201cIf you look at the problems for growth over the last 14 years, they were there, or many of them were there, before Brexit, so the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept.\u201d\n\nStarmer is right about this. The parts of the country that voted most strongly for leave were those that saw the sharpest rises in unemployment in the 1980s and the biggest increases in incapacity benefits as attempts were made to massage the jobless figures down. They had the heaviest reliance on the tax credits to top up poverty pay, and they bore the brunt of the welfare cuts introduced by George Osborne after 2010.\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted, progress towards the 2030 levelling up goals set in a 2022 white paper has been \u201cglacial\u201d and in some areas the UK has gone backwards.\n\nPolitical developments on the other side of the Channel are helpful to Starmer, because he can point out to his critics that the EU is not exactly a haven of contentment and prosperity, and hasn\u2019t been for some time.\n\nThere is some irony in the fact that the left\u2019s love affair with Europe began in the 1980s at a time when the EU\u2019s economic performance took a marked turn for the worse. Then in the 90s, the single currency was supposed to deliver faster growth and greater shared prosperity. Instead, as the growing support for populist parties shows all too clearly, monetary union has been accompanied by economic stagnation and rising inequality.\n\nVoters in the UK\u2019s industrial heartlands are not the only ones who feel marginalised and ignored: the same sentiments are widespread in struggling parts of Germany and France, particularly among young voters. Starmer may find that improving trade links with the UK is not top of the EU\u2019s list of priorities.\n\nInstead, the pressure is on him to use all the tools at his disposal \u2013 tax, procurement, state aid, nationalisation, subsidies, skills, control of migration \u2013 as part of an activist industrial strategy designed to boost growth and narrow regional divides. This was what those on the left who supported Brexit called for in 2016 and there is now even more of a need for such a strategy.\n\nDoubtless, some will say a Brexit growth strategy is an oxymoron. Others will say \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that Labour\u2019s growth strategy is too small to make a difference. Some may even be quietly hoping for Labour to come a cropper because it will ease the way to rejoining the EU. But there is no real difference between Labour\u2019s growth strategy and its Brexit strategy. If one fails then so does the other.",

        "title": "Things are not going to get better as long as oligarchs rule the roost in our democracies | George Monbiot",
        "body": "We are about to return to normal politics. After 14 years of Tory corruption and misrule, a Labour government will put this country back on track. Justice and decency will resume, public services will be rebuilt, our global standing will be restored, we will revert to a familiar state. Or so the story goes.\n\nWhat is the \u201cnormal\u201d envisaged by pundits and politicians of the left and centre? It is the most anomalous politics in the history of the world. Consciously or otherwise, they hark back to a remarkable period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich nations, wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to decent housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious and well-funded and a robust economic safety net prevented destitution. There had never been a period like it in the prior history of the world, and there has not been one since. Even during that period, general prosperity in the rich nations was supported by extreme exploitation, coups and violence imposed on the poor nations. We lived in a bubble, limited in time and space, in which extraordinary things happened. Yet somehow we think of it as normal.\n\nThose \u201cnormal\u201d politics were the result of something known to economic historians as the \u201cgreat compression\u201d: a drastic reduction in inequality caused by two world wars. In many powerful countries, a combination of the physical destruction of assets, the loss of colonial and overseas possessions, inflation, very high taxes, wage and price controls, requisitioning and nationalisation required by the wartime economy, as well as the effects of rising democracy and labour organisation, greatly reduced the income and assets of the rich. It also greatly improved, once the wars had ended, the position of the poor. For several decades, we benefited from the aftermath of these great shocks. Now the effect has faded. We are returning to true \u201cnormality\u201d.\n\nThe history of many centuries, including our own, shows that the default state of politics is not redistribution and general welfare, but a spiral of accumulation by the very rich, the extreme exploitation of labour, the seizure of common resources and exaction of rent for their use, extortion, coercion and violence. Normal is a society in which might is right. Normal is oligarchy.\n\nIn his magisterial book The Great Leveler, published in 2017, the historian Walter Scheidel explains that only four forces have ever significantly reversed inequality: mass-mobilisation warfare (such as the two world wars), total and violent revolution, state collapse and devastating plagues. Decisions, decisions.\n\nHe shows how warfare economies have been turned into welfare economies, sometimes by force. For example, following the defeat of Japan, the US occupation government, led by General Douglas MacArthur, sought what it called \u201cthe democratization of Japanese economic institutions\u201d to ensure \u201ca wide distribution of income and ownership of the means of production and trade\u201d. To this end, it imposed high property taxes, with a top marginal rate of 90%; broke up business conglomerates; demanded a labour union law enabling the right to organise and strike, and higher wages for workers; organised comprehensive land reform, which dissolved large holdings and distributed them to peasants; and introduced fiscal reform that led eventually to taxes on the highest incomes of 75% and an inheritance tax on the largest estates of 70%. These programmes resulted in the near-total destruction of income from capital and the creation in Japan of a political and economic democracy, almost from scratch.\n\nAll the major combatants were similarly transformed. In the US, the top rate of estate (inheritance) tax rose to 71% in 1941, and income tax to 94% in 1944. The National War Labor Board raised workers\u2019 pay while holding down executive pay. Union membership soared. In the UK, the top rate of income tax was held at 98% from 1941 to 1952. It took decades to decline to current levels. A purchase tax on luxury goods was introduced in 1940, with rates that later rose to 100%. The share of incomes captured by the richest 0.1% fell from 7% in 1937 to just over 1% in 1975.\n\nIn the absence of one of the four great catastrophes, income and capital inexorably accumulate in the hands of the few, and oligarchy returns. Oligarchs are people who translate their inordinate economic power into inordinate political power. They build a politics that suits them. Scheidel shows that as inequality rises, so does polarisation and political dysfunction, both of which favour the very rich, as a competent, proactive state is a threat to their interests. Dysfunction is what the Tories delivered and Donald Trump promises.\n\nOligarchs seek the destruction of oversight, which is why UK bodies such as the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive have been comprehensively gutted. The same desire was the driving force behind Brexit. They want the cessation of protest. They want a failing NHS, to justify privatisation. They want malleable politicians and a tame BBC. They get what they want, distorting every aspect of national life. They pour money into neoliberal and far-right political movements, which help capital to solve its perennial problem: democracy. The arc of history bends towards injustice. But every so often it is broken over the knee of catastrophe.\n\nIf you want a return to the rich nations\u2019 \u201cnormality\u201d of 1945 to 1975 \u2013 in other words, to redistribution, a shared sense of national purpose, robust public services and a strong economic safety net, high employment and good wages \u2013 and I think most people would, you need a politics that is not just abnormal, but unprecedented. Snapping the arc of injustice would mean going way beyond Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 2019 manifesto, let alone Keir Starmer\u2019s limp offering, which treads so carefully around the interests of the rich. We would need to do what the world wars did, without the violence and physical destruction: a peacetime MacArthur programme for overthrowing the oligarchs.\n\nPolitical parties would need to overcome their fear of economic power: of the newspaper barons, the property developers, the fossil fuel companies, hedge funds, private equity bosses and assorted oligarchs who now fund and influence our politics. The longer we leave this confrontation, the more extreme and entrenched oligarchic power becomes. If we want even a modicum of democracy, equality, fairness and a functioning state, we need not the accommodation with economic power that Starmer seeks, but the mother of all battles with it.",

        "body": "Prom Week has arrived in Tennessee, and the class of 2024 is lined up in suits and crowns, posing for pictures by the red carpet. Who says four legs and a tail should stop you from going to the ball?\n\nIt\u2019s just another day in doggy daycare. As well as a graduation ceremony, canines at this facility in Franklin, Tennessee, on the outskirts of Nashville, were recently treated to bark-uterie \u2013 customized charcuterie boards \u2013 and challenged by Sports Week, for which they were dressed up with sweatbands.\n\n\u201cI did have someone tell me that our daycare calendar has more activities than their child\u2019s school,\u201d reflects Samantha Talbot, who manages the site, inside the North American headquarters of Mars Petcare.\n\nThere is method \u2013 and money \u2013 in all this madness. The pet industry is booming. Across the world, the market is projected to swell to almost $500bn by the end of the decade. In the US alone, it is expected to attract more than $150bn in spending this year, up from $97.1bn just five years ago.\n\nMars is at the center of this surge. While perhaps most associated with its myriad brands aimed at humans, from M&Ms and Wrigley\u2019s gum to Dolmio cooking sauce, the sprawling conglomerate \u2013 one of the largest private companies in the world \u2013 now generates more money from its animal-focused businesses than those aimed at people.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dogs at the Mars Petcare headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nIt is behind dozens of pet food brands, including Royal Canin, Pedigree, Sheba and Whiskas, as well as nearly 3,000 veterinary clinics, hospitals and diagnostic labs. Of the $50bn in sales Mars generated in 2023, the company says about 60% came from its pet-care arm.\n\nBut demand is shifting as rapidly as it is growing. A new generation of owners has brought new priorities, concerns and approaches \u2013 as demonstrated by the parades at Mars\u2019s US pet HQ.\n\n\u201cThirty years ago dogs slept in the garden,\u201d Lo\u00efc Moutault, global president of Mars Petcare, noted as he toured some of its Tennessee sites with the Guardian. \u201cNow they sleep in our beds!\u201d\n\nMore people are getting pets earlier in their lives, he said. An estimated 16% of American pet owners are now gen Z.\n\nNot that Mars calls them owners. \u201cPet parents\u201d are less likely to ban their animals from certain rooms, as was once the norm, and more likely to take them away on holiday. \u201cThe depth of the relationship is completely different,\u201d according to Moutault.\n\nThis generation is also far less prepared to trust pet food companies or even vets. Younger owners do their homework \u2013 and readily challenge the vets treating their pets, and the companies making their food. \u201cThis generation is way more cynical, and therefore demanding,\u201d Moutault said, \u201cin terms of how genuine we are about what we are proposing and offering.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Lo\u00efc Moutault.\n\nMars first branched out into the pet industry when it bought the British maker of Chappie canned dog food in 1935. More recently, the company built up a vast chain of veterinary clinics and hospitals through a multibillion-dollar string of takeovers.\n\nThe accelerated growth of its pet-care division has helped Mars double sales across its wider business over the past decade. The man behind its recent expansion in this market, Poul Weihrauch, was promoted to run the whole company in 2022.\n\nTop executives at Mars believe sales in this market will \u2013 and should \u2013 surge for years to come. \u201cPets make a better world for us,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cWe want to make a better world for pets.\u201d\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s Franklin site is complete with a dog park with wifi, how company brass say every office should look. Mars has so far certified nearly 150 US cities as pet-friendly, with homes, businesses and parks that are deemed welcoming. It hopes many more will follow the example of Nashville, which has a pet \u201crelief area\u201d at its airport and a dog park at its hockey arena.\n\nThere is, of course, a vested interest here: a better world for pets also means a better world for Mars. Should the international pet population continue to swell, it\u2019s a reasonable bet that its sales will, too.\n\n\u201cWe are a business, and we are absolutely unapologetic about that,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re not; we are. We are a business, and we are, thankfully, successful, growing, developing.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Employees with their pets at the Mars Petcare headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nThe firm has its fair share of critics. Mars \u201cprofits at the expense of animals and the people who care about them\u201d, said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice-president at the animal rights group Peta, who accused it of \u201cmaking vet care more expensive and less accessible\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, where Mars is one of the biggest owners of veterinary practices, rising pet-care prices have put the industry on a collision course with the country\u2019s anti-trust watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether pet owners are overpaying for medicines and asking if large, integrated vet groups \u201cact in ways which reduce consumer choice\u201d.\n\nAcademics have raised questions, too, about the environmental impact of mass pet food production. And Mars has faced a backlash over its decision to continue operating in Russia after that country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMars pointed to its creation of a climate reformulation team, focused on increasing the use of less carbon-intense ingredients, which it says has already carried out \u201cnumerous reformulations\u201d of recipes.\n\nMore broadly, Moutault insists that the company has a purpose beyond profits. The group is \u201cadvocating for the role of pets in society\u201d, he said. You can actually be cynic[al] about that and say, \u2018Well, do we really need that?\u2019, [but] I actually think human beings are wired to care. There is an inherent satisfaction of caring for a pet. It\u2019s an emotional reward that makes people feel good about themselves.\u201d\n\nPushing back against those who believe his company is purely encouraging the pet boom for its own gain, Moutault argues there are \u201ccountless\u201d benefits of having an animal \u2013 and that many sit hand-in-paw with Mars making money.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While oral hygiene has \u201cmassively evolved\u201d for humans, the development has been less advanced for pets. Mars vet hospitals are offering plans with yearly dental check-ups, in a bid to reduce the chance of tooth removals. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call holistic value creation,\u201d he says: animals in less pain, pets that live longer and Mars, rather than charging for one tooth-extraction appointment, capitalizing on multiple check-ups.\n\nFor similar reasons, Moutault, claims the company is also trying to help overweight pets. \u201cThe owners struggle to see that because they themselves, sometimes, are a little bit overweight, if I may say,\u201d he says. Mars \u201cshould have no interest\u201d in tackling this \u2013 after all, it might sell less food \u2013 but it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lo\u00efc Moutault (right) tours a Mars kibble-production plant.\n\nStaff at its vet clinics are encouraged to have \u201cvery difficult\u201d conversations with pet owners about exercise and portion sizes. Mars is also developing kibble which is lower in calories.\n\nHe also points to the human benefits \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 of owning an animal. \u201cIf I was very cynical,\u201d Moutault suggests, \u201cI would say, \u2018Well, I should ask the government to recognize the fact that we are reducing, actually, healthcare costs for a big part of the human beings who have pets.\u2019\u201d\n\nFew owners of cats and dogs have thought costs were falling in recent years when stocking up on supplies, or counting the zeros on the latest vet bill, however. Are they really getting a fair deal?\n\nMoutault, acknowledges that Mars, a giant in both the pet food and vet care markets, was \u201cvery impacted\u201d by inflation, before pushing back. Pet owners have \u201cway more options than they\u2019ve ever had\u201d, he says, claiming there is a \u201cvery, very large and wide\u201d range of prices around.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vet clinic workers and a patient at the Mars-owned BluePearl emergency hospital in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nToday people are \u201cmore and more willing to actually do more for their pets\u201d, according to Moutault, and there are more and more options available. We are sitting inside a 24-hour pet hospital, with MRI and CT scanners, an intensive care unit, recovery and oxygenated cages, and surgery suites.\n\nDoing more often requires spending more. \u201cObviously some people feel compelled to do whatever it takes. Others are saying, \u2018Well, no, there is a limit to what I can do,\u2019\u201d Moutault says, allowing that this \u201ccreates, potentially, a perception\u201d of rising vet prices.\n\n\u201cSo do they have a fair deal? I think it\u2019s very clear, and we are very clear, that taking a pet is a commitment,\u201d says Moutault. \u201cYou can\u2019t always assume that your pet is going to be healthy.\n\n\u201cAnd trying to develop this consciousness, that you have to kind of anticipate and prepare for that, I think, is an evolution that we want to bring to the pet ownership culture in a way: that you have to anticipate for some of these things happening.\u201d\n\nBig pet goes to great lengths to win over owners, and turn them into reliable customers. A few miles up the road from the hospital, inside a sensory laboratory, a panel of 10 people is tasked with breaking down the smell of certain food samples by considering about 130 different aromatic notes. Is there a whiff of a certain meat, perhaps? Or a specific fruit?\n\nView image in fullscreen Technicians examine kibble under a microscope at the Mars Petcare global innovation center in Thompson\u2019s Station, Tennessee.\n\nSuch samples are examined in forensic detail under microscopes.

Currently, one in 10 children are affected by it and it is considered a key driver of poverty in the UK. We spent six months with families across the country to build a picture of the impact of this rule on day-to-day family life. Parents talked frequently of fairness and were at pains to explain how they must treat all children the same, even if the government doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give money to one and not the other and it\u2019s not their fault they were born after the government brought a rule in.\u201d Carol\u2019s children are 16, 11, eight and four and has supported her family on her own on the wage she brings in, and on universal credit.\n\nView image in fullscreen Matthew and Lucy stop for drinks and snacks at the park.\n\nShe works three days a week, and gets \u00a3909 a month in the child element of universal credit for three children - her eldest was born pre-2016 so has always been eligible for payments. In May, her income was \u00a32,753 in total for her and the four children, and her rent is \u00a31,140. Earlier this month, she got married, which means universal credit payments will reduce when she starts living with her new partner.\n\n\u201cI could work more hours, but when would I see them and I need to make sure there\u2019s a decent meal on the table,\u201d she says.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nathan, Faith and Logan at the sports pitch.

Altogether, she is living on \u00a31,200 a month with shopping, gas and electric bills, council tax, water, TV licence coming out of that and travel costs to the local hospital to take one of her sons to various appointments.\n\n\u201cThe rule came into force in the April of 2017 and I had my daughter in the October.

        "body": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.\n\nRecent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.\n\nAndresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.\n\n\u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An earnings limit means you do not qualify for carer\u2019s allowance if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week. Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy\n\nWith just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.\n\nCarer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.\n\nCarers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.\n\nThose who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nCarers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen A recent survey found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with the cost of living. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\n\u201cRemoving unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,\u201d Walker says.\n\nShe says the low level of the payments doesn\u2019t recognise what carers do, \u201cand there are clear problems in the way that it\u2019s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d\n\nStephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d\n\nAmong proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.\n\nWalker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d",

        "body": "Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.\n\nWhile students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.\n\nThe UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university\u2019s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.\n\nStudent accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.\n\nMegan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: \u201cStudents become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.\n\n\u201cFor example, if a student\u2019s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThis only applies to final-year students; students don\u2019t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.\u201d\n\nManchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.\n\nA spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: \u201cIt\u2019s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.\u201d\n\nCouncil tax bills are based on a property\u2019s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.\n\nAccording to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between \u00a368,001 and \u00a388,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be \u00a32,171 a year. This is about \u00a3181 a month \u2013 a lot when a third of students live off less than \u00a350.\n\nStudents who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.\n\nThere can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.\n\nStudents who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council\u2019s discretion.\n\nHowever, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.\n\nIt is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.",

It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs.\n\nMany of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.\n\nAt the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.\n\nThese require a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires \u00a310,000 to open an account.\n\nHowever, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d.\n\nThis is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively.\n\nOther providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d\n\nIt is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.\n\nLoyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.",

Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of \u00a3100 \u2013 reduced to \u00a360 if paid within 14 days.\n\nHowever, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.\n\nThe AA\u2019s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: \u201cThis self-authored code doesn\u2019t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees \u2026 These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.\u201d\n\nThe code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.\n\nIt also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an \u201cappeals charter\u201d for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.\n\nParking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.\n\nPoliticians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses \u2013 which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year \u2013 for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.\n\nA bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019.

I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.\n\nI see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging \u00a340 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.\n\nML, by email\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.\n\nIt is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge \u2013 one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.\n\nI asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.\n\n\u201cThe fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWith reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.\u201d\n\nIf everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this \u00a340 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.\n\nI hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",

        "body": "Labour would rather have stability in the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU\u2019s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.\n\nAddressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been \u201cvery difficult for businesses\u201d because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.\n\nWith less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.\n\nSome business leaders and economists have said Labour\u2019s hopes to grow the economy \u2013 and thereby pay for improved public services \u2013 could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.\n\n\u201cYou could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.\u201d\n\nKemi Badenoch, Reynolds\u2019s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the \u201cpower of business to do good\u201d.\n\nHowever, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on \u201cmy favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics\u201d.\n\nBadenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy \u2013 an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May \u2013 was \u201cmorally repellent\u201d and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to \u201censhrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people\u201d as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.\n\nShevaun Haviland, the BCC\u2019s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d and try to improve the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that \u201cbusinesses don\u2019t want a renegotiation\u201d.\n\nAmanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that \u201can air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy\u201d and that some of the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.\n\nLabour\u2019s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party\u2019s relationship with business was \u201cone of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019\u201d.\n\nHe was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour\u2019s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

        "body": "Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK\u2019s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nOfficials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said.\n\nBut it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population \u2013heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.\n\n\u201cPolicy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,\u201d the Bank\u2019s financial stability report said. Questions over a country\u2019s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was \u201crelevant to UK financial stability\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.\n\nThat includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.\n\nIn total, about 3 million \u2013 or 35% \u2013 of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders \u2013 including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level \u2013 could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.\n\nThere are also concerns about the financial system\u2019s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.\n\n\u201cAlthough the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,\u201d the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.\n\nPolicymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK\u2019s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and \u201csevere\u201d economic shocks.\n\nThe first \u2013 a \u201csupply-shock scenario\u201d echoing the ripple effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.\n\nThe second \u201cdemand-shock scenario\u201d \u2013 which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns \u2013 assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.\n\nThis year\u2019s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain.

So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached \u201cthe beginning of the end-game\u201d, as some \u2013 such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank \u2013 have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is \u201cjust the flipside\u201d of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want?

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).\n\nOrders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: \u201cLast month\u2019s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it\u2019s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it\u2019s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK\u2019s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.\u201d Share\n\n3d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx.

LGIM says it concerned over TJX\u2019s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of \u201cmaterial Scope 3 emissions\u201d that fail to account for its material value chains\u2019 emissions. Today\u2019s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM\u2019s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this \u201cstewardship\u201d of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.\u201d Share",

The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.\n\nDr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as \u201ca new climate and human health threat\u201d and urged air freight companies to \u201cend their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail\u201d.\n\nAir freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.\n\nThe researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon\u2019s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.\n\nThe researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.\n\nThe report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.\n\nBy 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.\n\nFedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry\u2019s carbon emissions in 2023.

        "body": "With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.\n\nOn one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.\n\nThis increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\n\nAlarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.\n\nAlthough the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThese measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration\u2019s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe new US tariffs could extend beyond China\u2019s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.\n\nTo be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies \u2013 often in the form of cheap credit \u2013 have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.\n\nAdmittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.\n\nWith US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition \u2013 if we were to embrace it.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University.

        "body": "Your editorial rightly points out that GDP is not a good measure of how people are faring (19 June). As an alternative, you offer the UN\u2019s human development index. But we already have a better British alternative \u2013 the measure of life satisfaction in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 annual population survey.\n\nThe question asked is: \u201cOverall, how satisfied are you with your life these days (0: not at all satisfied, 10: completely)?\u201d The results are published every quarter. That is an excellent measure of the nation\u2019s success. It provides a good account of how we are doing on average and of the degree of fundamental inequality in our society.\n\nIt should become the objective of government policy to maximise wellbeing, measured in this way. As Thomas Jefferson said: \u201cThe life and happiness of the people ... is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\u201d And Keir Starmer has said that \u201cwith every pound spent on your behalf, we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on actual income but also its effect on wellbeing\u201d. So let us hope that the new government will judge all its policy options by their effects (per pound spent) on the life satisfaction of the population.\n\nProf Richard Layard\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nThe Guardian is correct to agree with the late Robert Kennedy, who said in 1968 that growth figures measured everything \u201cexcept that which makes life worthwhile\u201d. More than 50 years later, it is important to recognise that a thriving economy makes an important contribution to the UK\u2019s collective wellbeing. But GDP remains a poor measure of social progress. It measures criminal activity, but not caring responsibilities, and takes no account of the impact on public health or the planet.\n\nThat is why the next government should ground its decision-making in a wide range of statistics that measure our collective wellbeing. Ministers need to complement GDP data with a broad basket of figures about the reality of our lives and our impact on the environment.\n\nIn 2023, Carnegie\u2019s Life in the UK Index revealed yawning gaps in wellbeing between different groups in society. Only when similar datasets are used to underpin policymaking will governments have any hope of properly tackling the biggest problems of our time.\n\nSarah Davidson\n\nChief executive, Carnegie UK\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the public don\u2019t necessarily understand what GDP means, many politicians and journalists don\u2019t seem to know how GDP is calculated. As the economist Richard J Murphy has pointed out, \u201c10% of GDP is made up\u201d. When calculating GDP, the average cost of renting is used to figure out how much money owner-occupiers would be spending if they rented rather than owned their homes. This is called \u201cimputed rents\u201d and it accounts for around 10% of GDP.\n\nBut does it make sense to call rent a productive part of the economy? If all landlords raised their rents massively, this would appear on GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d, when in reality, no new goods or services would have been produced. It\u2019s the same with private equity \u2013 if a financial investor buys and then asset-strips a company, this will appear in GDP as \u201cgrowth\u201d. But again, nothing has been produced, and therefore highly unproductive economic exchanges can appear in the GDP statistics as \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\nLooking at GDP in isolation is in practice about as useful as relying on the position of celestial bodies to tell you about your love life.\n\nEthan Oshoko\n\nSt Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex",

Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: \u201cConfidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that\u2019s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future.

Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday.

In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.

But the public is being kept in the dark about what might happen.\n\nThat, put briefly, was the gist of what the Institute for Fiscal Studies had to say about the Conservative and Labour party manifestos. The thinktank was also pretty dismissive about the plans of the smaller parties: the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Reform UK.\n\nThe IFS analysis is relatively simple. Debt as a share of national income is at its highest since the early 1960s. Taxes are close to the record level reached in the aftermath of the second world war. Spending has increased by more in the past five years than ever before under a Conservative government.\n\nYet, the thinktank says, public services \u2013 everything from the NHS to prisons \u2013 are visibly struggling. And fresh cuts of between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn will be on the way for unprotected Whitehall departments if the party elected on July 4 wants to reduce debt and avoid raising taxes.\n\nThe Conservative plan involves tax cuts of \u00a317bn, paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by cutting \u00a312bn from the welfare bill, mainly by slowing the increase in claims for disability benefit. The IFS says this equates to 1.6 million people losing an average of \u00a37,500 a year each, and would be politically hard to achieve.\n\nJudging by the opinion polls, there is no prospect of the Conservatives forming the next government and the only question is the scale of the party\u2019s defeat. Inevitably, the focus in the last week or so of the campaign will be on what Labour will do. The IFS is sceptical that faster than expected growth will lead to higher tax revenues and so spare Rachel Reeves from making tough choices.\n\nStronger growth would certainly help. The IFS says that if growth exceeds the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts by 0.5 percentage points a year \u2013 which it says is unlikely but not inconceivable \u2013 that would strengthen the public finances by \u00a330bn annually. But it says Reeves also needs to plan for what she might do if growth turns out to be 0.5 points weaker.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last chancellor to run a primary surplus was Gordon Brown a quarter of a century ago.\n\nJohnson thinks it unlikely that Reeves will cut spending, which leaves the choice between tweaking the fiscal rules, raising taxes by more than already laid out in the manifesto, or both. As the IFS notes, opposition parties that win elections tend to raise taxes in their first budget.",

Share\n\n5d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. \u201cIt\u2019s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then\u201d, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. \u201cWe don\u2019t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,\u201d Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally\u2026 Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests\u2019 leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is \u201cvery much focused\u201d on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a \u201cquite exceptional\u201d job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month\u2019s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now \u201cterrified\u201d at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was \u201cno better job\u201d than Business and Trade Secretary, which \u201cis a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister\u201d. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats\u2026 would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before\u2026. That doesn\u2019t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid\u2026 and appears to leave the door open for one\u2026. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d situation; she doesn\u2019t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its \u00a315.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK\u2019s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share\n\n5d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer\u2026]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the \u201chighest standards\u201d on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers\u2019 homes, meaning they fall below the \u00a3135 threshold for import duty \u201cThat could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,\u201d Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share\n\n5d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What\u2019s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an \u201cobvious place to look for that\u201d money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and \u2018make the case\u2019 for investing in Britain. \u2018It won\u2019t take as long as people think\u2019: Rachel Reeves on being \u2018scrappy\u2019 \u2013 and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour\u2019s plans come from the \u201creasonable complaints\u201d of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn\u2019t know the country\u2019s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST\n\n5d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. \u201cWe will look again\u201d at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers \u2013 that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money\u2026. Share\n\n5d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven\u2019t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share\n\n5d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union \u2013 starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that \u2018relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they\u2019re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won\u2019t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don\u2019t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn\u2019t accept it. She insists the UK can\u2019t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share\n\n5d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it\u2019s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. \u201cThose are facts\u201d. Well\u2026.. this thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.\n\nWe'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.\n\nIt's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\nActually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that \"leapfrogging\" notion is wrong.\n\nIf anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.\n\nRaising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?\n\nBrexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.\n\nIf u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.\n\nFilm I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.\n\nEven tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest \"exports\" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.\n\nThe @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.\n\nAnd this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ \u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.\n\nAre we still in fourth place?\n\nIn short: no.\n\nLook, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.\n\nIn fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015.

Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum\u2026. Kemi Badenoch says she \u201ccompletely disagrees\u201d with IFS\u2019s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS\u2019s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS\u2026. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don\u2019t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says \u2013 and that\u2019s Labour\u2019s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won\u2019t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that\u2019s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government\u2019s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share\n\n5d ago 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour\u2019s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour\u2019s manifesto is \u201ca pro-worker, pro-business\u201d agenda, that \u2013 he says \u2013 has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that \u201cThe floor will rise\u201d, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it\u2019s businesses don\u2019t want these measures. She claims it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour\u2019s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are \u201cterrible regulations\u201d. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn\u2019t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won\u2019t accept this, telling business leaders they should be \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of \u201csurrendering\u201d your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are \u201cfishing in an empty barrel\u201d, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy.

        "body": "A Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules rather than cut spending in the event that stronger growth fails to rescue it from tough post-election choices, the head of a leading thinktank has said.\n\nPaul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the pressures on spending \u2013 including from public sector pay \u2013 were so powerful that he couldn\u2019t envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books.\n\nAsked at a press conference on the party manifestos what Labour would do in the event that growth is weaker than expected, Johnson said: \u201cThe pressure to change the fiscal rules or find more money from tax will be quite significant.\u201d\n\nThe IFS director said doctors were pushing for higher pay, teachers had faced a 25-year pay squeeze and civil servants\u2019 pay had been held down. \u201cThere are so many pressures on spending it is very hard for that to be the thing that gives.\u201d\n\nLabour has said it would stick to the current government\u2019s spending plans and meet the rule that debt should be declining as a share of national income after five years. It has announced modest tax rises to fund for additional spending on items such as hiring new teachers and increasing the number of dental appointments.\n\nThe IFS said both the main parties were ducking the hard choices that they would face after the election, leaving voters operating in a knowledge vacuum.\n\nAlthough he doubted whether Labour would cut spending, Johnson said that on the basis of the manifestos it was not known how the next government would respond to weaker than expected growth. \u201cIf taxes are to go up, we do not know which ones. We certainly don\u2019t know how they would respond if things were to get worse.\u201d\n\nIn a withering assessment, the IFS said neither manifesto recognised the pressure on the public finances caused by a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of low growth and the after-effects of the pandemic and the energy crisis.\n\nJohnson said: \u201cThe choices in front of us are hard. High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier. That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them.

As the population ages, these choices will become harder, not easier. We cannot wish them away,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson said commitments to improve the NHS were essentially unfunded promises and that a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d meant neither main party had made any serious proposals to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cDespite a (damaging) rush to rule out increases in all sorts of tax rates, it will be a considerable surprise if no other taxes are increased over the next five years. After all, they are currently much higher than was implied by the 2019 Conservative party manifesto.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the manifestos told voters more about what they wouldn\u2019t do than what they would. \u201cTax locks \u2013 pledges not to increase specific taxes or tax rates \u2013 aren\u2019t new. But this time, the parties have really gone to town. We\u2019ve seen something of a tax lock arms race,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThese tax locks are a mistake. They will constrain policy if a future government decides that it does in fact want to raise more money to fund public services.

        "body": "In 1944, the groundbreaking political economist Karl Polanyi published his radical magnum opus, The Great Transformation. In it, he accused influential liberal economists, including David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus, of commodifying human beings and the environment in the name of the free market.\n\nTheir Industrial Age ideas, he argued, ushered in the barbarism and poverty that came with 19th-century globalisation and unfettered capitalism, and this led, in the 20th century, to far-right and far-left backlashes against the movements of socialism, individualism and liberalism that followed.\n\nToday, The Great Transformation is lauded as a masterpiece and praised for its prescience by everyone from the former chief economist of the World Bank \u2013 the Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz \u2013 to shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and the French \u201crock star\u201d economist Thomas Piketty. Yet Polanyi\u2019s status as a Hungarian-Austrian foreigner of Jewish descent and the postwar popularity of Keynesian economics meant his book\u2019s prophetic insights were, for decades, rejected and neglected by mainstream academics and economists in Britain. Now, for the first time since the second world war, The Great Transformation has finally been published by a British publisher, with a new edition by Penguin Classics that came out last week.\n\n\u201cPolanyi is the most important thinker you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d said Penguin editor Hana Teraie-Wood. \u201cHe was one of the first heterodox economists and one of the first \u2013 perhaps even one of the founding \u2013 environmental economists. He\u2019s always been there, but he\u2019s just never had his time in the sun.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Album/Alamy\n\nBorn into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1886 and educated in Budapest, he was forced to flee Hungary by a proto-fascist regime in 1919, later becoming a prominent Christian socialist and journalist in Vienna. When Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 and fascism took off in Austria, he fled again, this time with his daughter to London, where he became a British citizen and eked out a living teaching part-time for the Workers\u2019 Educational Association. His lecture notes would prove the basis for The Great Transformation.\n\n\u201cHe conceived most of the ideas for the book when he was living in the UK, and it was predominantly about the history of capitalism in England \u2013 and yet no British publisher has really taken him on before,\u201d said Teraie-Wood. For years, he tried to get a job at a university in Britain, applying every\u00adwhere from Oxford to Hull. \u201cHe had fantastic references from luminaries of the intellectual left but he wasn\u2019t able to get the jobs that really, with his genius, he should have been a shoo-in for,\u201d said Dr Gareth Dale, an expert on Polanyi who wrote the introduction to the Penguin edition.\n\nHe added: \u201cI think there was some xenophobia and suspicion about him as an outsider, a foreigner with a funny-sounding name. There was probably prejudice, there was probably some antisemitism. And there was certainly some snobbery towards him. He should have walked into those jobs.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi. Photograph: Penguin Classics\n\nIn 1940, he was offered a fellowship at Bennington College in Vermont in the US and so emigrated there, where he wrote The Great Transformation and then took up a post at Columbia. \u201cLike other brilliant Jews who fled their homelands under the pogroms and pressures of antisemitism and fascism, Polanyi fetched up on British shores \u2013 only to then transplant to America,\u201d said Dale.\n\nPolanyi had observed that, in the 1930s, wealthy Germans who saw the Nazi party as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d against trade unions and socialists were persuaded to overlook Hitler\u2019s antisemitism because it allowed the market system to flourish, Dale said. \u201cIn the same way that a lot of Americans who find Trump distasteful today will still vote for him, a lot of German elites said to themselves: we\u2019re quite happy funding Hitler because his street fighters will help crush the trade unions, so that we can make more profits.\u201d\n\nPolanyi lost friends and relatives in the war, including his younger sister in the Holocaust. \u201cThe whole book is, in a sense, about fascism, something that Polanyi himself suffered from enormously,\u201d said Dale. \u201cThis is why it has renewed, real relevance today.\u201d\n\nThe Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi (Penguin Books Ltd, \u00a310.99).

        "body": "Labour will win by a mile but is coming to power at the worst possible moment. The economy has been laid waste by the Conservatives, who have deployed a scorched earth policy that will ensure the incoming government has the inheritance from hell.\n\nThat, at least, is the conventional wisdom, a view that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have done nothing to counter. There is a reason for that. It suits Labour\u2019s campaign message to paint the blackest possible picture so that it can blame the Tories for any tough decisions they have to make.\n\nEven so, the conventional wisdom is wrong. Without in any way minimising the challenges Starmer and Reeves face, this is actually not a bad time to be arriving in office.\n\nSure, excessively high interest rates threaten to derail the UK\u2019s fledgling recovery. No question, years of weak productivity growth, coupled with the cost of a pandemic, and a cost of living crisis have left the public finances in a mess. Nobody would dispute that the economy is in a worse state than it was the last time Labour emerged from opposition in 1997. Covid has left deep and permanent scars.\n\nThat said, the new government will have a number of things going for it. For a start, expectations are at such a rock-bottom level that it won\u2019t take much to exceed them. The desire of voters to get rid of the Tories does not appear to be matched by a similar enthusiasm for what Labour is offering. Faith in politicians of all stripes is at a low ebb, so nobody is anticipating much.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the Tories have been forced to clear up their own mess rather than \u2013 as was the case in 1964 and 1974 \u2013 leaving Labour to do the dirty work. And, to be fair, Sunak has made a reasonably good fist of it.\n\nIt is not really true that the Tories have been laying waste the economy. On the contrary, Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have taken some extremely unpopular decisions \u2013 the six-year freeze on tax allowances, for example \u2013 to reduce public borrowing.\n\nGiven the chaos they inherited from Liz Truss, they perhaps had little option but to play things straight, but Hunt\u2019s decision to provide firms with permanent 100% tax relief on investment spending was a smart move. It addresses one of the economy\u2019s enduring weaknesses and should bear fruit over time, helping Labour more than it has the Conservatives.\n\nAt the end of 2022, shortly after Truss left office, the Bank of England was expecting the longest recession in 100 years, one lasting from the summer of 2022 to the middle of this year.\n\nThe economy did end up in recession, but it was a short-lived and shallow affair lasting just two quarters and nothing like as severe as slumps of the past. All things considered, the economy held up a lot better to higher interest rates and rising taxes than the Bank feared.\n\nThe current state of the economy also suggests there is going to be a post-election bounce. Household budgets are much less stretched than they were a year ago because pay is rising faster than prices. That\u2019s insufficient to make good the losses suffered earlier in this parliament, but it does mean consumer confidence is on the up. There is evidence from the latest S&P snapshot of the economy that households have been putting off spending decisions until after the election.\n\nSooner or later, the Bank of England will decide the time is right to reduce interest rates. Theadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold at 5.25% this week but signalled that cheaper borrowing costs may not be that long in coming: either in August or September. The fact that some of the seven members who voted for no change said the decision was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d could mean the former.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the fact that the Bank is likely to move shortly after Labour arrives in power will reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This should cement the idea that a change of government has had a positive effect. Interest rates could be as low as 3% by the end of 2025.\n\nNor is Reeves as boxed in by fiscal policy as is assumed. She is committed to the same debt rule as Hunt \u2013 namely that debt as a share of national income should be falling at the end of a rolling five-year period. But as Andrew Goodwin, of the Oxford Economics consultancy, points out, the measure of debt used includes the impact of the cost of the Treasury indemnifying the Bank of England for losses when it sells UK bonds gilts bought under the money creation scheme known as quantitative easing.\n\nTweaking the debt rule to exclude these payments would give Reeves an extra \u00a320bn to play with, and it would be a major surprise \u2013 and a missed opportunity \u2013 were she not to announce the change in an autumn budget.\n\nThe way things are shaping up, that budget will take place with the Conservative party in turmoil following a defeat of historic proportions. Unless there is another Covid-like shock to the economy, Labour will be able to plan for two full terms in office. If tough decisions are needed \u2013 as they probably will be \u2013 Starmer and Reeves can say that is a price that sadly has to be paid after 14 years of Tory incompetence.",

        "body": "A human rights group has urged Britain\u2019s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein\u2019s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein\u2019s cotton suppliers in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.\n\nRepresented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that \u201cany attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused\u201d.\n\nThe China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (\u00a352bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein\u2019s potential London listing would be a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: \u201cShein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company\u2019s supply chains.\n\nThe group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK\u2019s convention obligations, it said.\n\n\u201cThe FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: \u201cStop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn\u2019t the place to come for a \u2018no questions asked\u2019 approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange\u2019s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein\u2019s supply chains.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign group\u2019s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the \u201caccuracy of its published modern slavery statement\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnder the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.\n\nBefore a company\u2019s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company\u2019s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA\u2019s role to independently verify the accurate of information.\n\nMichael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: \u201cA firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.\n\nThe company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.\n\nThe group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise \u00a330m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.\n\nThe decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.\n\nAt the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: \u201cThis unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London\u2019s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.\u201d\n\nThe change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.\n\nIn May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.\n\nHowever, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.\n\nThe Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.\n\nInstead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond novels.\n\nThe tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.\n\nSky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.\n\nCity sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.\n\nMoney blog: How to split housework fairly\n\nThese are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.\n\nAn outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.\n\nOVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.\n\nUnder Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.\n\nOVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.\n\nImage: Stephen Fitzpatrick launched OVO in 2009. Pic: OVO\n\nIn recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.\n\nIn May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.\n\nMr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.\n\nHe is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nFour major banks hit by glitches\n\nExit from recession stronger than first thought\n\nEx-Fujitsu engineer denies 'protecting the monster'\n\nKey to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.\n\nOVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (\u00a3395m) valuation.\n\nKaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.\n\nOVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.\n\nIn 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of \u00a31.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.\n\nIt said this had \"no cash impact\" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nLast summer, the company announced a \u00a3200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.\n\nOther investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.\n\nMayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.\n\nThis weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.\n\nLike its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.\n\nLast month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of \u00a3122, to \u00a31568.\n\nOther big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over \u00a37bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.\n\nCentrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of \u00a37.3bn.\n\nOVO, whose valuation in any major transaction was unclear this weekend, declined to comment.",

        "title": "Evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Position In The AI Market (NYSE:HPE)",
        "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) split from HP Inc. (HPQ) in 2015, with HP focusing on personal computers and printers and Hewlett Packard Enterprise focusing on business-focused servers, storage, networking, the cloud, software, and various services. HPE benefits from many of the same trends in enterprise computing that had pushed Dell Technologies' (DELL) stock up over 100% earlier this year. In my Dell article, I discussed how investors saw clearer evidence in its last earnings report released on May 30, 2024, that demand for artificial intelligence (\"AI\") enterprise servers could be a huge growth driver for the company moving forward.\n\nThe market recently became more excited by HPE's prospects after it released its second quarter fiscal year (\"FY\") 2024 earnings report on June 4, showing AI systems revenue more than doubled from the first quarter's results. Investors in HPE hope that now that the company's AI initiatives are picking up, its stock performance can achieve a similar performance as Dell's. The stock rose around 11% the day after the company released the report.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe problem is that although the market may give HPE credit for potentially benefiting from AI adoption, its strategy has several risks, including AI servers being less profitable than the traditional server business. Investors should proceed cautiously and not buy this stock purely based on its AI opportunity. Additionally, although several analysts raised its price target post-earnings, the stock price has already exceeded the consensus price target of $20.12.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThis article will discuss HPE's latest AI initiatives and review its latest earnings report. I will also examine the company's valuation and some risks. Last, I will discuss why I believe HPE is a hold.\n\nThe company may be an AI beneficiary\n\nAlthough some people focus on HPE's opportunity to provide AI servers to its customers, it's important to remember that the company is a complete AI solutions provider, meaning it offers services beyond its hardware components. HPE has several other services, including software tools, security solutions, Machine Learning as a Service, consulting, and a hybrid cloud tool builder named GreenLake. Hybrid computing is critical for companies using AI. Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Antonio Neri commented on the hybrid cloud's importance at the Discover 2024:\n\nAI will require hybrid cloud. But AI is not one single thing or a monolithic workload. To deploy AI, you must orchestrate hundreds of microservices, multiple AI models, specific accelerators, and connect many different data sources, all of which are highly distributed across your hybrid IT state. That is why you need a hybrid strategy. At the same time, you must maintain data governance, regulatory compliance, and security end-to-end, making on-premise private clouds essential to your hybrid mix.\n\nAs generative AI proliferates, HPE's hybrid computing solutions, software, and other peripheral services should become more valuable over the long term. Collaborations with partners like Microsoft are also meaningful. When analysts asked Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Marie Myers at the BofA Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference about the partnership with Microsoft, she said, \"HP is helping Microsoft extend the Azure AI platform to customers like OpenAI.\"\n\nManagement also announced at its recent Investor Relations Summit @ HPE Discover 2024 that it was collaborating with NVIDIA (NVDA) on a new venture named Nvidia AI Computing by HPE. This venture addresses three critical components needed for successfully utilizing Generative AI and large language models. NVIDEO CEO said at the conference that the three necessary components are a \"model stack, a data stack, and a computing stack.\"\n\nNVIDIA will contribute a product named NIM as a model stack, which are prebuilt AI models that customers can customize for different tasks. NVIDIA defines NIM as \"inference microservices that provide models as optimized containers \u2014 to deploy on clouds, data centers or workstations, giving them the ability to easily build generative AI applications for copilots, chatbots and more, in minutes rather than weeks.\"\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise will contribute the data stack or the operating system for AI, which provides data processing, vectorization (improves the processing speed of AI algorithms), semantic embedding (captures the meaning of data), and more.\n\nHPE will contribute the computing stack, which includes the servers, storage, and networking required to run power-intensive AI models in collaboration. If successful, this collaboration can potentially drive significant revenue for HPE. HPE also plans to bring along its sales channels and partnerships, including Deloitte, HCL, Infosys (INFY), TCS, and Wipro (WIT).\n\nStill, you might wonder why NVIDIA teamed up with HPE when it already has a collaboration with Dell (I discussed this collaboration in my article on Dell). Well, besides NVIDIA wanting as many outlets to sell AI chips as possible, HPE is one of the premier enterprise server companies and has built some of the world's largest computers with NVIDIA. During HPE Discover, CEO Antonio Neri highlighted several high-profile projects that the two companies collaborated on:\n\nNVIDIA has been our visionary partner who share our purpose and commitment to innovation. Over the years, HPE has partnered with NVIDIA to achieve amazing success with our customers in delivering best-in-class AI and supercomputing solutions. One great example of that is the newest Venado supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which is the first U.S. supercomputer to feature the NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs. Another example is our recently signed $200 million deal to build a new supercomputer for one of Japan's largest research institutions, AIST, which we will build in collaboration with NVIDIA using our HPE Cray XD systems, featuring NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThe second and third points in the above image mention green computing and liquid cooling. During my first article on Super Micro Computer (SMCI), I discussed how that company took market share from Dell and HPE. Supermicro actively promotes \"Green Computing\" on its website, and part of that focus is its liquid cooling solutions. In my Supermicro article, I quoted its CEO Charles Liang, who said (emphasis added), \"Our high-power efficiency systems, free-air and liquid-cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success.\" However, Supermicro's edge over its competitors may be more in terms of being the first to actively promote liquid cooling solutions for servers because HPE has had liquid cooling technology for a while now.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nIn the past, liquid cooling may have been less widespread for servers because they can be expensive to install and often require a significant upfront investment. With lower power chips used in traditional servers, air cooling was sufficient. However, with the usage of increasingly higher-powered chips to run generative AI algorithms, liquid cooling is a requirement for AI servers in data centers. Now that HPE emphasizes selling AI servers, management is talking much more about liquid cooling technology. For instance, CEO Neri said on the Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call:\n\nAs accelerated computing, silicon innovation advances, higher power density demands direct liquid cooling technologies building direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well-positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs.\n\nCFO Marie Myers also commented on the company's liquid cooling prowess at the BofA Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference:\n\nLiquid cooling is a skill that HPE has had for decades. And it goes back to the original sort of acquisitions that we did in some of the heavy compute space. And those decades of experience are now going to be very, very beneficial to customers that we talked about like Microsoft. But moreover, as the chips come on board with [NVIDIA AI chip] Blackwell, maybe it's not quite understood that they're going to be completely in need of liquid cooling. And I think that's where HPE has more than 300 patents and decades of experience.\n\nHPE management likely made those statements to emphasize to investors and potential customers that Supermicro is not the only one with liquid cooling technology. Selling AI solutions could provide a nice tailwind for HPE's revenue and free cash flow growth prospects over the next several years. Let's examine the company's second-quarter results and discover how much of an impact AI has had so far.\n\nHPE second quarter FY 2024 Earnings Results\n\nHPE's second-quarter results showed a significant change from the first quarter when the company showed poor conversion of AI server orders into sales. CEO Neri said the following about the poor first-quarter performance in the company first quarter FY 2024 earnings call:\n\nAI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU [AI chip] availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems.\n\nIn other words, HPE couldn't obtain enough AI chips from suppliers (likely NVIDIA), and customers were not ready to receive the servers because the customer's data centers had failed to complete the set-up of the auxiliary equipment needed to run the servers.\n\nThe company displayed much better results in the second quarter. AI systems orders reached $4.6 billion this quarter, showing strong demand for its AI systems. The big difference is that the company converted more of those orders into sales, which grew from around $400 million to over $900 million sequentially. Management attributed the improvement to an improved supply of AI chips.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nCEO Neri said on the second quarter call (emphasis added):\n\nOur lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between six and 12 weeks, depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year.\n\nIn Dell's last reported quarter, the company indicated the traditional enterprise server market was strong, boosted by high demand for AI servers. Dell's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said on the company's first quarter FY 2025 earnings call, \"We've seen an expansion in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions, which remains a significant opportunity for us given we are in the early stages of AI adoption.\" Dell's first fiscal quarter ended on May 3. HPE CEO Neri said a similar thing on its second-quarter FY 2024 earnings call (HPE's fiscal second quarter ended April 30):\n\nEnterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with the number of Enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe image below shows that the server business is the one area showing positive double-digit revenue growth at 18% year-over-year. HPEFS on the image stands for HPE Financial Services, the company's financing arm. The two pieces of good news in the segment results are that the company's largest segment, the Server segment, is also the fastest growing. The second piece of good news is that the Intelligent Edge and Hybrid Cloud segments are in cyclical downturns, are bottoming, and once those areas return to growth, those segments should further boost the company's overall results. I will discuss HPE's other segments in future articles.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThe company's second quarter FY 2024 net revenue of $7.2 billion exceeded the midpoint of company revenue guidance and beat analysts' consensus revenue by $372.61 million.\n\nMargins are a potential issue as we move down the income statement. In the second quarter, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) shrank by 310 basis points to 33.1%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year. CFO Marie Myers said on the earnings call that the gross margin decline was \"driven by a mix shift from our higher margin Intelligent Edge revenue to Server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud.\"\n\nSince the Server segment is the fastest-growing segment, investors should pay attention to this segment's operating margins in future quarters. The CFO noted during the earnings call that \"pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems,\" which means that although there is heavy demand for AI, there is a potential price war for AI servers between Dell, Supermicro, HPE, and other AI server manufacturers.\n\nCash Flow from operations (\"CFO\") to sales is up to 19.51%. This metric shows how efficiently a company can convert sales into cash flow. HPE is significantly better than its peers at converting sales into cash flow. Another positive sign is that its CFO-to-Sales metric is trending up, a potential positive sign for FCF growth.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nCFO said the following about second quarter FCF on the earnings call:\n\nWe generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal 2024, given higher than expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments.\n\nHPE ended the second quarter with $2.67 billion in cash and equivalents against $7.49 billion of long-term debt. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.52, meaning it has approximately half the liabilities as it has equity. The company has a net debt of $9.252 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of $4.893 billion. Therefore, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the second quarter was 1.89. Generally, a company with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than three has a lower risk of defaulting on its debt. It has an interest coverage ratio of 3.4, meaning its EBIT covers its interest payments by an adequate amount.\n\nThe following guidance raised full-year FY 2024 revenue guidance from 0-2% to 1-3% growth. CFO Marie Myers said on the second quarter earnings call, \"We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake.\" However, the company lowered GAAP operating profit growth from 7-11% to 2-6%\u2014ouch.\n\nHPE Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation.\n\nThis earnings report displayed mixed results. On the favorable side, the proliferation of AI should boost revenue growth. On the unfavorable side, the first-quarter and second-quarter earnings reports brought up several risks.\n\nRisks\n\nAlthough sales of AI systems should boost revenue growth, they could hurt margins. Some analysts worry that sales of AI servers might be less profitable in the long term than initially thought for companies like HPE, Dell, and Supermicro, as AI chip suppliers like NVIDIA charge higher prices for their chips and squeeze server manufacturers' margins. HPE may ultimately only produce meaningful margins on the software and other services it provides outside the AI servers.\n\nAdditionally, the server industry is commodity-like with little to no moat, meaning that no one company can differentiate itself for a meaningful period and often competes based on price. Also, Dell is an early leader in AI servers. HPE's AI systems backlog of $3.1 billion is softer than Dell's last reported backlog of $3.8 billion. There is some uncertainty about HPE's strategy to catch up. Since Supermicro and Dell are early leaders in providing AI servers, HPE may eventually decide to compete on price, worsening margins.\n\nDell emphasized using NVIDIA chips almost exclusively in the past, while HPE has used many chips that compete with NVIDIA. So, some analysts think that NVIDIA favors Dell over HPE, a potential reason that Dell had enough chips from NVIDIA to satisfy demand in the same quarter (HPE's first quarter 2024) that HPE had difficulty obtaining enough AI chip supply from NVIDIA to meet its end demand. Some fear that each time NVIDIA brings a new chip to market, it might reward Dell's loyalty by providing it with the new chip before HPE. Suppose that scenario occurs; HPE may have a more challenging time competing, as server customers factor in that they can obtain the latest NVIDIA chips faster from Dell.\n\nValuation\n\nHPE has a price-to-FCF of 9.30, below its three- and five-year median, suggesting an undervalued stock.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nHPE sells at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.25, well below Dell's P/E ratio of 27.81. Still, the difference between the valuations may be justified on a P/E basis due to Dell growing its earnings-per-share (\"EPS\") 67% year-over-year while HPE declined 25%.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe following image shows HPE's forward P/E and year-over-year annual EPS growth estimates from FY 2024 to FY 2026. By FY 2025, the company's Intelligent Edge and Hybrid Cloud business should be out of its cyclical downturn, so let's compare the company's FY 2025 EPS growth estimate of 9.86% to its forward P/E of 10.04. Since the forward EPS growth rate and forward P/E nearly match, HPE is trading at fair value at the closing stock price of $20.92 on June 26, 2024.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe following chart shows HPE's shareholder yield, which is the company's capital return via dividends, net share buybacks, and debt reduction. Generally, the market overvalues a stock when the shareholder yield is low and undervalues it when it is high. The company's shareholder yield of 5.77% is closer to the overvalued side than undervalued.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSeeking Alpha's Quant rates the stock's valuation a C.\n\nHPE is a Hold\n\nAlthough HPE will likely benefit from AI adoption, the market has likely priced in that potential upside. That may be why the stock barely budged after announcing its collaboration with NVIDIA at HPE Discover 2024. Considering the company's risks and the fact that other technology investments may benefit more from increasing generative AI adoption, investors may want to avoid this stock at its current price. Put this stock on a watch list and consider buying it if its shareholder yield rises above 10%. I rate HPE a Hold.",

        "title": "How To Invest $100,000 For Big Dividends From 3 Big Macro Trends",
        "body": "DNY59\n\nDividend investing can be quite challenging in the rapidly changing world in which we find ourselves. Many times, dividend investors may focus on dividend kings and aristocrats (NOBL) with the thought that since their business models have been able to support dividend growth every year for 25 to 50 or more years without any interruptions, they are likely to continue doing so for years to come. While this principle generally holds, there are still some glaring exceptions, as evidenced by recent massive failures by various dividend kings and aristocrats such as Leggett & Platt (LEG), 3M (MMM), AT&T (T), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and even WP Carey (WPC). As a result, simply buying dividend aristocrats and dividend kings blindly is a risky proposition, as you never know when the next shoe will drop from that list. Instead, it may be best to look for businesses that combine attractive fundamentals, dividends, and valuations with major macro tailwinds that can drive them to continued prosperity for years to come.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss stocks that are poised to profit from three macro trends that we see being quite prominent in the coming decade, if not longer: artificial intelligence, soaring geopolitical risks and conflicts, and the onset of stagflation for at least the next few years.\n\n#1. Artificial Intelligence Dividend Investments\n\nFor the portion of the portfolio that could profit from the artificial intelligence boom while still being income-focused, I think the best plays are Broadcom (AVGO) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ). While Broadcom no longer has a high yield due to its strong stock performance in recent years, its 1.4% dividend yield is still on the high end relative to many other major AI stocks. Additionally, the company has a track record of growing its dividend consistently and appears poised to continue doing so for years to come, with analysts expecting it to grow at a near 13% CAGR through 2028, making it a solid dividend growth pick while also leaning into the AI tailwind.\n\nInvestors can complement that by holding JEPQ, which has 52% of its portfolio invested in technology stocks, including all of its top ten holdings positioned to profit from artificial intelligence in some way. These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks. JEPQ implements a notional covered call strategy, enabling it to pay very lucrative monthly dividends equating to an 8.75% trailing 12-month yield. This means that an income investor can significantly boost their portfolio's income generation capabilities while also maintaining significant exposure to leading artificial intelligence plays, including Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN). I also like JEPQ at the moment because I believe the AI space is richly valued, and the covered call strategy implemented by JEPQ takes some of that risk off the table as their strategy exchanges some future upside for cash premiums on the covered calls, which I find attractive given the current market conditions.\n\n#2. Geopolitical Risk Dividend Investments\n\nWhen it comes to rising geopolitical risks, investing in major defense primes like General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) are good bets because they are the leading shipbuilders for the United States Navy. Given that the leading geopolitical challenge is in the Pacific from China, the U.S., along with its AUKUS allies, will likely invest aggressively in expanding its naval capabilities. In fact the U.S. Navy is already investing aggressively towards this end and the Biden administration recently requested even more funds to do so. If Trump gets elected in the Fall, it is highly likely that he will increase this effort even further as he has made building up the U.S. military and countering China a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda if he gets re-elected. This should profit GD and HII significantly. While their current dividend yields of about 2% each are not particularly high, their valuations are reasonable, with HII trading at a 14.9 P/E and GD at a 19.1 P/E. Additionally, both companies should be able to post strong earnings per share and dividend growth in the coming years. For example, HII is expected to grow its dividend per share at a 20% CAGR through 2028, and GD is expected to grow its dividend at about a 10% CAGR in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, I think that Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a worthwhile investment because gold will likely shoot higher from rising geopolitical risks and the continued de-dollarization around the world. Central banks are buying gold hand over fist, and Newmont, with its high-grade mines, provides leveraged exposure to the price of gold. Additionally, its concentration in jurisdictions with lower geopolitical risk should help it hold up well, even if global conflicts intensify.\n\n#3. Stagflation Dividend Investments\n\nWhen it comes to profiting from stagflation, I think buying the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is a good approach since most of the holdings in that ETF are fairly defensive in nature and grow their dividends at a strong clip, which should exceed inflation. However, I believe even better plays are infrastructure and real estate businesses that are not only very defensive and highly contracted in nature but also have inflation-linked revenue escalators. My four favorite picks for this type of investment are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)(BIPC), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)(BEPC), and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) (Enbridge (ENB) isn't a bad substitute for those looking to avoid a K1) in the infrastructure and energy spaces. All three have strong balance sheets, well-diversified portfolios of assets that are highly contracted and/or regulated, and significant inflation protections. W.P. Carey (WPC) is also compelling in the real estate space due to its CPI-linked leases and triple-net lease structure, providing significant cash flow visibility and a very long 12.2-year term to maturity on its leases.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nCombining these stocks into a $100,000 portfolio, I would allocate 15% to JEPQ and 5% to AVGO, giving the portfolio 20% exposure to the AI trade while still generating sufficient current income and dividend growth. For the geopolitical risk trade, I would allocate 5% to GD, 5% to HII, and 10% to NEM, though it may make sense to allocate 5% to Gold (GLD) and 5% to NEM to further mitigate risks. Finally, for the stagflation trade, I would allocate 10% each to EPD, BIP, BEP, and WPC, and 15% to SCHD. The result would be an attractive overall dividend yield along with strong dividend growth, with high single-digit annualized dividend growth expected for SCHD, BIP, BEP, and GD; double-digit annualized dividend growth expected for AVGO and HII; and mid-single-digit dividend growth expected for WPC and EPD. Overall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.",
        "summary": "These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks.\nJEPQ implements a notional covered call strategy, enabling it to pay very lucrative monthly dividends equating to an 8.75% trailing 12-month yield.\nAdditionally, both companies should be able to post strong earnings per share and dividend growth in the coming years.\nThe result would be an attractive overall dividend yield along with strong dividend growth, with high single-digit annualized dividend growth expected for SCHD, BIP, BEP, and GD; double-digit annualized dividend growth expected for AVGO and HII; and mid-single-digit dividend growth expected for WPC and EPD.\nOverall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.",

        "body": "In a month when Nvidia Corp. briefly became the world\u2019s largest company, hedge funds were \u201caggressively\u201d selling tech stocks, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nThis month\u2019s net selling in the US tech sector is on track to be the largest on record going back in data since 2017, according to Goldman\u2019s prime brokerage data. Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by software and internet stocks.\n\nNvidia shares have been choppy after losing $430 billion in market value late last week. And, June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteoric rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. accounted for well over half of the 15% advance in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nThe trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&P 500 hit 33% last week, the highest level in about 24 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds\u2019 momentum exposure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Goldman data showed. \u201cLong concentration\u201d and \u201clong crowdedness\u201d have both seen notable declines and are at the lowest levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a potential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.\n\nThe unwind is not just hitting tech alone. Hedge funds are now tilting more defensively than usual. Their gross leverage \u2014 a measure of risk appetite \u2014 has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold regions so far in June.\n\n\u201cAfter adding risk to their portfolio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk unwinds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers,\u201d Goldman wrote in a note.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-sell-tech-stocks-095749442.html",

A mock-up of the storefront showed a gua sha facial massaging tool, arm weights and phone cases, among other items for sale.\n\nAmazon will ship the products directly from China to the U.S., with the goal of delivering them to shoppers within nine to 11 days, the presentation shows. In the past, Amazon sellers in China have relied on the company\u2019s fulfillment services, called Fulfillment by Amazon, to send goods to warehouses in the U.S. before they are dispatched to customers.\n\nThe company pitched the arrangement as cost savings for Amazon sellers in China, and said merchants would be able to test new items through small-batch production. Shein uses a similar model, referred to as on-demand manufacturing, producing a limited quantity of goods and manufacturing more as demand increases.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said, \u201cWe are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.\u201d\n\nBoschetti declined to comment further on the company\u2019s plans, which were first reported by The Information. It is unclear when Amazon intends to debut the storefront, but the presentation notes it will start accepting products this fall.\n\nChina-based merchants have made up a sizable contingent of Amazon\u2019s marketplace for many years, but the company is making a renewed push to court sellers there as it faces growing competition. In December, Amazon announced a new \u201cinnovation center\u201d in Shenzhen, a popular technology and manufacturing hub, and it also slashed the fees it charges merchants selling clothing priced below $20.\n\nAmazon said in 2023 the number of items sold by Chinese sellers on its site grew more than 20% year over year, while the number of Chinese merchants with sales upward of $10 million increased 30%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/amazon-plans-discount-store-in-bid-to-fend-off-temu-and-shein.html",

        "body": "Walgreens on Thursday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.\n\nThe retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company\u2019s previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\u2033\u2019We assumed.. in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\u201d but \u201cthat is not the case,\u201d Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn\u2019t actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we\u2019ve had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\u201d\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\u201c75% of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\u201d Wentworth said. \u201cWhat that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close\u2026\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Walgreens reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported a net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with a net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nExcluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.\n\nWalgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.\n\nStrong performance in health-care division\n\nWalgreens reported growth across its three business divisions in the fiscal third quarter. But the company\u2019s U.S. health-care unit stood out, as sales jumped 7.6% compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nRevenue for the segment came in at $2.13 billion. Analysts had expected sales of $2.08 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nThe company said the higher sales reflect primary care provider VillageMD and specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions. Shields saw sales jump 24% during the period, driven by growth within existing partnerships.\n\nSpecialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThose results come one quarter after Walgreens posted a steep net loss as it recorded a hefty nearly $6 billion charge related to the decline in value of its investment in VillageMD. The company now plans to shutter 160 VillageMD clinics, executives announced during the company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings call in March.\n\n\u201cWe are working with their management team to ultimately still be an investor, but meaningfully reduce our investment as well as gain some liquidity so that we can invest back in the retail pharmacy business that represents our future,\u201d Wentworth told CNBC of the company\u2019s investment in VillageMD.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $28.5 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 2.3% from the same period last year. Analysts had expected sales of $28.34 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nThat segment operates more than 8,000 drugstores across the U.S., which sell prescription and nonprescription drugs as well as health and wellness, beauty, personal care, and food products.\n\nThe company said that sales growth came entirely from comparable pharmacy sales and partially offset by a decline in retail revenue.\n\nWalgreens said pharmacy sales for the quarter rose 4.4% and comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7% compared to the year-earlier period due to price inflation in brand medications and prescription growth.\n\nTotal prescriptions filled in the quarter including vaccines totaled 306.4 million, a 0.5% increase from the same period a year ago.\n\nRetail sales for the quarter fell 4% from the prior-year quarter, and comparable retail sales declined 2.3%. The company pointed to a \u201cchallenging\u201d retail environment, among other factors.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 international segment, which operates more than 3,000 retail stores abroad, posted $5.73 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter. That\u2019s an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html",

        "body": "By Technical or fundamental analysis: which one is better for long-term investing? Myriad investors use one or the other technique on its own seemingly successfully, but using only one presents significant limitations.\n\nUsing a combination of both could be the ultimate winning strategy. Although the topic of technical analysis is controversial among a certain group of Wall Street investors, recent data points toward its importance when investing for the future.\n\nA study from March 2023 by Fidelity Investments\u2019 Vice President of Advanced Analytics and Insights Jasleen Kaur and a professor at the School of Business Studies in India Khushdeep Dharni looked at two different strategies of investing using advanced mathematics and computer software to mine the data necessary for more profitable trading.\n\nComputer algorithms examined both technical indicators and fundamental data across over 381 companies, showing that data-mining techniques incorporating elements of both technical and fundamental analysis led to better investment returns than a pure buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nSifting through a huge pile of data seems much easier with the rise of faster technology, but the core principles behind the platforms with automated tools have been around for a long time and could still be used by a qualified person to reach the same results.\n\nConducting fundamental analysis is crucial when evaluating stocks. One should have a comprehensive understanding of a company\u2019s financial health and performance. The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component \u2014 will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that\u2019ll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.\n\nThere\u2019s widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing. Although important, on its own it could prove to be limiting. For example, if one evaluates the stock and does not look at the current chart and volume movement, one could buy an overpriced stock right before the price is set to crash.\n\nThe second step, which is also of significance, involves conducting technical analysis. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time. If used in isolation, one could buy a stock of a company that is about to go under and lose all the investment. Meanwhile, the data shows that technical analysis is just as important.\n\nWhile the United States and India have very different markets, markets around the world are similar in terms of behavioral psychology and the research findings are true for investors around the globe in many ways.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s as hard to predict where the market will turn next as it is to predict the future. Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.\n\nIt\u2019s important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone\u2019s piece of advice. Diligent research is paramount \u2014 looking for and evaluating the newest research is crucial.",

        "body": "Introduction:\n\nFerrari (RACE) is a well-known auto manufacturer that produces vehicles that are the pinnacle of the automobile industry. Having a legendary status and a fiercely loyal fan base, Tifosi. RACE relentlessly protects its brand image. Limiting the number of vehicles sold per year, who it sells its cars to, and even controlling where its product ends up online. This fierce protection of brand image is because most of Ferrari\u2019s value comes from its strong brand goodwill that rivals the likes of Google, Disney, and even Coke. Ferrari is so adamant about protecting their brand image that it even opposes engaging in M&A, as it believes that doing so will dilute the Ferrari company's unique genetics. (SOURCE)\n\nMarket:\n\nSouth Korea\n\nTaking a look at each country\u2019s attitude towards luxury goods, South Korea is the most receptive towards luxury goods (SOURCE). On top of that, globally South Korea is also ranked 13 in terms of GDP (SOURCE). This means that South Korea is the target market for RACE given their willingness to purchase luxury and their ability to purchase luxury. However, the number of shipments to South Korea is so small that RACE does not report the individual country\u2019s % contribution.\n\nChina\n\n\u201cYoung market...the number of car that we shipped with this market is not so big.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. China is a big opportunity for RACE for several reasons 1) China is a rapidly growing economy thanks to massive government subsidies and cheaper labor, which means that there are more and more wealthy citizens. 2) China\u2019s culture cares about \u201cFace\u201d. Face is, in essence, social status. Having a luxury car in China is seen as a status symbol. RACE doesn't intend to rapidly expand in China as it is trying to control the supply of Ferraris in China to create the impression of scarcity and drum up value. However, I believe that the growing class of wealthy individuals in China represents a large opportunity for RACE.\n\nLuxury Goods\n\nThere is a growing distinction between \u201cNew Money\u201d and \u201cOld Money\u201d. Old Money means generational wealth where they prefer less flashy but significantly higher-quality products, \u201cStealth Wealth\u201d. Whereas New Money means a growing group of people who transitioned above the middle class, they see the need to buy flashy products with strong logos to flaunt their wealth. There is also a growing desire amongst younger people to purchase luxury goods due to social media constantly promoting these goods, creating the impression that to own a luxury product is to be part of an exclusive group, playing into the large FOMO factor of this demographic. As an example, 62% of GUCCI\u2019s customers are under 35 (SOURCE) This distinction means that the demographic of customers purchasing luxurious goods is not the ultra-wealthy but the rising upper middle class. So, I believe that RACE's main demographic is the younger New Money crowd.\n\nRevenue:\n\nCars and Spare Parts\n\n\u201cCars and Spare Parts\u201d include selling Ferrari cars, their spare parts, and personalization. Taking a look at data from (SOURCE)\n\nWhen forecasting the number of shipments, from FY11 to FY23 the number of Ferrari shipped grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 6.00%. I assumed that this growth rate would tick slightly upwards as RACE pushes out its electric vehicle line-up and its new Purosangue line-up. However, in perpetuity, I assumed that RACE would taper the growth rate of their shipments down towards historical averages to keep the total number of Ferraris on the road low to maintain the brand\u2019s image.\n\nWhen forecasting the Revenue/Shipment, I believe that in the earlier years of my forecast due to RACE pushing out their newer EVs, they would not increase prices to a large extent. However, over time due to the growth in the number of wealthy people (SOURCE), RACE would increase the sale price of their cars to control the number of Ferrari on the road and maintain the luxurious image of a Ferrari. I also believe that over time as Personalization becomes more prevalent in the Ferrari experience (SOURCE), RACE can charge a higher amount. I believe that in perpetuity, Revenue/Shipment grows at a slightly higher rate than the perpetual inflation rate. As Ferraris are luxury goods, they command a higher premium and are likely to attract consumers who are price-inelastic.\n\nSponsorship, Commercial and Brand\n\n\u201cSponsorship, Commercial and Brand\u201d includes brand sponsorship Ferrari earns from F1 and other racing events and any merchandise sold.\n\nThe main value driver behind Ferrari isn\u2019t the fact that they\u2019ve managed to raise their revenue but rather it\u2019s because the Ferrari branding has become more and more valuable over time due to their prominence in motorsports. As a proxy, I took a look at professional soccer teams, soccer teams have massively low margins attributable to a few factors such as 1) Uncertainty in performance and 2) inflating player salaries. A sports team can\u2019t control how it will perform as every sport is very dynamic with multiple unpredictable factors at play, consistently poor performance will lead to the team losing fans, and in turn, since there are less monetizable eyeballs the team will end up losing sponsorship deals. The valuation of these sports teams is largely based on precedent transactions as there are no stable cash flows that these teams can generate. In the case of F1 where there are only 10 teams, there is not much competition for talent which negates the issue of inflating player salaries. RACE has also been consistently placing in the top spots in F1. So, Ferrari hopes it can leverage this branding to appeal to sponsors.\n\nWhen forecasting the number of sponsors, I took a look at the number of sponsors to Ferrari\u2019s F1 team, Scuderia Ferrari. This is so as Ferrari places heavy emphasis on their F1 team specifically mentioning their importance to Ferrari\u2019s strong brand recognition. And, \u201cFormula 1 is a channel through which Ferrari's potential target audience can be reached directly\u201d (SOURCE). I believe to not overly dilute the value of being a team sponsor, RACE caps the number of sponsors at 40.\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Sponsor, sponsorship is mainly for advertising purposes which is a cyclical expenditure that explains the recent decline in the growth rate of revenue/sponsor. I assumed that in the first 2 years of my forecast, given the uncertainty in macro conditions advertising spending would remain depressed. However, ultimately, as the Ferrari brand increases in value so will the sponsorship amount. In perpetuity, I assumed that revenue/sponsor would grow at a slightly higher rate than the perpetual inflation rate.\n\nEngines\n\n\u201cEngines\u201d includes any engine sold to Maserati and other F1 teams. However \u201cMaserati whose contract expired at the end of 2023. Therefore, from the first quarter 2024 onward, any residual contribution from the sales of engine and spare parts, whether for sport cars or racing, will be reported in the bar, named others.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, I lumped Engines and Others together.\n\nCost:\n\nCOGS\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, RACE incurs higher costs in their earlier years of producing the new line-up of EVs. I assumed that over time as RACE\u2019s supply chain matures they can maintain their historic margins. According to (SOURCE), RACE\u2019s pre-covid margins hovered around 52%.\n\nSG&A and Others\n\nWhen forecasting the Number of Employees, Cost/Employee, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages.\n\nR&D\n\nGiven management\u2019s push towards producing higher quality EVs, it has led to a lot of front-loaded R&D expenditure in FY21, which management ended up cutting back in FY22 and FY23. So, when forecasting R&D I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast R&D expenditure would remain at recent historical levels before tapering back to 18.5% at pre-covid levels\n\nTaxes:\n\nGiven that RACE is incorporated in The Netherlands, the marginal tax rate is 25.80% (SOURCE. So, in perpetuity, I assumed that RACE would pay taxes at 25.80%.\n\nWACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.37%\n\nStable Market ERP (SOURCE) = 4.60%\n\nBeta (SOURCE) = 1.01\n\nCOE = 9.02%\n\nRACE has no bond rating. So, I decided to apply a synthetic rating from (SOURCE)\n\nFY23 EBIT = 1617.37M\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 29.26M\n\nFY23 Interest Coverage Ratio = 55.3x\n\nBy Synthetic Rating, RACE would be rated \u201cAAA\u201d, given that The Netherlands is also rated \u201cAAA\u201d. RACE is appropriate to be rated AAA.\n\nAAA Bond Yield = 4.37%\n\nMarginal Tax Rate = 25.80%\n\nAT COD = 3.24%\n\nStock Price (5D Avg) = $390.20\n\nShares O/S = 243.75M\n\nMarket Value of Equity = 95111.25M\n\nWeighted Average Maturity of Debt = 3 Years.\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 29.26M\n\nMarket Value of Debt = 2005.61M\n\n%Debt =2.07%\n\n%Equity = 97.93%\n\n%WACC = 8.90%\n\nConclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value RACE at $267.31 per share. I believe that RACE is heavily overvalued as investors highly value the goodwill built by RACE. The function for shipment revenue is the quantity shipped and price per shipment. RACE faces a dilemma where if they increase their quantity shipped it would increase revenue but at the same time dilute the value of the Ferrari brand. There is a possibility that management could increase the other variable instead, but I am skeptical at what pace is management able to raise it comfortably. I believe that the road forward for RACE is to lean more heavily into its merchandise to remain in the public consciousness and to continue building brand goodwill.\n\nBase Case: [INSERT]\n\nBest Case: [INSERT]\n\nWorst Case: [INSERT]\n\nSanity Check: [INSERT]\n\nRevenue Model: [INSERT]\n\nCost Model: [INSERT]\n\nChange in NWC Schedule: [INSERT]\n\nDebt Schedule: [INSERT]",

        "body": "One must wonder why both the stock market and housing market are both at all time highs? The median price of a home sold in May was $419,300 \u2014 an all-time record. As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the dot.com bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the dot.com boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!\n\nMAV",

        "body": "Automated trading is the process of using computer programs and algorithms to automate trading strategies in the financial markets. Instead of manual execution, traders rely on trading robots that automatically analyze the market, make decisions, and execute trades.\n\nWhat is the advantage of automating analysis?\n\nFirst, it allows traders to react to market events much faster than manual trading. Platforms can instantly analyze and interpret huge amounts of data, which makes rapid decision-making possible.\n\nSecond, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error. Traders can be emotionally stressed, which can lead to irrational decisions. Trading robots work based on predetermined algorithms without the influence of emotion, which increases the discipline of trading and the prospect of an initially working strategy,\n\nTechnical analysis and automated decision making\n\nTrading robots are based on technical analysis, analyzing historical data of prices, volumes and other parameters. They can automatically make decisions to enter and exit trades based on set conditions such as support and resistance levels, indicators and market trends.\n\nAutomated trading software\n\nThere is a variety of automated trading software available. Some platforms offer off-the-shelf solutions, including trading robots and tools to incorporate into their own strategies. Other platforms offer APIs that allow traders to create their own programs based on specified conditions.\n\nFunctionality and features\n\nAutomated trading software can offer a variety of features and functionality. These can include real-time feedback, data visualization, tools to optimize strategies, backtesting and testing capabilities on historical data, and risk and portfolio management.\n\nPros and cons of automated trading\n\nAutomated trading has several advantages. First, it allows traders to greatly increase their speed of reaction to market events, as robots can instantly analyze and make decisions. Second, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error.\n\nHowever, automated trading also has its limitations and risks. Technical glitches, market connectivity issues, and software bugs can lead to lost trades or even financial losses. In addition, trading robots can be sensitive to changes in market conditions and may not always be able to adapt to new situations.\n\nHow to choose the right trading robot or software\n\nConsider your requirements and goals\n\nWhen choosing a trading robot or software, you need to consider your individual requirements and goals. Different robots and platforms may offer different features and strategies, so it is important to determine what you need and what best suits your trading goals.\n\n2. Testing and optimizing strategies\n\nOnce you have chosen your software, it is recommended that you test and optimize your strategies on historical data. This will help you verify the effectiveness of your chosen robot and customize its parameters according to your preferences and trading strategies.\n\nExamples of successful use of automated trading\n\nExample 1: Increasing Profitability with a Trading Robot\n\nOne example of a successful use of automated trading is the case of a trader who was able to significantly increase his profitability through the use of a trading robot. The robot analyzed market data and made decisions about entering and exiting trades based on predetermined algorithms and strategies. This allowed the trader to reduce emotional errors and increase his trading efficiency.\n\nExample 2: Reducing emotional errors and increasing discipline\n\nAnother example of the successful use of automated trading has to do with reducing emotional errors and increasing trader discipline. Trading robots are not subject to emotional stress and do not succumb to panic or greed,",

If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on _____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: US Recurring Jobless Claims Rise to Highest Since End of 2021\n\nMostly earnings aftermaths today.\n\nMU- Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn\u2019t as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)\n\nWBA- Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs. CVS down in sympathy.\n\nLEVI- Reported revenue of 1.44B vs 1.45 expected, and EPS of $0.16 vs $0.04. Beat expectations, but CFO warned that consumers have been \u201cgenerally cautious\u201d about spending.\n\nAMZN- Hitting all time highs, watching 195/200 levels. No \u201cnew news\u201d beyond that, so mainly will be patient for this one.\n\nRIVN- No new news beyond the Volkswagen investment, but still watching this.\n\nEarnings today: NKE\n\nIPO today: WBTN (Webtoon, extremely interested in this)",

They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.\n\nNow, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed \u201cuniversal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,\u201d including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.\n\nMr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.",

Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.\n\nDespite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they\u2019d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person\u2019s politics?\n\nThis year, Ms. Lunz Trujillo, now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, was reading a new, best-selling book that cited her research to explore those same questions.

        "title": "A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business",
        "body": "Talking points\n\nAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.\n\nThere will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here\u2019s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate \u201cbingo card\u201d further below.)\n\nThe economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?\n\nInflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they\u2019re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 \u2014 an economy many Americans want back.\n\nTaxes: Biden\u2019s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: \u201cIt\u2019s simple math,\u201d David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don\u2019t like Biden\u2019s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.\n\nProtectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.\n\nMarkets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night\u2019s debate, \u201cmarkets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping \u201csome continuity.\u201d\n\nOther issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue \u2014 and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:\n\nFor Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.\n\nFor Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.",

        "title": "Help! Qatar Airways Denied Us Boarding Because of a Broken Link.",
        "body": "Dear Tripped Up,\n\nI am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a \u201cHealth Declaration Form\u201d in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn\u2019t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets \u2014 we received $1,185 \u2014 but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan\n\nDear Elizabeth,\n\nYour run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding \u201cthousands of times a day,\u201d said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.\n\nNot to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.\n\nCountries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week\u2019s vacation. But travel can be complicated \u2014 consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways\u2019 hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.",

Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.\n\nSince 2012, the Affordable Care Act has mandated that private insurance plans cover the \u201cfull range\u201d of contraceptives for women approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including female sterilizations, emergency contraceptives and any new products cleared by the F.D.A.

Some plans might cover only generic versions of certain contraceptives, but patients are still entitled to coverage of a specific product that their providers deem medically necessary.

Interest payments alone are eating up 27 percent of the revenue collected.\n\nThe Kenyan president, William Ruto, had promoted the tax bill as necessary to avoid defaulting on the country\u2019s debt, but the violent reaction to Parliament\u2019s approval prompted Mr. Ruto to abruptly reverse course on Wednesday and reject the legislation he had asked for. \u201cListening keenly to the people of Kenya,\u201d he said, \u201cI will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subsequently be withdrawn.\u201d He proposed a 14-day period of discussions to chart a new economic course.\n\nMr. Ruto\u2019s turnaround may have temporarily quieted protests, but it leaves the country\u2019s finances more precarious than before.

Vacay, a personalized travel planning tool, presented me with a list of questions, while Mindtrip, a new A.I. travel assistant, invited me to take a quiz. (ChatGPT, the third assistant, asked nothing.)\n\nVacay\u2019s and Mindtrip\u2019s questions were similar: Are you traveling solo? What\u2019s your budget? Do you prefer hotels or Airbnbs? Would you rather explore the great outdoors or pursue a cultural experience?\n\nEventually, my chat sessions yielded what seemed like well-rounded itineraries, starting with one day in Oslo and moving on to the fjord region. Eventually, I locked down a trip that would combine the assistants\u2019 information and go beyond a predictable list of sites.",

Notions of Edenic riverbanks came from my mom reading \u201cThe Wind in the Willows\u201d out loud after dinner \u2014 not from encounters with the actual river that flowed 330 yards from our front door.\n\nLater, I came to associate the Housatonic with sorrow. An arched bridge over it, which I crossed on my walk to high school, marked the transition from home to the stresses of my teenage years. I learned, too, that reaches of the river acclaimed by Melville, Ives and Longfellow were laden with PCBs, an industrial pollutant.\n\nTourists, taking their cue from locals, have only rarely ventured down to the Housatonic\u2019s banks. But in recent years, the river\u2019s cleanup (the next stages of which remain a source of fierce community debate) has reminded everyone who loves the Berkshires that the Housatonic needs our attention and \u2014 whether from a canoe or a riverside trail \u2014 abundantly rewards our affection.",

Trade hostilities between Washington and Beijing were undermining the benefits of depending on plants in China. President Donald J. Trump had slapped tariffs on a broad variety of Chinese imports, increasing their prices, and President Biden extended that policy.\n\nMelissa & Doug was eager to shift some production to other countries. Which explained the arrival of its chief supply chain officer at a factory in Greater Noida, a fast-growing city about 30 miles southeast of the Indian capital, New Delhi.\n\nThe factory was owned by a family business called Sunlord. The Melissa & Doug executive was surprised to see that the plant could make high-quality wooden toys, at prices comparable to those in China.

The league has stuck to this approach even as Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other leagues moved more of their games onto cable and satellite broadcasters and subscription streaming services.\n\nThe strategy has paid off: Ninety-three of the 100 most-watched programs on television last year were N.F.L. games, according to Nielsen.\n\nYet N.F.L. games are not cheap and ubiquitous enough for all fans. This month, the league has been in federal court in Los Angeles fending off a class-action suit brought by millions of customers who paid for Sunday Ticket, the subscription service on DirecTV that showed all out-of-market games on Sundays.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that the N.F.L. colluded with CBS and Fox to artificially inflate the price of the service, which cost roughly $300 a season, because the networks viewed Sunday Ticket as competition. The plaintiffs argue that the N.F.L. dismissed offers to create cheaper services that would have let fans buy games based on teams. They are seeking damages of $7 billion, which could be tripled under antitrust statutes. That could take a significant bite out the league\u2019s annual media rights, which are now worth more than $10 billion a year.",

If you're looking for evidence of this trend, nowhere is it more apparent than the list of the world's largest companies when measured by market cap.\n\nMicrosoft, at the forefront of AI-powered assistants, boasts a market cap of $3.37 trillion, ahead of the previous champ. Apple, at $3.27 trillion, has dabbled in AI for more than a decade and recently announced sweeping AI updates for many of its devices. Nvidia has been the poster child of AI chipmakers and the third company to sport a market cap of more than $3 trillion. The leaders are followed closely by Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all leaders in generative AI -- with market caps of between $1.31 trillion and $2.29 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of roughly $891 billion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is on track to join this elite group of businesses, probably sooner than later. The adoption of AI continues to gain ground, buoying demand for chips used in the process. As the world's largest semiconductor foundry, TSMC seems destined to join this exclusive fraternity.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA chip off the old block\n\nAfter years of operating in relative obscurity, it appears TSMC's time in the limelight has come. The company describes itself as the \"world's largest and best semiconductor foundry,\" occupying an enviable position in the AI revolution. More specifically, AI processing requires state-of-the-art semiconductors, and TSMC is the chipmaker to the stars. Its biggest customers include Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among many others.\n\nHowever, the trajectory of the business has shifted in recent years. TSMC once relied on smartphone chips for the bulk of its revenue, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes specialized chips used for processing AI, has become the company's biggest moneymaker, recently representing 46% of sales.\n\nTSMC's growth is accelerating. Revenue grew 16.5% year over year to $18.9 billion in the first quarter, while earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 crept 5% higher, as the company boosted research and development (R&D) spending to keep up with evolving technology.\n\nThe company is expecting this growth spurt to continue. Management's outlook is calling for second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, or growth of about 28%. That forecast could end up being conservative. In April and May, the company reported revenue growth of 60% and 30% year over year, respectively, far outpacing management's projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nTSMC occupies a noteworthy space in the AI ecosystem. Since its processors are used by many of the biggest names in the space, TSMC stands to benefit from the accelerating adoption of generative AI -- which has created much of the buzz over the past year or so. Furthermore, its accelerating revenue provides evidence that management is leaning into this opportunity. As such, it should soon vault TSMC into the company of trillionaires.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $85.17 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 10.5. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $95 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nWhat's even more intriguing is that Wall Street is already forecasting revenue growth of 32% and 22% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. If the company clears those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $1 trillion market cap sometime in 2025. However, given the excitement surrounding AI, it could happen even sooner.\n\nThe runway for growth ahead is compelling. During the first-quarter earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI-related revenue] to grow at 50% CAGR [compound annual growth rate] and to increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\"\n\nEstimates regarding the continued proliferation of AI support his conclusions. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next 10 years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. It's worth noting that even the most conservative estimates have been trending higher as new use cases for AI are discovered.\n\nFinally, at 27 times forward earnings, TSMC's valuation is compelling, offering a less-pricey way to invest in the massive opportunity represented by AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett donates again to the Gates Foundation but will cut the charity off after his death",
        "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Investor Warren Buffett announced another $5.3 billion in charitable gifts Friday, but in a major shift of his longtime giving plan he said he plans to cut off donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after his death and let his three children decide how to distribute the rest of his $128 billion fortune.\n\nBuffett laid out his new plan for his estate in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. The 93-year-old billionaire who leads Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press on Friday about his plan that calls for Howard, Susie and Peter Buffett to unanimously agree where to give his Berkshire Hathaway stock after his death.\n\nBuffett has given about $55 billion worth of Berkshire stock to five foundations since he outlined his giving plan in 2006, with the biggest share by far going to the Gates Foundation. The other four foundations are affiliated with his family, including the ones each of his children run.\n\n\u201cThe Gates Foundation has no money coming after my death,\u201d said Buffett, who left the Gates Foundation's board in 2021 after Bill Gates, one of his best friends, announced he and Melinda French Gates were divorcing. French Gates left the Gates Foundation earlier this year.\n\nIn his initial pledge to the Gates Foundation in 2006, Buffett wrote that he planned to include the foundation in his will. \u201cI will soon write a new will that will provide for a continuance of this commitment \u2014 by distribution of the remaining earmarked shares or in some other manner \u2014 after my death,\u201d he wrote then, referring to the annual gifts of Berkshire Hathaway stock that he was pledging.\n\nBut Buffett said in a statement Friday that his original pledges are only good until his death.\n\nBuffett will leave it up to his kids to decide what to do with his Berkshire stock, much like he does now when he lets the foundations decide how to use his gifts. He said they already know the goal of his giving.\n\n\u201cIt should be used to help the people that haven\u2019t been as lucky as we have been,\u201d Buffett told the Journal. \u201cThere\u2019s eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we\u2019ve been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There\u2019s lots of ways to help people.\u201d\n\nMark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, said in a statement that he appreciates Buffett's generosity over the years.\n\n\u201cWarren Buffett has been exceedingly generous to the Gates Foundation through more than 18 years of contributions and advice,\" Suzman said. \"He has played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation\u2019s work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life. We are deeply grateful for his most recent gift and contributions totaling approximately $43 billion to our work.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe value of Buffett\u2019s donations have grown with the steady rise in price of Berkshire\u2019s stock, so the stock he has given away to date is already worth more than his entire fortune of $43 billion when he announced his plan. The conglomerate\u2019s most widely traded Class B shares are up about 22% in the just past 12 months.\n\n\u201cNothing extraordinary has occurred at Berkshire; a very long runway, simple but generally sound capital deployment, the American tailwind and compounding effects produced my current wealth,\u201d Buffett said in a statement. \u201cMy will provides that more than 99% of my estate is destined for philanthropic usage.\u201d\n\nBuffett's own Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation has been a major supporter of abortion rights over the years, but he has let his children and the Gates Foundation make their own decisions about how to distribute his gifts. Howard Buffett has given more than $500 million to help Ukraine since Russia invaded as part of his focus on helping war-torn regions.\n\nBuffett also occasionally makes other gifts to unnamed charities but he hasn't ever disclosed the details of those gifts.\n\nBuffett will still own 207,963 Class A Berkshire shares and 2,586 Class B shares after giving away a little over 13 million Class B shares Friday. Because of the voting power of the Class A shares, Buffett continues to have the biggest say by far in the operations of the massive conglomerate based in Omaha, Nebraska that he leads as chairman and CEO. He hasn't bought or sold any Berkshire shares in the past 18 years.\n\nBuffett has said that one of his vice chairman, Greg Abel, who already oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, will take over as CEO after he is gone. Berkshire owns an eclectic assortment of manufacturing, retail and service businesses including BNSF railroad, several large utilities, Dairy Queen and Precision Castparts. Insurance companies, including Geico and General Reinsurance, are also a core part of Berkshire, and the company owns a huge stock portfolio dominated by iconic companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express and Bank of America.\n\nBuffett's son Howard, who already serves on Berkshire's board, is slated to become chairman after his father's death, but Buffett's children won't play an active role in the day-to-day operations of the company.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report from New York.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

        "body": "One of the biggest themes in the markets for the last two years has been artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNaturally, famed entrepreneur Elon Musk has found himself at the center of the AI revolution -- and he just gave investors a big reason to seriously consider both Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nLet's explore how Musk is working with these AI leaders, and assess if these stocks are good buys right now.\n\nWhat did Elon Musk just say?\n\nIn addition to running Tesla and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is also managing an AI start-up, called xAI.\n\nxAI is building a chatbot called Grok, and is aiming to compete with the likes of OpenAI. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI but abandoned the project back in 2018. Since his departure, Musk has gotten into many publicized tiffs with OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, over safety concerns and how AI should be used in society.\n\nIn early June, Musk revealed that xAI will be utilizing a series of AI chips from Nvidia. The entrepreneur followed up this announcement with another exciting development.\n\nSMC -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2024\n\nNamely, Musk took to X to tell investors and AI enthusiasts that xAI will be partnering with Dell and Supermicro to build its AI infrastructure such as server rack solutions and factory architecture.\n\nHow Dell and Supermicro stand to benefit\n\nAI has many different components. One of the biggest bellwethers for AI at the moment are specialized chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are used to train large language models and other computing functions to develop generative AI applications.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is the undisputed leader of AI chips -- owning an estimated 80% share of the market.\n\nHowever, deploying chips into machine learning models and other use cases is only part of the broader equation. Companies such as Dell and Supermicro specialize in a different area within the chip realm.\n\nBoth Dell and Supermicro are major players in AI infrastructure solutions. Essentially, both companies specialize in designing integrated systems architecture, server racks, and storage clusters for data centers.\n\nConsidering xAI just raised $6 billion in funding back in May, Dell and Supermicro appear well positioned to benefit from AI tailwinds as xAI moves swiftly to catch up with the competition.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDell, Supermicro, both, or neither?\n\nOn the surface, owning different businesses across the semiconductor landscape might be a good idea. AI is still in its infancy, and there are many different applications among chip companies that are playing a role in the technology's development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, a close look at valuation should shed some light on investing in Dell and Supermicro in particular.\n\nDELL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Dell and Supermicro over the last few years. While neither stock looks cheap, Dell is clearly trading at a noticeable discount to Supermicro. With that said, Supermicro's premium is arguably warranted considering how fast the company is growing.\n\nMoreover, one of my biggest knocks against Supermicro has been that the company relies heavily on business from Nvidia -- a dynamic that could hurt the company in the long run as more companies design competing chips.\n\nNow, with a nod of approval from Musk and xAI, I'm more optimistic about Supermicro's prospects of branching out and earning meaningful business from new customers in the AI space.\n\nAt the end of the day, allocating a portion of your AI holdings to both Dell and Supermicro could be a good idea for long-term investors. If I had to just choose one company, I think Dell is the better value compared to Supermicro based on its lower P/E and diversified business. Considering Supermicro is still relatively small, I think its valuation needs to continue normalizing before it looks like a bargain opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- To interest-rate strategists at Barclays Plc watching the presidential debate Thursday night, the trade was clear: buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWith former president Donald Trump appearing more likely to unseat Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election, the market should \u201cbe pricing in a considerable risk of higher-than-target inflation in the coming years, and this is from a starting point of our thinking they already offered structural value,\u201d Barclays strategists Michael Pond and Jonathan Hill said in a note.\n\nThe simple trade, they wrote, is a wager that five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, will outperform regular five-year Treasuries, leading to a wider yield spread between the two. That breakeven rate \u2014 representing the market-implied expectation for the average inflation rate of the consumer price index over the life of the securities \u2014 will widen to 2.5% from about 2.25% currently, Barclays projects.\n\nTrump has proposed steep tariffs on imports, particularly on goods from China, and an aggressive effort to deport those working in the US illegally. He has also pledged to extend across-the-board tax cuts, which would likely worsen the federal deficit and add stimulus to an economy that the Federal Reserve is seeking to restrain.\n\nAt 2.25%, the five-year breakeven rate suggests that the market\u2019s expectation for CPI are in line with the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the strategists said. The Fed targets a different inflation gauge \u2014 the price index for personal consumption expenditures \u2014 which averages 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than the CPI.\n\nInflation continues to exceed the Fed\u2019s target rate, but by shrinking margins.

The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, also rose 2.6%, the slowest increase since March 2021.\n\nBut if the odds in the coming months continue to favor a second Trump term, \u201cwe would expect them to be embedded in the market via higher breakevens as the November elections approach,\u201d Pond and Hill wrote.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors of all time, and his track record supports that.\n\nSince taking control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's managed to increase the value of the business by 4,974,948%. That's a practically incomprehensible number, so I'll put it a different way: If you invested in Berkshire Hathaway when Buffett took over, you'd have more than 138 times the wealth you'd have if you'd just bought and held the S&P 500.\n\nBuffett took Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile business and turned it into a conglomerate with a huge insurance business and equity portfolio at its center. Investors watch Berkshire's equity portfolio changes closely to try to glean ideas from the Oracle of Omaha. But Buffett's been selling a lot more stocks than he's been buying lately.\n\nThere's one investment Buffett's been piling money into during the past year, though. Berkshire's position in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds increased by more than $58 billion over the past year as Buffett funds new purchases with stock sales and cash flows from Berkshire's core business. And he said he expects to add another $11 billion in the second quarter.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe only short-term investment Buffett likes\n\nBuffett is well-known as a long-term investor. He's famously quoted as saying \"our favorite holding period is forever\" when it comes to his best investment ideas for Berkshire. But not every investment should be held forever.\n\nIndeed, Buffett views short-term Treasuries as the best place to hold excess cash while he looks for good long-term investment opportunities. Practically all of Berkshire's cash gets invested in Treasury bonds that mature within one year, most within six months.\n\nBuffett explains why he insists on keeping funds in short-term government bonds in every quarterly report. \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments,\" he wrote in Berkshire's first-quarter earnings release.\n\nFor now, he's getting both safety and yield. Treasuries maturing within six months yield about 5.3%, as of this writing, more than a percentage point higher than the 10-year Treasury note. That's not typically the case. The inverted yield curve is the result of expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower rates over the next few years.\n\nBuffett hasn't always been a staunch advocate of short-term government bonds. It's a lesson learned from experience. He bought long-dated government bonds in the 1970s and later felt the impact of inflation on the investment. \"It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we did,\" he wrote in his 1979 letter to shareholders. \"We made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at losses, if necessary) when our present views began to crystallize.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe would much rather take a lower yield and let the bond reach maturity, then reinvest the proceeds at market rates, than gamble on where interest rates will be during the next 15 years. The fact that short-term bonds currently yield more than 5% is just icing on the cake. At Berkshire's 2024 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett said he'd still be sitting on short-term Treasuries even if yields were 1%.\n\nBuffett's going to keep buying\n\nDuring his opening remarks at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in May, Buffett predicted the company's cash and Treasury holdings will surpass $200 billion by the end of the second quarter. That's an $11 billion increase from the end of last quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nThat's tough to find, especially because \"a lot of money\" is now very different for Berkshire than it used to be -- its market value has ballooned to nearly $900 billion. \"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\" Buffett wrote in his most recent letter to shareholders. And he's not going to buy one unless it's attractively priced and has a margin of safety.\n\nBuffett's managed to add small amounts of some major businesses over the past year. He most recently took a large stake in Chubb, the insurance company. He continues to add to his stake in Occidental Petroleum. And Berkshire's also buying up large amounts of Liberty SiriusXM ahead of its merger with Sirius XM later this year.\n\nBut those purchases are relatively small compared to the amount of free cash flow that the core Berkshire Hathaway operations are generating every quarter. And with Buffett selling some stocks to take profits and take advantage of currently favorable tax rates, the cash keeps piling up.\n\nBerkshire is now more prepared than ever to strike when an opportunity presents itself. It could have the opportunity to buy all or some of a great company if the country faces an economic downturn, or more acute forces push specific sectors lower. In the meantime, an additional 5% return on $200 billion is a nice way to add $10 billion per year to Berkshire's pretax income.\n\nYou don't have to follow Buffett into Treasuries when you can simply buy Berkshire stock instead.\n\nWith shares trading at 18.7 times forward earnings, Berkshire Hathaway stock looks attractive. That's especially true when you take into account its huge cash position, Buffett's penchant for share repurchases, and his opinion that the present set of businesses under Berkshire have \"better prospects than exist at most large American companies.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "JPMorgan\u2019s Kolanovic Warns S&P 500 Will Plummet 23% by Year-End",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index may be headed for another record closing high, but JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Marko Kolanovic says the benchmark will falter in coming months in the face of mounting headwinds, from a slowing economy to downward earnings revisions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe US equity guage is poised to plunge to 4,200 by year-end, a roughly 23% drop from Thursday\u2019s close around 5,483, the bank\u2019s chief market strategist and his team said Friday in a mid-year outlook. It surpassed the 5,500 mark in early trading Friday after a key measure of US inflation showed signs of cooling.\n\nKolanovic\u2019s view reiterates the call he\u2019s stuck to all year, even as other Wall Street forecasters upgraded their predictions to keep up with the surge in stocks. JPMorgan\u2019s target is the lowest among strategists tracked by Bloomberg. The average year-end projection, of 5,317, implies a roughly 3% drop.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear disconnect in the huge run-up in US equity valuations and the business cycle,\u201d the strategists wrote, adding that the S&P 500\u2019s 15% year-to-date gain isn\u2019t justified, given waning growth projections. \u201cThere is a risk that an opposite of the hopeful expectation could play out in coming quarters where growth decelerates, inflation remains firm, and long-term rates don\u2019t move sharply lower.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s strategists stand out among Wall Street\u2019s megabanks in flagging the risk of a big US stock selloff. Peers at firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have steadily ratcheted up their S&P 500 targets this year. And Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson, who last year stood alongside Kolanovic in his bearish calls, has stopped issuing such warnings.\n\nKolanovic has been wrong before, staying bullish in 2022 as the S&P 500 tumbled 19% and sticking with a bearish view in 2023 as the benchmark soared 24%. He views the optimism around stocks with skepticism now as he says key economic indicators are stalling and consumers are showing signs of distress.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Federal Reserve may deliver fewer interest-rate cuts than the market expects, further pressuring the economy and stock valuations in the second half of the year, Kolanovic said.\n\nThe S&P 500 has already notched 31 closing records this year through Thursday. A key to that has been excitement around artificial intelligence, which has spurred outsized gains for the market\u2019s largest stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nKolanovic recommends that investors diversify by boosting exposure to \u201canti-momentum\u201d defensive value plays like utilities, consumer staples, health care and dividend stocks.\n\n\u2018Underappreciated\u2019 Resiliency\n\nHe acknowledged that he \u201cunderappreciated the resiliency\u201d of megacap tech companies in terms of price momentum and earnings growth. But he warned that the degree of crowding into those stocks and the concentration of market leadership are at \u201cmulti-decade extremes.\u201d\n\nWithout the sway of the 20 largest stocks in the index, the S&P 500 would be around the 4,700 level, JPMorgan estimates. The strategists say earnings forecasts would need to be revised higher for the group\u2019s strength to continue, something they view as a \u201cchallenge.\u201d They expect Wall Street analysts will revise their estimates down after second-quarter results.\n\n\u201cWhile timing reversals and rotations is difficult, we are in the camp that hyperbolic moves in price and sentiment are more often violently corrected than not when the exuberance runs its course, and the largest institutional investors are done chasing,\u201d Kolanovic said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has experienced many struggles since its 1980 IPO. After its board fired Steve Jobs in 1985, the company spent years in the wilderness. It suspended its dividend payout in 1996, and was close to bankruptcy when it brought Jobs back in 1997.\n\nShortly after that, Apple stock began a run that made it one of the most successful stocks in history, illustrating how innovation can dramatically improve a company's fortunes.\n\nApple's stock growth since Jobs' return\n\nIf one had bought $1,000 in Apple stock when Jobs returned in February 1997 and held on until today, that position would be worth around $1.8 million. That figure assumes this hypothetical investor would have reinvested their income from the dividend, which Apple reinstated in 2012.\n\nAAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nJobs' first major move after returning was to integrate the Mac ecosystem with the broader tech world, convincing Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple and develop and support a Mac-compatible version of its popular Office software.\n\nHe also set to build an Apple ecosystem, revamping the Macintosh, launching the iMac in 1998, and following up with a new MacOS in 2001. The company gained additional traction by launching the iPod music player in 2001, and opening Apple Stores and the iTunes Store soon after.\n\nHowever, the innovation that truly transformed Apple was the iPhone, which it launched in 2007. It pioneered the modern smartphone industry, and eventually eliminated many people's need to own a PC. So successful was the iPhone that it drives the majority of Apple's revenue to this day.\n\nApple's pace of innovation slowed with the passing of Jobs in 2011. Now, it more directly competes with devices and apps using Alphabet's Android operating system and with most of its mega-tech competitors in the artificial intelligence field.\n\nNonetheless, its continued innovations have at times made it the world's largest company by market cap, and positioned it in the top three today. Thanks to products such as the iPhone and its extensive ecosystem, Apple's stock price should continue to grow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "How Nancy Pelosi's Husband Is Profiting Big-Time on Nvidia -- and Why His Strategy Could Be Smart for You Too",
        "body": "Nancy Pelosi is a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives -- the first woman to serve in that position. She's in her 37th year of representing California's 11th Congressional District. Pelosi is a successful politician, a wife, mother, and grandmother. And some might think she's a savvy investor as well based on her public disclosures of trades.\n\nHowever, a close examination of those disclosures reveals that Rep. Pelosi isn't making the shrewd investing moves. Instead, it's her husband, Paul Pelosi.\n\nMr. Pelosi is profiting big-time from his investment in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's how he's doing things differently -- and why his strategy could be smart for you too.\n\nPaul Pelosi's investing approach\n\nSince early 2023, Mr. Pelosi has invested his money eight times. Two of those transactions involved limited liability companies (LLCs) that weren't traded publicly. The other trades, though, involved public companies.\n\nPelosi invested in Apple and Palo Alto Networks twice each during the period. He invested in Microsoft and Nvidia once each. There are two common denominators with these buys. First, they all focused on technology leaders. Second, Pelosi didn't buy shares of any of these stocks. Instead, he purchased or exercised call options.\n\nCall options give an investor the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares of an underlying stock at a specific price by a specific date. Pelosi's investing approach is to buy call options with strike prices that are deep in the money (i.e., significantly below the share price at the time). He also prefers expiration dates that are well into the future.\n\nHow much has Pelosi made on Nvidia?\n\nOn Nov. 22, 2023, Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia call options with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. At the time, Nvidia's share price hovered around $500 (note that this was before the company's 10-for-1 stock split conducted on June 7, 2024.)\n\nNvidia's share price has skyrocketed nearly 160% since Pelosi bought the 50 call options and is now around $125. If he exercised those calls at the split-adjusted strike price of $12 (reflecting the company's 10-for-1 stock split) and bought 50,000 shares (50 options times 100 shares per option times 10 adjusting for the split), his investment would be worth roughly $6.25 million.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know exactly how much those call options cost Pelosi. However, we do know that had he bought Nvidia shares directly on Nov. 22, 2023, his initial investment would have been in the ballpark of $2.5 million. Since buying deep-in-the-money calls is less expensive than buying shares directly, Pelosi has made more than $3.75 million on his Nvidia trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy it's a smart strategy\n\nWhy is this a smart strategy for Pelosi and potentially a smart one for you? It lowers the risk level of investing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, buying deep-in-the-money call options is less costly than buying shares directly. As a result, you don't have to put as much money at risk. These options increase at roughly the same rate as the underlying stock, so you're well-positioned to profit as much from share price gains as if you'd bought the stock.\n\nYou do have to remember to exercise the options before the expiration date or they'll become worthless. And you can still lose money. The call options decline in value at around the same rate if the underlying stock falls. However, because you don't have as much money invested, the amount you can lose is lower than if you'd bought the stock.\n\nBuying deep-in-the-money call options of Nvidia (or any other stock, for that matter) is more complicated than simply buying the stock. Investors must first obtain approval from their brokerage to trade call options. But for some, the trouble could be worth the effort. Paul and Nancy Pelosi would almost certainly say that it is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Biden's age of 81 has been a hot-button topic among voters concerned over whether or not he can continue to run the country.\n\n\"Biden's bumbling and stumbling performance amplified concerns regarding his capacity to serve and set off a new round of panic in the Democratic Party,\" Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research, said in reaction to Thursday's debate. \"Trump won the debate and should be viewed as the clear frontrunner this morning, but his demeanor and falsehoods appeared to underscore the concerns some voters have with his fitness for office.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden faced off in a debate Thursday evening. (AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nShares of DJT have been on a bumpy ride in recent months, oscillating between highs and lows.\n\nIn May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 a verdict that sent shares down 5% the day following the conviction.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n\nShares have fallen about 44% since the company's public debut at the end of March.\n\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms, although the former president almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social account throughout the trial.\n\nIn April, an updated regulatory filing showed Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.\n\nIn May, the company reported first quarter results that revealed losses of $327 million, mostly tied to expenses related to its SPAC deal. The company disclosed as of April 29 over 621,000 different shareholders owned stock in Trump Media, noting the \"vast majority\" of these were retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% stake in DJT. At current levels of around $32 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $4.3 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $2.6 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\n\nIn late April, the stock hit a milestone that secured Trump an additional $1.2 billion in cash. Stakeholders, however, are still subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "I Want to Give Money to My Son and His Wife. How Much Can I Give Without Triggering Taxes?",
        "body": "Let's say that you're an individual who wants to give money to two people, your son and his wife. Maybe this is to help with a wedding, down payment for a home or building a family.\n\nYou can likely give away a good amount of money without incurring any taxes, but there may be some other hoops to jump through. In 2024, you can give away up to $18,000 to each recipient without needing to report it to the IRS. Then, you can give away another $13.61 million total tax-free throughout your lifetime, although you will need to report such transfers. In 2024, you could theoretically give your son and daughter-in-law up to a combined $13,646,000 tax free. If you\u2019re married, you can likely give even more. It's a little more complicated than that though, so read on to learn just how the gift tax works.\n\nConsider consulting a financial advisor who can help you build a strategy to most effectively give gifts to family.\n\nWhat Is the Gift Tax?\n\nThe gift tax is a hybrid tax on gifts and other transfers. It partially overlaps with the estate tax, which is where the \"hybrid\" part comes in.\n\nThe IRS defines a gift as \"the transfer of property by one individual to another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return.\" Basically, you trigger this tax when you give someone property or assets without receiving equivalent value in return. Equivalent value (or \"full value\") is a reasonability test. You don't have to prove your transaction to a market certainty, just that a reasonable person could see this as a fair trade.\n\nThe gift tax only applies to exchanges of ownership. Personal services don't apply, nor does letting someone borrow or access your property. For example, say you're a CPA. Doing your friend's taxes is not a transfer, nor is letting them stay at your beach house for a week, even though both have market value. You must give them ownership of actual assets.\n\nThe gift tax is most often triggered by three situations:\n\nUnilateral transfers, in which you give assets while receiving nothing in return.\n\nLow-value transfers, in which you give assets while receiving less than full value in return.\n\nLow- or no-interest loans, in which you give a loan and charge significantly less than market interest.\n\nLawyers use the 19th century example of a \"peppercorn promise\" to illustrate low-value transfers. Say your friend offers to sell you their car in exchange for a peppercorn. This would be a gift dressed up as a sale because, even though you are technically exchanging assets, the value of the car dramatically exceeds 1/16 teaspoon of spices. The taxable value of this gift would be the difference in value between the car and the peppercorn.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, the IRS exempts several categories of transfers from the gift tax. For example, direct tuition and medical payments typically do not count as taxable gifts regardless of the amount.\n\nFor help navigating the complications of gift tax laws, consider consulting with a fiduciary financial advisor.\n\nGift Tax Exclusions and Rates\n\nLike the estate tax, few households will ever pay the gift tax. This is due to high annual and lifetime exclusions, which are amounts that you can give away without triggering gift taxes.\n\nAnnual Exclusions\n\nThe annual exclusion is the amount you can give away each year without reporting it to the IRS. The annual exclusion operates on a per-donor, per-recipient basis. This means that you can give away up to the annual exclusion to an unlimited number of people each year without reporting it. In 2024, the annual exclusion is $18,000, and the IRS generally adjusts it each year for inflation.\n\nThe annual exclusion renews each year, meaning that the amount you can give tax-free in a given year has no relationship with gifts you have made in previous years.\n\nFor example, in 2024, you could give $18,000 to your son and another $18,000 to your daughter-in-law without reporting these transfers to the IRS or paying taxes. Then, in 2025, you can do so again.\n\nThe annual exclusion has no relationship with the estate tax.\n\nLifetime Exclusions\n\nOnce you exceed the annual exclusion to a given recipient, you must report any additional gifts to the IRS using Form 709. This form is filed with your annual taxes, not at the time you make the gift.\n\nGifts in excess of the annual exclusion apply to your lifetime exclusion. This is the amount that you can transfer tax-free over your entire life, in both gifts and estate. It applies cumulatively to you, personally, regardless of recipients. In 2024 the lifetime exclusion is $13.61 million.\n\nThe lifetime exclusion does not renew annually. While the IRS does raise the cap each year to account for inflation, each transfer you make reduces your lifetime exclusion permanently.\n\nFor example, say that you give $22,000 to your son and $25,000 to his wife. Together, this is a combined $11,000 in gifts above the annual exclusions ($4,000 to your son and $7,000 to your wife). You would report that $11,000 in gifts on Form 709 to the IRS and your lifetime exclusion would be reduced by $11,000, potentially from $13.61 million to $13,599,00. That reduction will not go away, even if the IRS raises the exclusion for inflation.\n\nThe lifetime exclusion is a shared exclusion for gifts and estates. During your lifetime, you can make any amount of gifts tax-free to the amount you have remaining in your lifetime exclusion. Then, in your estate, you can pass assets to your heirs tax-free again to the amount you have remaining in your lifetime exclusion.\n\nGift Tax Rates Above the Exclusion Amounts\n\nIf you make a gift that exceeds both your annual exclusion to that individual and your remaining lifetime exclusion, you will owe taxes on the remainder. Gifts and estates are taxed at between 18% and 40% depending on the amount in question.\n\nFor example, say that in 2024 you have $110,000 left on your lifetime exclusion. This means that, over the course of your life, you have given away $13.5 million above each year's annual exclusion to various individuals and organizations. You now want to give $100,000 each to your son and daughter in law. Your taxes would work like this:\n\nSon Annual Exclusion: $100,000 \u2013 $18,000 = $82,000\n\nDaughter-in-law Annual Exclusion: $100,000 \u2013 $18,000 = $82,000\n\n2024 Reportable Gifts: $82,000 * 2 = $164,000\n\nLifetime Exclusion: $110,000 \u2013 $164,000 = -$54,000\n\nTaxable Gift: $54,000\n\nYou do not report gifts up to the annual exclusion for each recipient ($18,000 in 2024). Then you can reduce any reportable gifts by the amount left in your lifetime exclusion. Since your reportable gift exceeds your lifetime exclusion, you will owe taxes on the remaining $54,000.\n\nOnly the giver must report and pay the gift tax. Gifts are generally not considered taxable income, and the recipient does not have to pay gift taxes.\n\nA financial advisor can help you build an appropriate gifting and estate plan. Talk to a financial advisor today.\n\nHow Much Can You Give Away?\n\nSo, all of this said, how much can you give away to your son and his wife? The answer depends in part on how much giving you've made during your life to this point. If you have made past gifts above your annual exclusion for a recipient, then your lifetime exclusion will be reduced by that amount. However, assuming that you still have your full lifetime exclusion, the most you can give your son and daughter-in-law tax free, assuming you are single, is:\n\nSon Annual Exclusion: $18,000\n\nDaughter-in-law Annual Exclusion: $18,000\n\nLifetime Exclusion: $13.61 million\n\nTotal 2024 Giving: $13,646,000\n\nYou can give them the total value of your annual exclusion per person, plus the total lifetime exclusion, for a total tax-free gift of $13,646,000. Although note that, if you do so, you will use up your entire lifetime exclusion. Future transfers through gifts and your estate may be taxed.\n\nDouble Your Gift With Gift Splitting\n\nFinally, there is gift-splitting. This refers to the fact that each member of a married couple receives their own annual and lifetime exclusions, even if they file taxes jointly. So, say that you're married. You can give your son and his wife up to $18,000 each in 2024 under the annual exclusion. Your spouse could also give your son and his wife up to $18,000 each under her own annual exclusion, for a combined gift of $72,000 from one household to the other.\n\nIf you gift-split you must file form 709. This lets you tell the IRS how you have distributed the gift among the members of your household. For example, say that you give your son $30,000. You would need to file a form 709 so that you and your spouse can each claim $15,000 toward your annual exclusion.\n\nGift-splitting also applies to lifetime exclusions. If you are married, in 2024, your household has $13.61 million per spouse to transfer tax-free for combined maximum giving of $27.22 million. Once you exceed your annual exclusion, you can then distribute gifts between your and your spouse's lifetime exclusions. So, if you are married and would like to give money to your son and his wife, you could theoretically give them up to $27,292,000 in 2024 tax-free.\n\nGift splitting can get complicated. Consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you navigate the rules.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGift taxes apply to any unilateral transfer or any exchange when you give assets for less than their full value. Each year the IRS allows you to give an amount tax-free to any number of recipients, and over your lifetime you can give away more than $13 million without paying any taxes on it either.\n\nMore Resources\n\nThe gifts and estate tax is a hybrid tax on unilateral transfers, as we discussed above. However, just like the gift tax, the estate tax has its own rules that only apply to post-mortem transfers. Here's what you need to know.\n\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn\u2019t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Alessandro Biascioli\n\nThe post I Want to Give Money to My Son and His Wife.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 149% This Year. Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Outperform It the Rest of 2024.",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to own in the artificial intelligence (AI) race so far. The company's revenue has tripled year over year in recent quarters, sending the stock up 149% in the first half of 2024.\n\nAt these lofty share prices, Nvidia's valuation looks stretched. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio was less than 30 to start the year, but it now trades at a more expensive 45 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. Nvidia might experience enough growth to push the stock higher, but there's also a chance that near-term demand is already baked into the share price, which could limit the stock's gains through the end of the year.\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia isn't the only AI stock beating the market. Nvidia has benefited from tight supply of AI chips, but as supply improves, it could drive more demand for AI servers, and the stocks of these companies trade at more reasonable valuations, which could set up superior returns in the near term.\n\nHere are two AI server stocks that could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in 2024, up 188%. It sells rack-mount systems for data centers. Because of its exposure to the broader demand for AI chips, Supermicro (as it is also known) is a solid alternative to Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro sells into several markets, including 5G connectivity and edge computing. But demand for its plug-and-play rack systems that feature data center chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are key drivers of its growth right now. Revenue surged 200% year over year last quarter, which mirrors Nvidia's growth.\n\nSelling server systems is a competitive market, but it's encouraging to see Supermicro growing faster than the industry. It maintains close relationships with suppliers like Nvidia, which helps the company deliver innovative solutions before competitors. It's currently pushing the adoption of direct liquid cooling solutions, which it has developed for years, to better manage the heat generated from AI computing systems.\n\nIf it continues to outpace the rest of the server industry, the stock could have substantial upside. Wall Street analysts expect Supermicro's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 46% over the next several years -- higher than the 33% estimate for Nvidia.\n\nMoreover, Supermicro stock also offers better value than Nvidia. Its current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 35 -- lower than the 45 forward P/E multiple for Nvidia. Investors are getting more earnings growth for a lower price with Supermicro -- a recipe for superior returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) shares are up 80% year to date, but the company's shares could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year due to accelerating demand for the company's AI servers.\n\nDell generates most of its revenue from client solutions, which include sales of PCs, but infrastructure solutions is its fastest-growing business, with revenue up 22% year over year last quarter. AI server shipments more than doubled over the year-ago period. Over the last year, revenue from AI servers exploded from zero to $1.7 billion, and it's just getting started.\n\nSales of AI servers are weighing on Dell's gross margin, but the robust revenue growth expected in the AI server business could support substantial earnings growth to send the stock higher over the next few years.\n\nThe company's AI server backlog grew approximately 31% in the last quarter to $3.8 billion. That increase might reflect new business from Tesla, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. Dell seems to be in a strong competitive position, as the analyst believes that Dell won a larger amount of server business with the electric vehicle maker than Supermicro.\n\nWall Street analysts project earnings to grow 12% annually over the next several years, and those estimates might increase further once Dell's PC business recovers. The stock's forward P/E of 18 looks attractive against the potential for accelerating earnings growth and could provide superior returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Nike (NKE) stock fell nearly 20% on Friday after the retailer said it expects revenue to decline more than it previously thought in the coming year.\n\nThe company said Thursday it expects revenue to fall mid-single digits in 2025, including an expected 10% decline in the first quarter. Nike had initially guided for overall sales growth in 2025.\n\nFriday marked the worst single-day decline in Nike stock's history.\n\nThe guidance reflects a continuing trend from Nike's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which the shoemaker reported after the closing bell on Thursday. The company said quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61 billion, below Wall Street's estimates for $12.86 billion. Meanwhile, Nike's $0.99 earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations of $0.66. Nike's direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $5.1 billion.\n\n\"Fiscal [2025] will be a transition year for our business,\" Nike CEO John Donahoe said during the company's earnings call.\n\nThe company has been trying to reignite sales growth in what has been a lackluster year for the stock so far. Morningstar equity analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance the sales number was \"pretty weak\" and was the main concern from the release.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton downgraded Nike to Equalweight from Overweight following the earnings call, noting Nike stock has been \"put in the penalty box\" for the near-term. Straton cut her price target to $79 from $114.\n\n\"While undergoing strategic change, recent performance has been riddled with quarterly\n\nmisses & guidance cuts,\" Straton wrote in a note to clients. \"NKE\u2019s long-term growth & profitability trajectory is subsequently both unclear & lower than our prior assumption.\"\n\nThe company's stock had already entered the release down more than 17% over the last year, a far cry from the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 26% gain, as investors grew wary of slowing growth at the retailer.\n\n\"We doubt many investors will view this as a 'buy the pullback' event, and we think NKE shares are headed for a stay in the proverbial penalty box until new product innovations actually start to manifest themselves and management regains investor trust,\" Wedbush senior vice president of equity research Tom Nikic wrote in a note following the earnings call.\n\nWall Street has been closely watching Nike's product pipeline as the Oregon-based company works to fend off competition in its core athletic footwear market from rivals like Adidas (ADDYY) and relative upstarts like On (ONON) and Deckers' (DECK) Hoka brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nNike executives stressed they believe their plans to scale new products are on \"track\" and will impact the company's financials by the end of the year.\n\n\"We are planning for meaningful, sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half, and it starts with the confidence that we have around the new products that we're bringing to market,\" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the earnings call.\n\nWill innovation boost Nike's stock?

        "title": "I'm 65 With $1.2 Million in an IRA. Is It Too Late to Convert to a Roth if I'm Already Taking Social Security?",
        "body": "A 65-year-old woman examines whether it makes sense to convert her $1.2 million IRA into a Roth IRA.\n\nImagine you\u2019re 65 with $1.2 million in an IRA and a lingering question: should you convert your account into a Roth IRA? The answer may depend on how you go about it. A Roth conversion can provide some sizable advantages, including tax-free withdrawals and freedom from mandated distributions \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always the right move.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no prohibition or disadvantage to a Roth conversion based on your age at 65, converting the entire $1.2 million all at once will burden you with a larger tax bill than you may want to pay in a single year. If you use partial Roth conversions tailored to your situation, however, you can significantly reduce your tax burden and also provide for a tax-free inheritance later. If you need additional guidance surrounding Roth conversions and other retirement planning topics, speak with a financial advisor today.\n\nRoth IRA Conversion Concepts\n\nA Roth conversion shifts retirement money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Traditional pre-tax IRAs let you deduct contributions from taxable income when you contribute, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed according to your income tax bracket that year.\n\nRoth IRA contributions use after-tax dollars, so you don\u2019t get a tax break when you make contributions. Qualified withdrawals can be made tax-free later, though. Another big plus is that Roth accounts are not subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs), which can bump you into a higher tax bracket in retirement. Without RMDs, Roth funds can stay invested and grow tax-free forever, being passed down to your heirs if that\u2019s part of your estate plan. There\u2019s also no income limit on Roth conversions, unlike direct contributions to a Roth IRA that can only be made by individuals with less than $161,000 in modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) and married couples filing jointly with MAGI less than $240,000.\n\nBut Roth conversions carry a significant catch. The money you convert in a given year becomes ordinary income in the year in which it\u2019s converted. That means paying taxes on that money \u2013 lots of them potentially. Turning $1.2 million into taxable Roth conversion income could trigger the 37% top federal rate, plus state taxes in most states. One alternative approach for reducing this potential tax hit is to do partial conversions, spreading a large amount over several years to avoid bumping you into a higher bracket.\n\nAnd if you want to talk through your options with an expert, consider using this free matching tool to find a financial advisor.\n\nLump Sum vs. Incremental Conversions\n\nA Roth conversion can provide tax flexibility in retirement. However, it may not make sense for everyone.\n\nAs a single 65-year-old with $1.2 million in a traditional IRA, let\u2019s assume you collect $24,000 in annual Social Security income, which is slightly more than the most recent average retirement benefit of $1,856 per month. If you converted the full $1.2 million IRA balance to a Roth IRA in 2023 and took the standard deduction ($15,700 in 2023 for people 65 and older), all or nearly all of the converted amount could be subject to the top tax rate of 37%. This could result in a one-time tax federal income bill of over $398,000 due in April 2024, plus more if state taxes apply.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeed help with a Roth conversion? Find a financial advisor today.\n\nThere may be a better way, though. Spreading the $1.2 million conversion over 10 years at $120,000 per year puts you in the 22% tax bracket in tax year 2023 after taking the standard deduction. That means paying approximately $18,430 in federal taxes annually on the portion that gets converted. Over the decade, that totals around $184,300 for a total tax savings of roughly $214,000. (While tax brackets change from year to year, we\u2019re assuming you\u2019ll remain in the 24% bracket for simplicity\u2019s sake.)\n\nPeople under 59.5 years old should be mindful of the five-year rule when doing a Roth conversion. Withdrawing money from a Roth account less than five years after a conversion may trigger a 10% penalty. However, that rule doesn't apply to people who are 59.5 or older, as well as others who qualify for certain exceptions.\n\nMore Roth Conversion Considerations\n\nThere are some other factors to keep in mind. For one, adding taxable income from a Roth conversion may increase taxes on your Social Security benefits. You may also have to pay higher Medicare premiums and lose access to some tax credits.\n\nAlso, the money you leave in the Roth while doing partial conversions will likely continue to grow, so you\u2019ll have to convert more than $120,000 in later years to empty the account. Furthermore, future tax rates may increase. These uncertainties mean that any projections of taxes owed on the gradual conversion plan may vary significantly from the actual amounts you\u2019ll owe. Converting everything now provides certainty \u2013 you\u2019ll know exactly how much you have to pay.\n\nDeciding If a Roth Conversion Is Right\n\nA 65-year-old couple looks over their retirement savings and weighs whether a Roth conversion is worth it.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts when evaluating a large Roth conversion. You may want to follow this process and speak with a financial advisor to get a better understanding of how this maneuver will affect your outlook:\n\nDetermine how you want to handle IRA money at your death. If the objective is completely tax-free inheritance, calculated partial Roth conversions can maintain that tax-free growth for heirs over time.\n\nCompare current and future expected tax rates. Paying taxes now on a lump sum conversion or a series of larger conversions may ultimately save you if tax rates increase in the future.\n\nConsider other elements of your financial plan. Examine your income streams, multi-year tax outlook, healthcare costs and estate plan. To pick the Roth conversion method that fits you best will likely require a careful and comprehensive analysis of your financial outlook.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile you can do a Roth conversion at any age, converting an entire $1.2 million IRA into a Roth account all at once will typically saddle you with a large tax bill. However, partial Roth conversions tailored specifically for you can help considerably. Check retirement spending plans, estate planning, health budgets and more before opting for a conversion. Also, consider potential changes to tax rates in the future and how they could impact you.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nA financial advisor can help you evaluate whether a Roth IRA conversion makes sense for you. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now, get started now.\n\nSmartAsset\u2019s Social Security calculator is a quick and easy way to project the size of your monthly check after you claim your benefits. If you\u2019re considering relocating to a new state for retirement, it\u2019s important to assess the tax environment of that state. SmartAsset\u2019s retirement tax friendliness tool can help you do that.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/designer491, \u00a9iStock.com/Pekic, \u00a9iStock.com/insta_photos\n\nThe post I\u2019m 65 Years Old With $1.2 Million in an IRA.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 75%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "A resurgence in the popularity of stock splits has been front and center in 2024 as a number of high-profile stocks have taken the plunge. Companies will typically go down this path after years or even decades of robust operating and financial results have pushed the stock price out of reach of some investors. While a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying value of the business, it does make shares more affordable for employees and everyday investors, a reason that is often given by companies as the principal motivation for the split.\n\nInvestors, however, should focus on the robust results that ultimately led to the stock split, as this is historically an indicator of a business that is firing on all cylinders, which is a brilliant reason to own the stock.\n\nLet's take a look at two companies that still have significant upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 59%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with mounds of upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was already the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and in data centers. However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) early last year kicked its business into overdrive.\n\nThe company is referred to as a \"picks-and-shovels play.\" The investing reference has its origins in a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\" For the AI gold rush, Nvidia is supplying the picks and shovels.\n\nThe parallel-processing capability of Nvidia's GPUs was groundbreaking for rendering lifelike images in video games. It allows them to run a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It turns out this same functionality works equally well at processing AI.\n\nNvidia's recent results show why most analysts on Wall Street are upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes the processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest money maker, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.\n\nNvidia recently completed its high-profile, 10-for-1 stock split, and despite posting gains of more than 194% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains remarkably bullish. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann boosted his price target to $200 while reiterating a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 59% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerating demand for AI-centric processors forms the foundation of the analyst's thesis, but he believes the secret sauce is Nvidia's proprietary software that's coupled with its best-in-class chips.\n\n\"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. The analyst's price target suggests Nvidia's market will soar to nearly $5 trillion over the next year.\n\nDespite the stock's epic run over the past year, Wall Street is still remarkably bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Implied upside of 75%\n\nAnother stock-split stock with significant upside potential is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The company's focus on health-centric energy drinks has been a hit with consumers. It's the third-largest energy drink brand and the fastest-growing, contributing 47% of all industry growth in the first quarter, outpacing larger rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage.\n\nCelsius holds an enviable position in an industry that continues to grow. The energy drink category has continued to generate robust growth over the past three years, even as the broader beverage category has contracted -- and Celsius is leading the charge.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS surged 108%. It's always encouraging when profits are growing faster than revenue, as this illustrates that a company has reached the scale necessary to drop more income to the bottom line.\n\nThe company's sales more than doubled last year as it leaned into its partnership with PepsiCo, which resulted in the beverage and snacks giant making a $550 million investment in Celsius, taking an 8.5% stake in the company and inking a long-term distribution agreement. This is a double-edged sword, however, as Celsius now faces tough comps after such a banner year.\n\nCelsius Holdings conducted its 3-for-1 stock split late last year, thanks to its track record of robust performance. However, fears regarding slowing growth have punished the stock, which has shed 42% over the past month, but some on Wall Street are undaunted. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala has a $98 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 75% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst noted the drawdown is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and advises investors to ignore the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Celsius. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 14 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Palantir's Untapped Potential: Decoding the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock's Long-Term Value for Strategic Investors",
        "body": "Companies today generate mountains of data. That data can be of great value -- but only if it's correctly harnessed, visualized, and used to improve decision-making. Often, though, that data lives in a variety of different software systems, with various chunks siloed away in platforms that can't communicate with each other, complicating any effort to see the full picture. For instance, a corporation may have a customer services database, enterprise management software, a marketing platform, and more. Unifying the data from all of these platforms into one system and mining the integrated result for actionable insights is Palantir's (NYSE: PLTR) specialty, and why its services are in demand.\n\nThe Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is its latest innovation, and it's loaded with potential.\n\nClients are flocking to Palantir AIP\n\nImagine a wholesale supplier facing a severe weather event affecting one of its centers. Management needs to know the most efficient alternative methods for keeping its customers supplied, and what effect its choices will have on margins. Or perhaps you manage planning a company's inventory levels, and you need to know what impact a price increase or decrease will have on demand. Or you want to automate your payment processing to suppliers by unifying documents like purchase orders, invoices, and warehouse receipts. These are all use cases for Palantir's AIP.\n\nAIP uses large language models that enable its clients to ask questions like those in plain English and receive actionable responses. Selling a platform this complex is difficult. Examining use cases for other companies is helpful, but it is still difficult to visualize how a platform like AIP will work in a specific company. Because of this, Palantir conducts \"boot camps\" where potential customers build use cases unique to their businesses in just days. These have proven a terrific tool to increase Palantir's client base -- its U.S. commercial customer count is exploding.\n\nSource: Palantir.\n\nIn the first quarter, that translated to a 40% year-over-year increase in U.S. commercial sales to $150 million and 27% worldwide commercial sales growth to $299 million. Government revenue grew by a slower 16% to $335 million. Penetrating the commercial market will be critical to Palantir's long-term success.\n\nTotal sales in Q1 rose 21% year over year to $634 million, and Palantir increased its profitability. But not everyone is convinced.\n\nExamining the Palantir bear case\n\nPalantir enjoys a large following among retail investors, and has inspired spirited debates between its bulls and bears over the last several years. The company is methodically putting many of the bear arguments to bed. I'll take you through two of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, many lamented the company's persistent unprofitability. This was legitimate criticism as the company racked up annual losses until 2023, when it achieved profitability. Palantir has posted net profits in the last six quarters and dramatically increased operating profits.\n\nPLTR Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSecond, Palantir bears pointed out the company's extensive use of stock-based compensation to reward employees. The most significant portion of such distributions usually goes to the top executives. The result of issuing a large number of new shares to pay your team, however, is that the number of outstanding shares increases and shareholders' portions of the pie decrease. However, Palantir has been dialing back its stock-based compensation as its revenue has been ramping up.\n\nPLTR Stock Based Compensation (TTM) Chart\n\nUsing stock-based compensation also helps companies preserve their cash. Palantir finished Q1 with $3.9 billion in cash and investments on its books and no long-term debt.\n\nIs Palantir stock a buy?\n\nAnother reason some investors remain in the Palantir bear camp is its high valuation. The stock trades at nearly 25 times current sales. That's a lower price-to-sales ratio than CrowdStrike and a higher one than Snowflake -- both of which, like Palantir, are high-growth software companies with market caps below $100 billion.\n\nPLTR PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock is also trading at a higher valuation than its historical average. However, Palantir is the most profitable of these three tech companies. Over its last four reported quarters, Palantir produced nearly $200 million in operating profits, compared to $24 million for CrowdStrike and a loss of $1.2 billion for Snowflake.\n\nInvestors can afford to be patient if they choose to buy Palantir stock. The best strategy would be to build your stake in it gradually and regularly over time so you can take advantage of any dips in the price that might occur. A dollar-cost averaging strategy can reduce short-term risk when investing in high-priced stocks.\n\nPalantir has entrenched itself as a leader in data and artificial intelligence management. Although its valuation is high, its profits are growing and it's in a strong financial position to excel over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "How to Earn $500 Per Month From Caterpillar In Dividends Following The Latest Dividend Increase\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWith three decades of consistent dividend increases and a roughly 40% gain in stock price over the past year, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the most notable dividend stocks in the market. Analysts believe Caterpillar is a defensive play for long-term investors as the company is positioned well to benefit from the expected increase in infrastructure spending in the U.S. and the global economic boom. Caterpillar's business is diversified across construction equipment, power generation, energy and transportation, with increasing exposure to electrification, digital solutions and alternative fuels.\n\nCaterpillar stock has a new growth catalyst: backup power generators for data centers. As tech companies establish data centers worldwide to power their generative AI apps, they need data centers with uninterrupted power access. Caterpillar's reciprocating engines for data centers are already seeing a rise in demand. During the first-quarter earnings call, Caterpillar's management said the company plans a \"multiyear capital investment\" in its reciprocating engine division to double its output for large engines and aftermarket parts compared with last year.\n\nCaterpillar's P/E ratio is around 15 as of June 25, which is low compared to the industry average of 18. While Caterpillar's growth is facing headwinds amid a decline in construction activity in residential markets in the US and Europe, analysts believe the company is set to see a rebound in growth following the beginning of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Wall Street expects Caterpillar's earnings to grow 5% next year and 7% per annum on average for the next five years. However, these growth estimates can increase amid Caterpillar's expansion into new business segments such as AI, data analytics and alternative fuels.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nIn addition to these growth catalysts, Caterpillar's shareholder returns are also increasing. During the first quarter, the company allocated $5.1 billion for share repurchases and dividends. Over the past five years, the company's dividend has grown at a CAGR of 8.6%. The stock's payout ratio is 25%, which means the company allocates a substantial amount of cash to future growth.\n\nIn this backdrop, it'd be interesting to know how you can earn $500 monthly in dividends from Caterpillar. Let's find out.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Earn $500 a Month From Caterpillar Following the Latest Dividend Hike\n\nBefore we begin, it's important to note that since Caterpillar increased its quarterly dividend to $1.41 per share from $1.30 on June 12, we'd be using the latest dividend for our calculations. However, please keep in mind that the new dividend is payable on August 20 to shareholders of record on July 22.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the number of Caterpillar shares you need to buy to reach your income goal. An income of $500 per month means you will generate $6,000 per year in dividends from Caterpillar. Assuming a dividend of $1.41 per share (new dividend after the latest increase, effective August 20), Caterpillar's annual dividend comes out to be $5.64 ($1.41 x 4 = $5.64).\n\nNumber of shares needed = $6,000 / $5.64 = 1,063.829\n\nTo earn $500 a month from Caterpillar, you need to buy about 1,064 shares of the company.\n\nTotal Investment Needed to Earn $500 a Month from Caterpillar Dividends\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the investment you need to make in Caterpillar to reach the $500/month dividend goal. We will multiply the total number of shares by the stock\u2019s latest price. CAT closed at $330 on June 24.\n\nTotal Investment Needed to Earn $500/month from Caterpillar in Dividends = $330 x 1,064 = $351,120\n\nTo earn $500 monthly in dividends from Caterpillar, you\u2019d need to invest about $351,120 in the company.\n\nEquityMultiple Ascent Income Fund:\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "2 Cheap Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 175% and 495%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "body": "The S&P 500 has advanced 15% year to date and 42% since the beginning of 2023. Those gains have made it difficult to find bargains in the stock market, but certain Wall Street analysts see plenty of upside in UiPath (NYSE: PATH) and Block (NYSE: SQ).\n\nKeith Weiss at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case scenario that puts UiPath at $35 per share by May 2025. That forecast implies 175% upside from its current price of $12.69 per share.\n\nMaximilian Friedrich at Ark Invest published a valuation model nearly four years ago that puts Block at $375 per share by December 2025. That forecast implies 495% upside from its current price of $63 per share.\n\nSpoiler alert: Both price targets appear overly ambitious, but UiPath and Block still warrant consideration. Here's what investors should know.\n\n1. UiPath\n\nUiPath is the market leader in robotic process automation (RPA). Its platform helps businesses discover opportunities for automation with process mining and task mining tools. It also helps businesses build and manage software robots to automate those processes and tasks. Additionally, UiPath extends its RPA functionality with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities like computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\nFor example, UiPath's Document Understanding product can extract, interpret, and take action on information from documents. Its Communication Mining product brings the same features to conversational channels like email and chat, which lets businesses automate certain customer interactions. Forrester Research recently recognized UiPath as a leader in document mining and analytics, and the IDC recognized its leadership in intelligent document processing software.\n\nUiPath reported reasonably good financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30). Revenue increased 16% to $335 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 18% to $0.13 per diluted share. But management provided discouraging context that that caused the stock to tumble 35% following the report.\n\nSpecifically, management said deals slowed toward the end of the quarter due to macroeconomic challenges and inconsistent sales execution. Those headwinds are evident in guidance, which calls for revenue growth of just 5% in the second quarter. Founder Daniel Dines has reassumed the role of CEO to steer the company through the challenging period ahead.\n\nOn the bright side, UiPath is the market leader in RPA software, a market projected to grow at 40% annually through 2030. The company is also leaning into demand for generative AI with Autopilot, a conversational assistant that automates various tasks. For instance, Autopilot can streamline the development and testing of automations. Some Autopilot features became generally available in June 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects the company to grow sales at 14% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends January 2028). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 5.3 times sales look quite reasonable. However, shareholders probably won't see triple-digit returns in the next year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's bull-case price target is contingent upon a discounted cash flow model that assumes revenue will grow at 18% annually over the next decade. That is unlikely at this point. However, Morgan Stanley's base-case target of $15 per share still implies that the stock is cheap right now.\n\n2. Block\n\nBlock is a fintech company that breaks its business into the Square and Cash App ecosystems. Square simplifies commerce for merchants with a cohesive set of hardware, software, and banking services. That integrated product strategy differentiates Block from traditional merchant services providers, which generally equip small businesses with disjointed payment processing solutions. Block aims to grow the Square ecosystem by engaging larger sellers and expanding internationally.\n\nSimilarly, Cash App simplifies consumer finance by integrating a broad range of services on a single platform, including the ability to save, spend, borrow, and invest money. Despite competition from PayPal and Venmo, that value proposition is resonating with the market. Cash App was the ninth-most downloaded mobile application in the U.S. last year, and the most downloaded digital wallet. Block is particularly focused on driving direct deposit adoption and boosting cash inflows.\n\nBlock reported solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Square gross profit rose 19% to $820 million and Cash App gross profit rose 25% to $1.2 billion, such that total gross profit increased 22% to $2 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped 98% to $0.85 per diluted share.\n\nBlock made progress expanding the Square ecosystem upmarket and internationally during the quarter. Mid-market sellers, defined as generating $500,000 in annualized gross payment volume (GPV), accounted for 39% of Square GPV, up from 38% in the prior year. International sellers accounted for 13% of Square gross profit, up from 11% in the prior year.\n\nBlock also made progress in driving Cash App inflows. Monthly transacting users increased 6% to 57 million and inflows per monthly transacting user increased 11% to $1,255. Management also noted strong momentum with a variety of products, including Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, BNPL (buy now, pay later), and Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, Block has a reasonably strong economic moat in its ability to simplify commerce and consumer finance, and the company is making progress on its strategic growth initiatives. Block has almost no chance of returning 495% by 2025, but patient investors should still consider buying a small position. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings per share to grow at 40% annually through 2026. That makes its current valuation of 28 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Surges 28%, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the technology sector right now, and one company that stands to benefit greatly is e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Roughly halfway into 2024, shares of Amazon have soared by 23% -- handily topping the 15% year-to-date gain of the S&P 500 and the 19% rise of the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nYet even in the wake of this strong performance, Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan Chase thinks Amazon stock could rocket by another 28% over the next 12 months.\n\nAmazon's cash-flow empire\n\nTwo of the most closely followed institutional investors are Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.\n\nAdmittedly, Wood and Buffett don't have a lot in common when it comes to their investment styles. Buffett's portfolio is dominated by blue chip businesses with consistent cash flows. By contrast, Wood often takes positions in companies that operate in emerging technologies such as genomics, space exploration, and different aspects of the tech realm.\n\nOne stock that they both own, though, is Amazon. While those positions are relatively small compared to their other holdings, I'm intrigued that these two have any overlap across their respective portfolios.\n\nOne of the reasons that I think both Buffett and Wood own Amazon has to do with its cash flow. Many growth companies (especially in technology) burn cash for long periods in pursuit of accelerated revenue growth.\n\nAmazon, however, now generates a staggering level of profit. For the 12-month period that ended March 31, the company increased its operating cash flow by 82% year over year to $99 billion. Moreover, Amazon's free cash flow over that duration was a whopping $50 billion.\n\nWhile it's the company's robust free cash flow that likely attracts an investor like Buffett, it's how management is investing these excess profits that I think piques the interest of Wood.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThese AI investments should not be overlooked\n\nLike many of its big tech peers, Amazon has been aggressively pursuing all things AI over the last year or so.\n\nThe first major move the company made on that front was a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, a competitor to OpenAI. In addition, Amazon is an investor in machine-learning start-up Hugging Face. Moreover, back in April, the company announced an $11 billion infrastructure project to build out data centers in Indiana.\n\nI see all of these moves as pieces of a larger puzzle. Namely, all of these assets should play important roles as the company begins rolling out additional AI features across its ecosystem. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform stands to benefit greatly from these AI investments, as do its legacy e-commerce business and fast-growing advertising operation.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest in Amazon stock right now?\n\nWhile Anmuth's price target of $240 might tempt you to buy Amazon stock, I wouldn't get too hung up on particulars.\n\nInstead, investing in Amazon should be rooted more in a strong conviction that AI represents a new frontier for the technology sector at large. Moreover, allocating a position of your portfolio to Amazon would suggest that you're optimistic the company can emerge as a leader in the AI landscape.\n\nAs I've expressed in previous articles, given Amazon's diverse set of businesses and its ability to leverage AI across its ecosystem, I think the company is going to dominate for years to come.\n\nAMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nIf you look at the chart above, you'll notice something interesting about Amazon's price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple. Namely, the metric surged to excessive levels and then disappeared during 2022 and part of 2023. That is because Amazon was burning cash during this period, thereby rendering P/FCF meaningless.\n\nHowever, as the company currently generates consistent cash flow, the multiple has started to normalize. What I find most intriguing about the trend above is that the company's P/FCF multiple of 43 is about half its 10-year average.\n\nThis is hard to believe. Amazon is a much different, larger, and more sophisticated business today than it was a decade ago. However, the valuation trends above would imply that Amazon stock is more reasonably valued today at its current price.\n\nConsidering the long-term tailwinds AI represents, as well as the company's numerous investments in the space and the impacts these could have on its future prospects, I think buying Amazon stock right now is a no-brainer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent S&P 500 Dividend Stocks Down 20% or More to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "body": "The S&P 500 is near its all-time high, but not all stocks are doing so well. That's especially the case in the real estate sector, where some of the highest-quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are trading for 20% or more below their all-time highs.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three excellent REITs, all of which are S&P 500 components, that are worth a closer look while they're on sale.\n\nBuilt for steady income no matter what\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the largest and most popular REITs in the market, with a massive portfolio of properties and reliable monthly dividend income. In fact, Realty Income has a trademark on the phrase \"The Monthly Dividend Company.\" And now, this top-notch stock is down by 35% from its peak.\n\nRealty Income has over 15,400 properties in the U.S. and Europe, and about 80% of the portfolio is retail in nature. But the company acquires properties occupied by tenants that are in recession-resistant and e-commerce-resistant forms of retail. Think dollar stores, drug stores, warehouse clubs, and other properties that tend to hold up well in tough economies. Tenants sign long-term (10-plus-year) leases with annual rent increases built in. All Realty Income has to do is get a quality tenant in place and enjoy year after year of reliably growing income.\n\nTo be clear, the decline in Realty Income is mainly due to the current interest rate climate, as opposed to anything wrong with Realty Income's business. The company's income stream continues to grow predictably, and the dividend has now been raised for 107 consecutive quarters with a 5.9% current yield.\n\nThe world's largest REIT is on sale\n\nPrologis (NYSE: PLD) isn't just the largest industrial REIT in the market, it is the largest real estate investment trust of any kind. And now you can buy shares for more than 35% below its 2022 all-time high.\n\nThe company owns logistics real estate, such as distribution centers and warehouses. If you've ever seen one of those massive Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) distribution centers, there's a decent chance it's a Prologis-owned property. In all, Prologis owns 1.2 billion square feet of rentable space on four continents.\n\nPrologis has fallen recently, and one big reason is oversupply fears in the industrial space, but this should be a temporary headwind if anything. While industrial demand is strong, new inventory is expected to drop considerably in 2024 and 2025, and this should help balance the market.\n\nIn the meantime, Prologis has been a massive beneficiary of embedded rent growth. In a nutshell, industrial property rental rates soared during the pandemic, but because tenants are on long-term leases, the company only benefits as its leases renew. We're still seeing the effects of this -- in the most recent quarter, Prologis' leasing spread on both new and renewal leases was a staggering 69.5% (so, if a tenant was paying $10,000 per month, he or she would be paying $16,950 on average after renewing). This is likely to be a long-tailed trend, and Prologis' income growth could be surprisingly strong for the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn industry leader with tons of potential\n\nVici Properties (NYSE: VICI) is by far the youngest REIT of the three, and it has held up better than the other two in the rising-rate environment, with its stock down by just 21% from the highs.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, think of Vici as the leading owner of gaming real estate. It owns the real estate of some of the most valuable Las Vegas Strip properties, including The Venetian, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and more. It also owns many regional properties, including top-tier properties like The Borgata in Atlantic City and MGM National Harbor in DC.\n\nNot only is Vici likely to benefit from the tailwinds provided by the legalized gaming trend in the United States, which should create acquisition opportunities over the coming years, but the company is just starting to branch out into non-gaming real estate. It recently acquired a portfolio of Bowlero entertainment centers, and aims to continue to look for compelling opportunities in the massive experiential real estate market. With a 5.9% dividend yield that is well supported by its funds from operations, Vici could provide a nice combination of growth and income for years to come.\n\nA great entry point for long-term investors\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm not saying that these stocks are going to rebound to their all-time highs quickly. I have absolutely no idea what they'll do over the next few weeks or months, and if the interest rate environment stays elevated, I'd expect them to underperform in the short term. However, these are three reliable income generators with top-notch leadership, and if you measure your investment returns in decades, buying top-quality S&P 500 components like these when they are 20% or more off the highs is an excellent long-term investment strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $774,526!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Going to Crash in the Second Half of 2024? History Weighs in and Offers a Big Clue",
        "body": "Unless you've been living under a rock for the last year, you've probably noticed that the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. While a resilient U.S. economy has certainly played a role, the lion's share of the gains in the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite and benchmark S&P 500 can be attributed to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nIn simple terms, AI uses software and systems for tasks that humans would normally oversee or undertake. What makes AI special and gives the technology such wide-ranging utility is the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This can allow AI software and systems to become more proficient at tasks and perhaps even evolve to learn new skill sets.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe broad-reaching appeal of AI excited the analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) enough for them to estimate that this innovative technology could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. With dollar figures this large, there's room for multiple big-time winners.\n\nFor the time being, no company is more directly associated with the rise of AI than semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe $64,000 question is: Can Nvidia keep the good times rolling, or is a potential crash around the corner?\n\nNvidia has scaled like no market leader before it\n\nFor a very brief period this month, Nvidia pulled the crown away from Microsoft and Apple to become the most valuable publicly traded company. That's no small feat when you realize that Nvidia's market cap stood at less than $360 billion when the curtain opened for 2023.\n\nPretty much the entirety of Nvidia's $3 trillion increase in market cap over the last 18 months and its recent need to complete a 10-for-1 stock split have been fueled by the popularity of its AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the company's H100 GPUs have become the go-to chip for businesses looking to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in high-compute data centers. In terms of computability, Nvidia's chips haven't been surpassed.\n\nOn top of its first-mover advantages, Nvidia counts many of the country's most influential businesses as its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for around 40% of Nvidia's net sales. It's a testament to Nvidia that leading tech companies are lining up to use its GPUs in their AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nWe're also talking about a company that's enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its chips. Even with leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing substantially increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which is needed for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory, Nvidia isn't close to meeting enterprise demand for its GPUs. Higher prices lifted its adjusted gross margin to a jaw-dropping 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cherry on Nvidia's sundae is that it's held onto its innovative advantages. With external competitors like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices aiming to go head-to-head with the H100, Nvidia is readying to roll out its next-generation AI GPU architecture known as Blackwell.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Nvidia stock going to crash in the second half of 2024?\n\nOn paper, Nvidia can seemingly do no wrong. Wall Street's AI leader has blown past every revenue and profit forecast put in front of it for more than a year. Yet, despite this outperformance and blueprint scaling we've witnessed, the possibility of Nvidia's stock crashing in the second half of the year is within the potential range of outcomes over the next six months.\n\nHistory is the single biggest factor suggesting Nvidia has a non-zero chance of crashing in the latter half of the year. Specifically, I'm talking about the history of next-big-thing innovations/technologies and valuation-based history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the proliferation of the internet began changing corporate America's long-term growth arc. While there's no denying the internet was a game-changing innovation for businesses, it took time for this technology to mature and for businesses to figure out how they'd use direct-to-consumer channels to generate sales and profits.\n\nEvery next-big-thing innovation, technology, and trend that's come along since the internet has featured plenty of hype, big dollar figures, and a bubble-bursting event in its early stages. Whether we're talking about genome decoding, China stocks, nanotechnology, U.S. housing, 3D printing, cannabis stocks, blockchain technology, the metaverse, or the internet revolution of the mid-1990s, history conclusively shows us that all new trends and technologies need time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nAlthough Wall Street's leading businesses have no qualms about spending big on hardware for high-compute data centers, most companies lack a concrete plan as to how they're going to lean on AI to grow their sales and profits. This is consistent with previous next-big-thing innovations over the prior three decades and provides further evidence for why early-stage bubbles have occurred.\n\nCSCO PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe other history-based issue for Nvidia has to do with its valuation. In terms of its forward-year earnings multiple and price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio), Nvidia isn't raising any red flags. But pull up its trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and it's a completely different story.\n\nPrior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Cisco Systems' and Amazon's TTM P/S ratios peaked in the high 30s to low 40s. Nvidia's peak TTM P/S ratio occurred a little over a week ago at virtually the same level (about 42). While history doesn't repeat itself to a T on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme. For market-leading businesses, Nvidia is currently in rarified (and likely unsustainable) territory.\n\nUnfortunately, history isn't all that accurate at pinpointing when corrections and crashes will occur. While it's been spot-on for three decades when it comes to forecasting an eventual bubble-bursting event for next-big-thing innovations and technologies, it's anything but a guarantee that Nvidia's stock will crash during the second half of 2024.\n\nWhile Nvidia's AI hardware could be quite successful over the long run, and its market cap might motor considerably higher, allowing history to be the investors' guide suggests Nvidia's road is likely to get bumpier, at the very least, through the end of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The 160 yen level of course is a large round psychologically significant figure and an area that I think a lot of people are going to pay attention to it.

That give back should be thought of as a buying opportunity due to the fact that the interest rate differential will continue to be quite wide between the two central banks. Remember, Japan really can\u2019t do anything with its monetary policy at the moment, while the Federal Reserve, looks very likely to hang out at this level.\n\nSo, with that being said, I think you\u2019ve got a situation where you continue to buy dips.

        "body": "Walgreens' (WBA) stock is down more than 50% this year as the company continues to face retail headwinds and pivots to a brand new strategy for the pharmacy chain.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth, who has been on the job for eight months, laid out an aggressive plan to revamp the company on its third quarter earnings call Thursday.\n\nThe future Wentworth envisions is one in which pharmacies are local hubs for healthcare access.\n\nThe health ecosystem idealizes pharmacies \u2014 chains, independents, and online \u2014 as a way to maintain patient health. They have also been viewed as expert consultants in the case of minor healthcare needs ranging from advice on over-the-counter products to helping administer specialty drugs on site.\n\nWentworth wants to double down on that idea by investing in technology to help automate tasks for pharmacists in order to free them up for patients' needs.\n\n\"I am confident WBA will be a leader in the future of healthcare, with pharmacy and retail at its center,\" Wentworth said.\n\nHowever, that strategy hasn't worked in the past.\n\nTough economics\n\nThe idea of your friendly neighborhood pharmacist clashes with the economics of running a pharmacy and how they get paid by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nIt's the struggle pharmacies of all sizes face with ever-decreasing reimbursements from the three largest pharmacy benefit managers: CVS Caremark (CVS), UnitedHealth's Optum Rx (UNH), and Cigna's Express Scripts (CI), where Wentworth previously served as CEO.\n\nWentworth said he is fighting \"to align incentives and ensure we are paid fairly.\"\n\nPharmacies have been fighting since before the pandemic. The impact of consumer trends on front-of-store sales (for beauty and food items), as well as the pressure of being paid fairly for prescriptions, has been the focus of earnings calls for years \u2014 and was a catalyst for both Walgreens' and CVS's healthcare services strategy.\n\nCOVID offered a brief reprieve for pharmacies, with increased revenues from vaccines, testing, and the need for over-the-counter medications.\n\nThat has since tapered off, forcing pharmacies to reduce business hours, close stores, and reconsider how to best utilize storefronts to serve evolving patient needs.\n\nIn this June 4, 2014, file photo, people walk into a Walgreens retail store in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nLong-term view\n\nOne area in which Walgreens is ahead of the competition is clinical trials.\n\nThe company has been converting walk-in clinic spaces into clinical trial spaces and successfully clinched a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced requirements for drug companies to diversify their clinical trial participant pool, for which Walgreens is now well poised.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that didn't stop the sell-off Thursday on the news that the company would be struggling in the short term. It lead to the worst day for the company in nearly four decades, closing 22% lower Thursday.\n\nMost analysts believe the company is employing a solid strategy, but it will require patience to execute, especially as a key source of revenue, PBMs, are increasingly becoming competition.\n\nJPMorgan's Lisa Gill said in a note late Thursday that the process would take time.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in the longer-term, WBA has the potential for growth. If there is a silver lining to this print, we believe that the company is making the necessary steps to stabilize its footprint and working with PBMs and payors to manage reimbursement headwinds,\" she wrote.\n\nBank of America's Allen Lutz similarly noted, \"It is imperative that Walgreens pushes back more assertively against PBMs to capture a more reasonable return on capital.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is not fully clear if a more aggressive push by retail pharmacies would yield favorable results. However, the risk from continuing down the current path for WBA may prove worse.\"\n\nWalgreens is the largest retail pharmacy chain, with nearly 10,000 locations.

        "title": "3 ETFs That Could Benefit from a Trump Presidency",
        "body": "With election season underway, it\u2019s a good time to think about what industries and ETFs stand to benefit from a Trump presidency if the former President wins the election. The point of this article isn\u2019t to predict the outcome of the election or wade into politics, but with many observers saying that the former President won the first Presidential debate, it\u2019s a worthwhile exercise to look for ETFs representing industries and assets that could benefit significantly if Donald Trump wins and returns to the White House.\n\nHere are three ETFs: the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI), the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT), and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE).\n\nIf Trump wins in November, he will have the opportunity to appoint his own administrators and regulators to important positions. This would significantly shape U.S. policy toward various industries and make these ETFs potentially interesting investment opportunities.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI)\n\nBased on Trump\u2019s pro-crypto pivot, a Trump administration would likely unshackle the U.S. crypto industry itself, and perhaps no segment of the industry would benefit more than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners, which is what the WGMI ETF invests in.\n\nThe Biden administration previously proposed a heavy excise tax on Bitcoin miners, which would subject them to a prohibitive 30% tax on their electricity costs, effectively making Bitcoin mining in the United States untenable. It\u2019s no secret that Biden and his administration are not fans of what they view as an energy-intensive industry.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has a significantly more favorable view of the industry. In fact, Trump recently met with the CEOs of Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), two of the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin miners, to listen to their concerns and offer his support.\n\nIndustry leaders from a variety of crypto companies voiced their concerns to Trump that some of the brightest minds in the industry are leaving the U.S. because of a hostile regulatory climate, leading Trump to state, \u201cWe\u2019re going to embrace them if we want them to stay.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with them, Trump emphatically declared his support for the industry, declaring that he wants all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the U.S.\n\nWGMI is a unique and effective way to gain undiluted exposure to the stocks of Bitcoin miners. The entire ETF is devoted to Bitcoin miners as well as the semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) whose graphic processing units (GPUs) enable Bitcoin mining.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can check out an overview of WGMI\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nThis is a bit of a \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d investment, as it is a small ETF with just $123.7 million in assets under management and little in the way of diversification, as it owns just 20 stocks. Furthermore, its expense ratio of 0.75% is on the higher end.\n\nFor these reasons, an investment in WGMI likely isn\u2019t for everybody, but if Trump wins and ushers in a new administration that treats the Bitcoin mining industry more favorably, it\u2019s hard to think of an investment that would benefit more, so I\u2019m bullish on WGMI.\n\nIs WGMI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, WGMI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average WGMI stock price target of $29.56 implies 39.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT)\n\nAs noted above, a Trump administration would certainly treat the burgeoning crypto industry more favorably than the Biden administration has. Plus, Trump would have the opportunity to appoint his own regulators, which would potentially unburden the industry from many of the onerous regulations it is dealing with now.\n\nTrump has taken to his Truth Social Platform to state, \u201cOur country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place\u2026 I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.\u201d\n\nAs an ETF that gives investors undiluted exposure to Bitcoin by buying it directly, the iShares Bitcoin Trust from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is a simple, effective way to make a directional bet on Bitcoin and the growth of the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Additionally, if you don\u2019t want to take on the operational risks and other company-specific considerations that come with investing in Bitcoin miners or other crypto-related companies, IBIT offers an elegant way to simply bet on Bitcoin itself.\n\nIBIT is the largest of the new Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024, with $18.9 billion in assets under management (AUM). IBIT has taken the market by storm, reaching $10 billion in AUM in a mere 37 days, highlighting the strong demand for Bitcoin exposure by the investing public in the United States. A pro-crypto President would likely further add to Bitcoin\u2019s mainstream appeal. Also, IBIT is a cost-effective way to gain exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF, with a cost-effective expense ratio of just 0.12%.\n\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE)\n\nTrump is pro-oil and clearly more pro-oil than current President Joe Biden, so a Trump presidency would be a big boost to the U.S. shale industry. XLE is a great way to invest in this space, as it offers investors exposure to the energy sector of the S&P 500 (SPX), with large positions in energy majors like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) plus other top U.S. oil stocks.\n\nYou can check out an overview of XLE\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nFurthermore, XLE comes with an above-average dividend yield of 3.2% and charges a very small fee with an expense ratio of just 0.09%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $9 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIs XLE Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XLE earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XLE stock price target of $109.03 implies 19.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\nLooking Ahead to November\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say who will win the Presidential Election in the U.S., and the purpose of this article is not to forecast or endorse a winner.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s never too early to look ahead, and it\u2019s never a bad idea for investors to think about what industries and investments could see upside or downside based on elections. Additionally, investors should consider positioning their portfolios to capitalize on these potential changes.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on these three ETFs, WGMI, IBIT, and XLE, as they could all be major beneficiaries of a Trump win in November. This is based on the fact that a Trump administration would regulate and treat the Energy and Cryptocurrency industries very differently than the current Biden administration has.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Bounce Back in the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "It's been a rough first half for some investors. If you owned shares of UiPath (NYSE: PATH), Chegg (NYSE: CHGG), and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) since the start of 2024, you're in a world of hurt. The three stocks are down between 36% and 74% so far this year.\n\nIt doesn't have to stay that way. I think all three stocks have a chance to deliver meaningful gains in the final six months of 2024. They may not make back the ground they lost in the first half of this year, but even a modest bounce from these humble starting lines can beat the market. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. UiPath, Down 49%\n\nIt's hard to believe that UiPath has been roughly cut in half this year. As a leading provider of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence software solutions, this should be a fertile stock in 2024. Between wage inflation driving labor expenses higher and companies trying to gain an operational edge, UiPath's tech platform for robotic process automation should be a dinner bell. So far this year, it's been a fire alarm.\n\nUiPath's biggest hit came in late May following a poorly received quarterly report. Weak guidance and losing its second CEO this year weren't bullish events. Now it's time to see if the dramatic markdown here is ripe for a comeback story.\n\nUiPath began the year with a pair of CEOs. Co-founder Daniel Dines, who was serving as co-CEO, stepped down in January. His fellow helmsman backed out at the end of May following the brutal financial update after just a couple of months as lone CEO. Dines agreed to return to the corner office.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowth has slowed at UiPath. The 16% revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter is about half the year-over-year jump it posted three months earlier. Its latest guidance suggests that the top line will continue to decelerate. The news isn't necessarily any better on the bottom line. UiPath remains profitable on an adjusted basis, but it's not expected to return to reported profitability until 2027.\n\nWhy should one be optimistic in the near term here? Well, despite the uninspiring guidance for the balance of 2024, analysts see revenue accelerating from 8% this fiscal year to 12% next year. It has a cash-rich balance sheet that shaves its current $7.3 billion market cap to an enterprise value of just $5.4 billion. It's going through some hiccups, but it still topped $100 million in adjusted free cash flow in its latest quarter, and it has found a way to exceed Wall Street's profit targets in each of the last four quarters. Dines is back, and what a great name to ring the dinner bell again.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Chegg, Down 74%\n\nThe biggest sinker on this list is Chegg. The homework help specialist has been reeling since warning that ChatGPT is eating away at its business nearly 14 months ago. It was sputtering before it said the obvious. It has posted negative year-over-year revenue growth for eight consecutive quarters. However, those were single-digit top-line declines. Guidance calls for a slide of 12% to 13% in the current quarter.\n\nChegg knows the assignment. It's a study help pro, after all. The new CEO who took over last month was the chief operating officer who set the company on the track to embrace AI to avoid disruption well before the market knew there was a problem. Chegg also remains very profitable. It's trading for less than 3 times trailing and forward adjusted earnings. The multiple is still less than five if you prefer to go with enterprise value instead of market cap. The price-to-free-cash-flow multiple is even lower.\n\nChegg is a money tree, but it has mistakenly spent a lot of that greenery on buying back shares at much higher price points. It spent more than $300 million on repurchases last year alone, more than enough to swallow its entire remaining share count at today's deeply discounted prices. Last week it announced that it would be reducing its workforce by 23%, a move that will help shave costs as it puts more effort into leading the way in AI-fueled educational tools.\n\n3. Roku, Down 36%\n\nLet's close with Roku. The popular TV streaming enabler is doing well on some fronts. Revenue and user counts are growing in the double digits, and engagement has never been stronger. However, a lack of profitability, near-term competitive concerns, and sluggish connected TV advertising growth are weighing on the niche pioneer.\n\nRoku is volatile, and it has a knack for bouncing back after a sell-off. The stock isn't likely to return to its 2021 peak anytime soon, but the business is a lot larger and its reach much wider since then. If recent efforts to prioritize initiatives that will deliver strong early returns pay off, Roku will be more than just a four-letter word to investors who have been burned in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Coca-Cola: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "body": "It's not just one of the world's best-known brand names. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has also been -- and continues to be -- one of the world's more rewarding investments. Plenty of buy-and-hold investors have become millionaires while sitting on a long-term stake in Coca-Cola stock, well-rewarded for their patience.\n\nThe biggest name in the beverage business, however, isn't the company behind the industry's most rewarding stock. That honor actually belongs to shares of rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP).\n\nAnd the underpinnings of its superior performance aren't apt to change in the foreseeable future either.\n\nNumbers (and pictures) don't lie\n\nSurprised? It would be a little surprising if you weren't. Coca-Cola is viewed by most as the premier name in the drinks business, after all. But, it's true. Over the past 50 years, PepsiCo's share price has outgained Coke's nearly threefold.\n\nKO Chart\n\nVeteran investors will point out that Coke is dividend royalty -- literally. It hasn't just paid a quarterly dividend for decades now. It's also raised its full-year payout every year for the past 62 years, qualifying it as a Dividend King. As it stands right now only 53 stocks are eligible for the title.\n\nCare to guess one of the market's other Dividend Kings? If you said PepsiCo, you're right! It's raised its total yearly dividends for 52 consecutive years now. While its dividend-growth track record isn't quite as lengthy, the company's been upping its payouts at a measurably faster clip.\n\nKO Chart\n\nThe big question here, of course, is how? How is PepsiCo able to do what its bigger rival couldn't for its respective shareholders?\n\nThe answer is multifaceted, but it isn't complicated.\n\nPepsiCo is different than Coca-Cola in all the ways that matter\n\nTo fully understand how PepsiCo has achieved the unthinkable, take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\nPepsiCo isn't just a beverage company. Roughly half of its top line is actually driven by its snack foods segment made up of several familiar brand names including Doritos, Rold Gold pretzels, Fritos, Cheetos, and of course, Lay's potato chips. The North America snack foods division alone accounts for roughly half of the entire company's operating profits thanks to its far greater profit margins than the highly competitive beverage business could ever support. All told, Frito-Lay's operating profit margin is consistently in the ballpark of 25% of sales.\n\nCoca-Cola's operating margin is similar at around 20% of revenue, for the record. But, Coke's business is distinctly different than PepsiCo's drinks and snacks operation. Whereas PepsiCo does most of its own bottling and handles the bulk of its own food production, Coca-Cola's business model is largely royalty-focused -- the company punts the bulk of its production work to third-party bottlers that simply purchase Coke's concentrated syrups and pay franchise fees for the right to distribute its brand-name products.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a high-margin business model to be sure. But its revenue potential is also modest. Although Coca-Cola's brands of beverages easily outsell PepsiCo's in terms of the total amount of revenue produced, the company itself only collected $45.8 billion worth of sales last year, turning $11.3 billion of that into operating income. PepsiCo banked greater operating profits of just under $12 billion in 2023, reporting cash flow of $13.4 billion versus Coca-Cola's $11.6 billion.\n\nNo, PepsiCo isn't producing leaps and bounds more earnings and higher profit margins than its top beverage rival is. The nickels and dimes add up over time, however.\n\nIt's worth adding that while Coke's royalty/franchise model punts much of the risk of being a bottler to its partner bottlers, it also means Coca-Cola loses a bit of control of the production process. PepsiCo may not like operating its own production facilities, but having complete oversight of them still offers a strategic advantage. One of these advantages is being able to serve as a bottler for other brands including competing soft drink brands like Dr. Pepper, energy drink upstarts like Celsius, as well as juice brand Ocean Spray.\n\nPepsiCo's stock-buyback and stock-retirement programs are also consistently more shareholder-friendly than Coca-Cola's. Since mid-2004, PepsiCo has reduced its share count by more than 20%, versus Coke's reduction of just a little more than 11%.\n\nKO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) Chart\n\nJust buy PepsiCo stock and forget about it already\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, of course, meaning there's no assurance PepsiCo shares will continue minting more millionaires than more popular Coca-Cola stock does. Besides, there's more to stock-picking than mere numbers.\n\nThe underpinnings of these two stocks' different performances are largely rooted in each companies' products, operations, and corporate ethos though. Those are things that are unlikely to change anytime soon. And PepsiCo's management certainly doesn't want them to.\n\nBottom line? If you're considering a new position in either of these companies to round out the consumer goods portion of your portfolio, PepsiCo is (surprisingly enough) the better option at this time. That's particularly true in light of the fact that you'd be plugging in while its shares' forward-looking dividend yield stands at 3.24% versus Coke's lesser yield of just over 3%.\n\nDon't overthink this. More than that though, don't let your investing judgment be clouded by your personal preference or nostalgia for a particular brand of beverages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Want $1,000 in Super-Safe Dividend Income? Buy $11,862 of This Ultra-High-Dividend Yield Stock",
        "body": "Investors love tobacco stocks because of their high dividend yields and growing dividend payouts. Long-term shareholders in these companies have made a fortune by simply holding and watching the dividend payments pile up in their accounts.\n\nToday, Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has a dividend yield of 8.43%. The United States-focused tobacco giant can generate $1,000 in annual dividend income for investors who buy $11,862 worth of stock right now. But is this dividend sustainable? Is Altria Group a safe dividend stock today?\n\nI think it is. Here's why Altria Group is a smart play for investors looking to build a diversified dividend income portfolio.\n\nVolume declines, but rising new categories\n\nAltria Group owns the U.S. brand of Marlboro, which is the top premium cigarette in the country with around 40% market share. This dominance has been retained for decades. However, investors are worried about accelerating overall volume declines in the cigarette category, which has caused stocks such as Altria to underperform the market.\n\nFor example, last quarter Altria estimated that cigarette volumes declined by 9% year over year for the entire U.S. market. Despite this, the company's net revenue for smokeable products only declined by 2.3%, with segment operating profit declining by a similar amount as well. While this isn't an ideal situation, Altria has been able to raise prices to counteract volume declines for decades to maintain profits.\n\nSmokeable products are the majority of Altria's $11.4 billion in operating profits today, but they're increasingly getting replaced by new nicotine products in vaping and nicotine pouches. The company's recent acquisition of the Njoy brand has a market share of 4.3%, which grew by 0.6 percentage points last quarter. Now, the U.S. government and law enforcement are increasing crackdowns on illegal vaping devices, which should help Njoy greatly increase market share.\n\nOn top of this, the On! nicotine pouch brand grew shipment volumes by 32% year over year last quarter. It is still a tiny part of the brand portfolio but should continue to grow quickly. It might help too that the largest competitor in nicotine pouches, Zyn, is seeing supply shortages in the United States right now.\n\nThe dividend is not only safe, but can grow\n\nRecent 9% volume declines and a 2% decrease in profits for the smokeable category are concerning for investors. However, running the math on Altria's dividend payout shows the 8%+ dividend yield is here to stay.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Altria has paid a dividend per share of $3.88. Free cash flow per share -- the fuel for dividend payments -- was $5 and has been consistently above the dividend per share for the last five years. Altria is also reducing its shares outstanding through a stock buyback program, which has brought shares outstanding down by a cumulative 8% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving 8% fewer shares means an 8% lower cumulative dividend payout while maintaining the same dividend per share level. It also helps free cash flow per share grow, even if nominal free cash flow is flat. So, even if Altria's earnings stagnate due to heavy volume declines, the company has plenty of room to grow its dividend per share due to the wide spread between its dividend payout and free cash flow along with the consistent buyback program.\n\nMO Dividend Yield Chart\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nWith such a high dividend yield, I think contrarian investors looking to build retirement income are smart to buy Altria Group stock today. Its dividend yield has gone from less than 4% to over 8% in the last 10 years as the stock has suffered. But the business is still in fine shape and has the earnings power to maintain a growing dividend over the next five years and beyond.\n\nBuying a little over $11,000 of Altria stock can deliver $1,000 in dividend income to your portfolio every year. Investors should remember to diversify their holdings, though. If $11,000 is a large investment for you, start with a smaller amount and build up your dividend income by buying more shares over time. It is never smart to go all in on one stock, as no company is a risk-free investment. The same holds true for Altria and any other tobacco stock.\n\nWith investors piling into technology and AI stocks at huge earnings multiples, it may be smart to zig while others are zagging and buy some high-dividend-yield stocks like Altria Group in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Altria Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "After Nvidia's Stock Split and 150% First-Half Gain, Will It Soar in the Second Half? Here's What History Says.",
        "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has probably been the most watched stock on the planet over the past several months. This is because the company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and its soaring revenue has prompted the stock to skyrocket. In the first half, the shares soared more than 150% -- and that's after already gaining more than 1,300% in the previous five years.\n\nIn fact, this momentum pushed Nvidia stock past the threshold of $1,000, a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors -- and in other cases makes it difficult for small investors to buy without relying on fractional shares. So Nvidia launched a stock split recently to bring down the price of each individual share. Investors welcomed the news, and the stock rallied nearly 30% from the split announcement through the actual operation.\n\nNow, though, the big question is whether Nvidia's momentum will continue post-split and whether this top chip designer will soar in the second half. Let's look to history for some answers.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLooking at historical patterns\n\nFirst, it's important to note that just because a certain pattern occurred in the past doesn't guarantee the same pattern will continue in the future. So, any conclusions we draw may guide us -- but they aren't set in stone. The market or a particular stock may surprise us.\n\nThat said, patterns do replicate frequently enough to make them worth our consideration. They may offer us an idea of what generally happens after a certain event, making us aware of likely possibilities.\n\nLet's move on to the idea of stock splits and what history shows. A stock split, through the issuance of new shares to current holders, lowers the price of each individual share -- but without changing the market value of the company or the valuation of the stock. So, the operation hasn't changed anything fundamental about the particular company or stock.\n\nBut the split accomplishes one major thing: It opens the investment opportunity up to a broader range of investors. This is positive for you and me because it makes it easier for us to invest in a company like Nvidia, and it's positive for the company because it offers it a whole new audience of potential investors. So it's a win-win situation. Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split brought the stock price down from more than $1,000 to about $125.\n\nStock splits in and of themselves, since they're just mechanical operations, aren't catalysts for stock performance -- you wouldn't buy a stock just because the company launched a split. But, as you can see in the chart, below, history shows that stock split players tend to outperform the S&P 500 in the 12 months following the stock split announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nData source: Statista.\n\nThe chart shows that stock split companies have generated an average total return of more than 25% in that 12-month period. That's compared to less than 12% for the S&P 500 as a whole. This is based on Bank of America's Research Investment Committee data from 1980 through today.\n\nNvidia's past stock splits\n\nNow we can dig deeper by looking at Nvidia itself after its past two stock splits, in 2007 and 2021. After both, the stock declined in the 12 months that followed -- but first, the shares advanced in the two to five months after the operation. Nvidia stock climbed more than 60% in the five months following the 2021 split and added about 17% in the six-week period following the 2007 split.\n\nSo, what does all of this tell us about what may happen today? It's important to keep in mind that Nvidia's business has greatly evolved since the past stock splits. Then, it mainly served the video gaming industry and progressively was moving into other areas, such as AI. Today, the high-growth field of AI is the company's main business, making the stock significantly more attractive to investors. So Nvidia may have stronger momentum today than it did after previous splits -- and that might make a lasting rally possible.\n\nThis can happen if Nvidia continues to report impressive earnings growth and deliver on product launch goals. And things look promising. Nvidia has reported quarter after quarter of record revenue and says demand for its soon-to-launch Blackwell architecture and chip surpasses supply. And speaking of Blackwell, this launch, too, could be a positive catalyst for the stock.\n\nAll of this means it's very possible Nvidia stock will soar in the second half, thanks to the company's leadership in a high-growth market and solid revenue prospects. And the best news is this: Even if history is wrong and Nvidia doesn't rally in the coming months, this top stock still has what it takes to deliver big returns to investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n12 hours ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at \u00a35. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. \u201cThrough the launch of our repair service, we\u2019re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London\u2019s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "body": "Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases\n\n18 hours ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work.

        "body": "Are rainy days ahead for cloud computing?\n\n1 day ago By Sean McManus , Technology reporter Share\n\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson David Heinemeier Hansson saved his firm serious money by leaving the cloud\n\nThis year, software firm 37signals will see a profit boost of more than $1m (\u00a3790,000) from leaving the cloud. \u201cTo be able to get that with such relatively modest changes to our business is astounding,\u201d says co-owner and chief technology officer, David Heinemeier Hansson. The US company has millions of users for its online project management and productivity software, including Basecamp and Hey. Like many companies it outsourced data storage and computing to a third party firm, a so-called cloud services provider. They own huge data centres, where they host data from other firms, which can be accessed over the internet. In 2022, such services cost 37signals $3.2m. \u201cSeeing the bill on a weekly basis really radicalised me,\u201d Mr Heinemeier Hansson says. \"I went: \u2018Wait! What are we spending for a week of rentals?\u2019 I could buy some really powerful computers just on one week\u2019s worth of [cloud] spending.\u201d So, he did. Buying hardware and hosting it in a shared data centre costs $840,000 per year. Although costs pushed Mr Heinemeier Hansson to act, other factors were also a concern. The internet is engineered to be highly resilient. \u201cI saw the distributed design erode as more and more companies gravitated essentially to three owners of computers,\u201d he says, referring to the three leading cloud providers. If a major data centre goes down, large parts of the web can go offline. The cloud was pitched, he says, as cheaper, easier, and faster. \u201cThe cloud was not able to make things easier to a point where we could measure any productivity gains,\u201d he says, noting his operations team has always been about the same size.\n\nWas using the cloud faster? \u201cYes, but it didn\u2019t matter,\" says Mr Heinemeier Hansson. \"If you want to connect a hundred servers to the internet, you can do it in less than five minutes [in the cloud]. That\u2019s incredible. \"But we do not need, nor do I believe the vast majority of companies need, a five-minute turnaround on a massive number of additional servers.\u201d He can have new servers delivered and racked in his data centre in a week, which is fast enough. 37signals does use the cloud for experimenting with new products. \u201cWe needed to have some big machines, but we only needed them for 20 minutes,\u201d Mr Heinemeier Hansson says. \u201cThe cloud is ideal for that. It would be wasteful to buy that computer and let it stay idle for 99.99% of the time.\u201d He still recommends the cloud to fledgling businesses. \u201cWhen you have a speculative start-up and there\u2019s great uncertainty as to whether you\u2019re going to be around in 18 months, you should absolutely not spend your money buying computers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should rent them.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Cloud computing has created huge businesses like AWS and Microsoft's Azure\n\n37signals is not alone in bringing workloads back from the cloud, which is known as cloud repatriation. Digital workspace company Citrix found that 94% of large US organisations it surveyed had worked on repatriating data or workloads from the cloud in the last three years.

It built its own private data centres and repatriated cloud workloads to them, saving an estimated 30% to 40% in costs after two years. \u201cA key factor in our decision was that we have highly proprietary R&D data and code that must remain strictly secure,\u201d says Markus Schaal, managing director at the German firm. \u201cIf our investments in features, patches, and games were leaked, it would be an advantage to our competitors. While the public cloud offers security features, we ultimately determined we needed outright control over our sensitive intellectual property. \"As our AI-assisted modelling tools advanced, we also required significantly more processing power that the cloud could not meet within budget.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe encountered occasional performance issues during heavy usage periods and limited customisation options through the cloud interface.

One such client is LinkPool, which enables smart contracting using blockchain. It was developed in public cloud, initially using free credits.

        "title": "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early",
        "body": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n22 hours ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",

        "body": "More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues\n\n17 hours ago Share\n\nGetty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights\n\nAer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the \u201cindefinite nature\u201d of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots\u2019 industrial action it \u201cmust cancel\u201d additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I\u2019m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they\u2019ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. \u201cTrying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: \u2018Because you\u2019re a group we can\u2019t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don\u2019t open until 9am\u2019.\u201d Mr McWatters told the BBC\u2019s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been \u201cleft high and dry\u201d, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. \u201cAt that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,\u201d he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had \u201cfallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children\u201d. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don\u2019t meet you, we do every day. \"We\u2019ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we\u2019re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don\u2019t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union F\u00f3rsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RT\u00c9 has reported. If sanctioned, F\u00f3rsa will have to give seven days\u2019 notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is \"willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis\". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and F\u00f3rsa to \"agree to this step\".\n\nHow many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?\n\nAll Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about \u20ac36,000 (\u00a330,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about \u20ac287,000 (\u00a3242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nWhat do I do if my Aer Lingus flight is cancelled?",

        "body": "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\n\n21 hours ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \"a monster\" and that he was \"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

        "title": "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal",
        "body": "Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\n\n2 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\n\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\" she said. \"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\"\n\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \"releases\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \" he wrote. \"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\".\n\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\n\nGetty Images",

        "body": "IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\n\n2 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\n\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \"clearly\" wanted him to say that \"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\".\n\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\n\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \"perfect\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \"fairly chaotic\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\". Mr Jenkins said this was \"totally inappropriate wording\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \"afflicted\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \"other reasons\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\n\nGuidance sought\n\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data \u201cprobably needs some further investigation\u201d. However, he said the decision to do so would be \u201chighly political\u201d. \"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \"what exactly we should be doing\". Mr Beer asked: \"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\" Mr Jenkins replied: \"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\" \"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\" Mr Jenkins responded: \"I don't know what to say to that.\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\n\n'I can't remember what I believed'",

        "body": "'How will we afford children with rent increases?'\n\n2 days ago By Alix Hattenstone, Miguel Roca-Terry and Jonathan Fagg , BBC England Data Unit Share\n\nDelia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage\n\nThe average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost \u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \u201cchronic shortage\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\n\n'All of us have been homeless'\n\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \u201cI was looking at my friends \u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\u2019t afford a house?\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \u00a31,312 to \u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\n\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\n\nHow has rent changed in your area?\n\nWhy has rent been increasing?\n\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \"geometric average\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\" he said. \"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\n\nWhere has rent increased the most?\n\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \u00a3555 in December 2019, to \u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\n\n'It was like a bidding war'\n\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \u2018mini budget\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth. This included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed \"Liz Truss' botched budget\" for \"driving up rents for tenants\" and a Labour spokesperson said \"time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters\". A Conservative Party spokesman said \u201cCovid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels\u201d, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. \u201cPeople were offering over the asking price or six months\u2019 rent up front. I wasn\u2019t in a position to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like a bidding war \u2013 I\u2019d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.\u201d Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for \u00a3900 per month. She said: \u201cI feel sorry for my children because my daughter\u2019s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 \u2013 he has to help me out with rent. He\u2019s unable to save up for his future.\u201d\n\nHow does your area compare to the rest of England?\n\nWhat do the different parties promise on rent?\n\nConservatives: Build 1.6 million homes over five years, introduce a new Help to Buy scheme requiring a 5% deposit and scrap stamp duty for properties up to \u00a3425,000 Labour: Help build 1.5 million homes over five years, introduce a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers, and end rental bidding wars. Extend protections around damp, mould and cold. Liberal Democrats: Build 380,000 homes a year and make three-year tenancies the default Reform UK: Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system for social housing, and encourage more people to become landlords by scrapping some taxes Green Party: Create 150,000 new social homes a year, implement rent controls and bring empty homes back into use",

        "title": "Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?",
        "body": "Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?\n\n2 days ago By Kevin Keane , BBC Scotland environment correspondent Share\n\nPA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing\n\n\"Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?\" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \"unlicenced\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\n\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\n\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\n\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \"at risk\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\n\nJob forecasts",

In the first three months of 2024 the company saw a net loss of more than $1.4bn.\n\nVW, like other motor industry giants, has come under pressure from rivals like Tesla and China's BYD as it tries to make the shift from fossil fuel-powered vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, some EV start-ups have struggled to make headway in the highly competitive market and as higher interest rates hit demand for big ticket purchases.\n\nThe partnership will give VW immediate access to Rivian's software allowing the German car maker to use it in its cars.\n\nMotor industry giants like VW have also been facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers, which have been expanding globally.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union (EU) warned that it will raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports by as much as 38%.\n\nOfficials from China and the EU have held talks ahead of a 4 July deadline.\n\nA months-long investigation by the European Commission found that Chinese EV companies had been \"unfairly subsidised\".\n\nIn response, China said the tariffs violated international trade rules and described the investigation as \"protectionism\".\n\nThe plan came just a month after the US said it will increase import levies on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%.\n\nThis week, Canada said that it was considering a similar move to align itself with allies.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Tesla said it would recall most of its Cybertrucks sold in the US over issues with their windscreen wipers and exterior trim.\n\nThe recalls cover more than 11,000 of the vehicles, which first went on sale at the end of November last year.",

        "title": "Tata Steel: Families put plans on hold amid job loss worries",
        "body": "Steelwork closures' ripple effect on town's wages\n\n3 days ago By Paul Heaney , BBC Wales Investigates Share\n\nOwen Midwinter Owen and his girlfriend Cori are just some of thousands affected by the decision to close blast furnaces at Port Talbot Steelworks\n\nOwen Midwinter thought he had a \"job for life\" when he started a five-year apprenticeship at Tata Steel in Port Talbot. But 18 months on, that security has been replaced with uncertainty - and the 23-year-old and his girlfriend may have to delay their plans to start a family. New analysis for the BBC suggests his town could lose more than \u00a3200m in wages because of job cuts at the steelworks. Prof Calvin Jones, its author, said it was an \"end of an era\" for UK steelmaking, similar to the closure of coal mines in the 1980s.\n\nMr Midwinter said of when the job losses were announced: \"Everyone in the room went silent... wives and girlfriends were ringing, one of the boys had to go for a walk to clear his head. \"My old man\u2019s been here for years and years, my grandfather\u2019s been here and it was a proud moment for me. But it\u2019s very sombre now, a lot of sad faces, lot of depression.\" His girlfriend, Cori, said: \"If Owen loses his job it puts the house at risk, we want to start a family soon, but it puts everything at risk until we know.\"\n\nTown of Steel - BBC Wales Investigates Watch the full programme on BBC iPlayer.\n\nTata said it needed to \"act now\" to protect the future of the business by closing blast furnaces and moving to greener ways of producing steel, which require fewer people. Some experts say a lack of a clear strategy by successive UK governments is behind the job cuts in the well-paid industry, which may never be replaced.\n\nMandie Pugh hasn't lost her sense of humour, but is worried about her business and her family\n\nBut it is not just steelworkers who are facing uncertainty. A stone's throw from the Port Talbot plant that dominates the skyline in this part of the south Wales coast, Mandie Pugh runs a catering business built on the trade of the workers. \"I\u2019ve been here 35 years, a long time, and I\u2019m too young to retire,\" she said. \"Contractors, small businesses, from the vegetable man to the window cleaner, people are not going to be able to afford as much any more. \"My husband works at the steelworks, my son is in the control room in the blast furnace so he\u2019s out of a job, he\u2019s just had a baby not long ago, he and his partner are looking for a house so that\u2019s put the kibosh on that. \"I\u2019m gutted for him.\"\n\nProfessor Calvin Jones said the most \"alarming\" figures were on the impact of wages in the town\n\nProf Jones, from Cardiff University, carried out the research for BBC Wales Investigates. It suggests that the 2,000 or so jobs lost directly at Tata sites in Wales could be joined by a further 3,000 roles that rely on Tata for trade. But he said the most \"alarming\" figures were on the impact of wages in Port Talbot. The economics professor estimated the job losses at Tata would see a 10% drop in the town's gross earnings - \u00a3133m a year. If half of the supply companies were based locally, he estimated the drop in earnings would be 15% - more than \u00a3200m. \"That's \u00a3200m a year gone from a local economy until those people find new jobs or other employment comes in. \"So, I guess the question will be what happens instead? \"We have not had an industrial strategy worthy of the name for 40 years\u2026 we don't seem to know where we want to go industrially, so it's no surprise you don't get there. \u201cI think more widely, in the same way as the miners strike and thereafter, it was the end of the era for the valleys, this is the end of an era for industrial south Wales.\u201d\n\nJess Ralston has researched the steel industry for the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank\n\n\u201cIt's heartbreaking to see any sort of job losses, but on this scale it's really quite shocking\u2026 the industry is crying out for a clear plan.\u201d Jess Ralston has researched how countries across Europe are supporting the steel industry to modernise and reduce carbon emissions. \u201cThe new economic reality is the rest of the world is moving towards greener solutions, greener steel.\" She said Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands were \"putting out feelers\" for investment, but the UK was \"standing at the side waiting for the investment to come to them\". \"We've got just one or two green steel projects in the pipeline, Europe has around 40 and it's not just Europe, China, the US, the rest of the world is also looking at the future of steel, and the UK can't really afford to stand still.\"\n\nTata Steel's site in Port Talbot is set to lose the bulk of almost 3,000 jobs across the UK\n\nRajesh Nair, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said he knew how \"painful\" the move would be after 35 years in the industry. \"We are haemorrhaging cash, and it's not because of the lack of efforts of the people or the amount of money that we have been spending, it's simply because we have a set of assets which are end of life. \"We are today as a business, at a fork in the road\u2026 it's either now or never.\u201d\n\nStuart Phillips said he thought working at the Port Talbot steelworks was a job for life\n\nStuart Phillips, 43, has two daughters aged three and 18, and a mortgage. \u201cI\u2019m probably looking for another 15 years' work, and the difficulty I\u2019ve got is Tata Steel is all I\u2019ve ever known. \"It\u2019s quite devastating.\"\n\nStuart Phillips Stuart Phillips has two daughters\n\nImported steel will still be rolled and if the \u00a3500m deal with the current Conservative government is signed off, a new electric arc furnace will be built on the site securing some jobs. Labour said it would offer a better deal, without giving details, and Plaid Cymru argued Tata\u2019s site at Port Talbot ought to be nationalised to support a \"just transition\" to \"green steel\". The Liberal Democrats want a long term vision for the steel industry, while the Reform party said there was a risk the steel works would be a casualty of the \"net zero vanity projects\". The Green Party has called for a green industrial strategy to create sustainable, green jobs. Ms Ralston said it was the decisions of politicians \u2013 past, present and future \u2013 which would dictate the future of the industry. \u201cTata at the end of the day are a multinational company\u2026if the UK doesn't have a very good investment landscape, they don't need to put it here.\u201d",

        "title": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?",
        "body": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?\n\n2 days ago By Emma Woollacott , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores\n\nAmazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.\n\nAmazon was quick to claim that the reports were \u201cerroneous\u201d, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that \u201cthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common\u201d. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question \u2013 whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d in reference to the environmental \"green washing\".\n\nBut first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called \"generative AI\". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. \"Some founders seem to believe that if they don\u2019t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,\" says Mr Ayangar. \"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.\"\n\nSri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI\n\nIt is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as \"AI start-ups\" in fact used virtually no AI at all. \"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,\" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that \"cutting-edge AI capabilities\" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.\n\nDouglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. \"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. \"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.\" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: \"If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.\"\n\nRegulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. \"The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,\" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nNick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem",

        "body": "The screen tech that can do almost anything\n\n4 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nLink\u00f6ping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. \u201cThis is difficult but we think it\u2019s possible.\" In today\u2019s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone\u2019s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice demonstration\u2026 it\u2019s very new,\u201d says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled \u2013 at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. \u201cBy slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,\u201d says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. \u201cIf you think about mass production, this is gigantic.\u201d There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable \u2013 they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue \u2013 the key hues required for full colour digital displays.\n\nTo keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there\u2019s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn\u2019t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV\u2019s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It\u2019s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today\u2019s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.\n\nHelio Helio's film can re-emit blue light as either red or green with little light loss\n\nThe technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren\u2019t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.",

        "title": "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'",
        "body": "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'\n\n5 days ago By Sameer Hashmi , Middle East Business Correspondent BBC News Share\n\nShutterstock The Line, a planned 170km long linear city, may now initially extend for only 2.4km\n\n\u201cThey can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.\u201d That was the response of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia\u2019s flagship construction projects. Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true. In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030. This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state\u2019s de-facto ruler, to transition the country\u2019s economy away from oil-dependency. As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or \u201cgiga projects\u201d as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.\n\nBut low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies. An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon. \u201cThe decision will be based on multiple factors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.\u201d Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (\u00a3394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country. The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.\n\nGetty Images Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to diversify the country's economy\n\nThe original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants. But according to people familiar with the details \u2013 and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module. When The Line was first announced it was billed as a \u201ccarbon-free linear city\u201d that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids. The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits. How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear. Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029. Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately \u201cdesigned to be over ambitious\u201d. \u201cIt was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,\u201d says Mr Shihabi.\n\nThe scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing. Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country\u2019s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world\u2019s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year. The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.\n\nTim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future. \u201cIt is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,\u201d Mr Callen says. The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital. Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019. The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production. Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel. The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh\u2019s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors. \u2018It\u2019s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,\u201d says Mr Callen. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.\u201d The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.",

        "title": "PG: Earnings Consistency, Strong Momentum Heading Into FY 2025 (NYSE:PG)",
        "body": "RobsonPL/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\n\nConsumer Staples stocks have quietly produced gains so far this quarter, nearly keeping pace with the tech-dominated S&P 500. While there has been an uptick just recently in Consumer Discretionary stocks, namely a fresh high in shares of Amazon (AMZN), many blue-chip Staples continue to trade at premium valuation multiples in the face of a booming broader market. I believe that will generally persist.\n\nI am upgrading The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) from a sell to a hold. I questioned its valuation and pointed out technical risks early last year, but failed to appreciate the durability of the company and its management\u2019s execution. While I do not see the stock as a bargain today, risks appear balanced. Shares have returned 23% since the original analysis compared to a 35% S&P 500 performance.\n\nQTD S&P 500 Sector Performances: Staples Holding Up Well\n\nKoyfin Charts\n\nAccording to Bank of America Global Research, Procter & Gamble, one of the world's largest consumer products companies, operates under five segments: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby & Family Care. Brands include Pampers, Tide, Bounty, Charmin, Gillette, Oral B, Crest, Olay, Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Ariel, Gain, Always, Tampax, Downy, and Dawn.\n\nBack in April, PG reported a mixed set of quarterly results. Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 beat the Wall Street consensus forecast of $1.41 while sales of $20.2 billion, up just 0.6% from year-ago levels, was a $240 million miss. But the company raised its FY 2024 diluted net EPS growth rate from a range of \u20131% to flat to +1% to +2% compared with the previous year\u2019s $5.90 total. Core net EPS growth was also increased to the 10% to 11% range y/y. The firm expects to reward shareholders with more than $9 billion in dividends while it buys back $5 to $6 billion in stock this year.\n\nAfter registering 3% y/y organic revenue growth in Q3, all eyes are on the upcoming quarter which featured a higher US Dollar Index and likely more soft numbers out of China and the Middle East. North America sales may be steady in the low-to-mid single-digit range and another strong showing from Europe, which was +7% in the previous quarter, would be a significant tailwind.\n\nCommodities have been held in check for the most part this year, but any further rise in the price of oil, perhaps toward the $90 mark later this summer, would be a challenge for PG. Ahead of the July 30 Q4 report, the options market has priced in a small 2.2% earnings-related stock price swing when analyzing the at-the-money straddle expiring soonest after the report, according to data from Option Research & Technology Services.\n\nKey risks for the company include weaker-than-expected sales growth in the quarters ahead, potentially due to increased competition from private label brands and a broader market upturn which may result in more cyclical areas of the market outperforming. Furthermore, additional strength in the US dollar would be at least a temporary hit to earnings.\n\nOn earnings, analysts at BofA see operating EPS rising sharply this year with continued robust growth through the out year and 2026. The current Seeking Alpha consensus forecast shows comparable non-GAAP per-share earnings advancement in the coming years while PG\u2019s top line is seen rising at a steady pace between 2.9% and 3.9%.\n\nDividends, meanwhile, are expected to increase from $3.83 this year to potentially above $4.25 by year-end 2026, resulting in a dividend yield that could grow to be more than twice that of the S&P 500. While the company\u2019s free cash flow yield is not extremely high, the firm is executing well after shedding some non-core businesses in recent years.\n\nPG: Earnings, Valuation, Dividend Yield, Free Cash Flow Yield Forecasts\n\nBofA Global Research\n\nOn valuation, PG has historically traded with a significant P/E premium due to its stability even during periods of economic stress. Still, the current earnings multiple is a full turn above its 5-year average. If we assume normalized non-GAAP EPS of $6.70 over the next 12 months, very close to the current consensus, and apply a 5-year average forward P/E, then shares should trade near $164, putting the stock about fairly valued. PG shares are also modestly expensive on a price-to-sales basis.\n\nPG: Shares Trade Near the Historic P/E, Slightly Elevated P/S\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nCompared to its peers, PG features a weak valuation rating, but that is common among the steadiest large-cap Staples stocks. With a lukewarm growth trajectory, PG\u2019s profitability metrics are about the best you\u2019ll find across the sector. What\u2019s more, PG has topped EPS estimates time and again, leading to strong sellside EPS revisions over the past 90 days. Finally, share-price momentum continues to run strong with the stock near all-time highs.\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLooking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed Q4 2024 earnings date of Tuesday, July 30 BMO with a conference call immediately after the numbers hit the tape. You can listen live here. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.\n\nCorporate Event Risk Calendar\n\nWall Street Horizon\n\nThe Technical Take\n\nI was bearish on PG early last year at precisely the wrong time. Mea culpa. Shares had been consolidating after moving lower from a January 2023 peak near $155. Despite a dip under the 200-day moving average, the bulls took charge and a broad uptrend was underway. Jump ahead to today, and the stock is very close to all-time highs, rising above the January 2022 previous peak above $165.

        "title": "Prices Decline In May, Monetary Policy Tightens",
        "body": "Fokusiert\n\nThe United States experienced a mild deflation in May, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI), which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of -0.1 percent in May 2024, down from 3.2 percent in the prior month. The PCEPI has grown 2.5 percent over the last year and 3.8 percent per year since January 2020, just prior to the pandemic. Prices today are 8.9 percentage points higher than they would have been had the Fed hit its 2-percent inflation target over the period.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has also declined. Core PCEPI grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of 1.0 percent in May 2024, down from 3.1 percent in April and 4.0 percent in March. Core PCEPI has grown 2.5 percent over the last year and 3.6 percent per year since January 2020.\n\nFigure 1. Headline and Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index with 2-percent Trend, January 2020 \u2013 May 2024\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested the federal funds rate target range would need to remain at 5.25 to 5.5 percent for longer than had previously been thought. The median FOMC member projected just one 25-basis point rate cut this year, down from three projected back in March. Eight members projected two cuts. Seven members projected one cut. Four members projected zero cuts.\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of FOMC members\u2019 projections of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation numbers bolster the case for lowering the federal funds rate target. As inflation declines, the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate target increases. To prevent the real interest rate from rising, and monetary policy from tightening even further, the FOMC must lower its nominal federal funds rate target.\n\nA numerical example serves to illustrate. Recall that i = r + E(\u1d28), where i is the nominal federal funds rate target, r is the real federal funds rate target, and E(\u1d28) is expected inflation. Suppose one uses the prior month\u2019s core PCEPI inflation reading as a proxy for E(\u1d28). With core inflation at 3.1 percent, as it was two months ago, the Fed\u2019s nominal target range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent implies a real target range of 2.15 to 2.4 percent. With core inflation at just 1.0 percent, as it was last month, the implied real target range is 4.25 to 4.5 percent. The FOMC would need to cut its nominal federal funds rate target by 2.1 percentage points just to leave the real target range unchanged.\n\nWhile illustrative, the numerical example admittedly oversimplifies the problem. The FOMC doesn\u2019t really know how much inflation expectations have declined, nor how much it would need to adjust its nominal federal funds rate target range to prevent the real target range from rising. Still, the direction of the change required by the numerical example seems correct. When the FOMC set the current target range in July 2023, the PCEPI was growing 3.3 percent year-on-year. Core PCEPI was growing 4.1 percent. Both of those rates have since declined to 2.5 percent. Inflation is 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points lower, but the federal funds rate target range is unchanged.\n\nOf course, what ultimately matters for judging the stance of monetary policy is not the level of the real federal funds rate but rather the difference between the real federal funds rate and the so-called natural rate, r*. If r > r*, monetary policy is tight. If r = r*, monetary policy is neutral. If r < r*, monetary policy is loose.\n\nWe do not observe r*, but the New York Fed estimates it was 0.83 to 1.34 in 2023:Q2. In 2024:Q1, the latest quarter for which data is available, it was estimated at 0.7 to 1.18. Hence, the natural rate of interest is thought to have declined 0.13 to 0.16 percentage points in the time since the FOMC set its current target range, which - on its own - would increase the spread between the real federal funds rate and the corresponding natural rate, thereby tightening policy.\n\nFalling inflation likely means that the implied real federal funds rate target range has increased over the last eleven months. Estimates of the natural rate have also declined. Together, lower inflation and a lower natural rate of interest imply that the spread between the natural rate and the implied real federal funds rate target has grown. In other words, monetary policy has gotten tightener. Given the progress made on inflation and the current stance of monetary policy, it makes sense for the Fed to begin cutting its federal funds rate target. It must return policy to neutral, to avoid putting the economy in reverse.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

        "body": "The Nasdaq-100 tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The index is heavily weighted toward the technology sector, and it includes some of the most innovative companies in the world.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 returned 18% during the first half of 2024 due to excitement about artificial intelligence (AI). Investors showed a particular preference for two AI semiconductor stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) led the Nasdaq-100 higher, with shares soaring 150% and 122%, respectively, during the first half.\n\nWall Street is less optimistic about their prospects in the second half, especially where Arm is concerned. Nvidia carries a median price target of $128 per share, which implies 3% upside from its current price of $124 per share. But Arm carries a median price target of $120 per share, implying 28% downside from its current price of $167 per share.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia: The market leader in data center GPUs and AI processors\n\nNvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). The company accounted for 92% of data center GPU sales last year, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia has further entrenched its GPUs as the industry standard in AI computing by branching into other hardware markets. Its networking solutions recently surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion. And its Grace central processing unit (CPU) -- Nvidia's first data center server CPU -- is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nNvidia also provides subscription software and cloud services that help developers train large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning models (MLMs), and build all sorts of AI applications. That portion of its business recently surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. Nvidia has a nearly insurmountable economic moat in its ability to pair superior hardware with software and services that support AI projects, according to analysts.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at 33% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends January 2028). In that context, the current valuation of 69 times earnings is less expensive than it looks. Those numbers give a PEG ratio -- the price-to-earnings multiple divided by forecasted-earnings growth -- of 2.1, which is a substantial discount to the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nStory continues\n\nI have been a Nvidia shareholder since 2017, and I am happy with my position size. But if my portfolio lacked Nvidia exposure, I would feel comfortable buying a small position today, despite the muted, near-term outlook among Wall Street analysts.\n\nArm Holdings: The market leader in smartphone and mobile processors\n\nArm develops and licenses CPU products and development tools to clients like Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Those companies use Arm technology to design custom chips and systems that address various use cases. For instance, Arm Cortex processors are optimized for smartphones and mobile devices, while its Neoverse processors are optimized for cloud-computing workloads like artificial intelligence.\n\nEvery processor has an instruction-set architecture that defines how the hardware and software interact. Arm architecture has historically been associated with power efficiency, so Arm holds 99% market share in smartphones and over 60% market share in other mobile devices. But the x86 architecture used by Intel and AMD has historically been associated with computational performance, so those companies dominate the PC and data center markets.\n\nHowever, while Intel and AMD have failed to gain ground in the mobile-processor market, Arm has improved the computational performance of its CPUs and gained market share across consumer electronics and cloud computing. For example, Apple M-series chips and Amazon Graviton processors are built on Arm architecture, as are Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Grace Blackwell Superchips.\n\nArm reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), beating guidance on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 47% to $928 million, and non-GAAP net income improved to $0.36 per diluted share, up from $0.02 per diluted share in the prior year. But management expects momentum to slow. Guidance implies 22% revenue growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Arm to grow adjusted EPS at 23% annually through fiscal 2028 (ends March 2028). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 131 times earnings look outrageously expensive. Remember how Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 2.1? Well, Arm has a PEG ratio of 5.7.\n\nArm is an excellent business with compelling growth prospects. Wall Street may or may not be correct about Arm shares declining sharply in the coming months. but I plan to avoid this stock until it trades at a cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "AI's Growth Potential Has Helped Power a More Than 140% Rally for This Surprising Stock. Does It Still Have Fuel to Keep Heading Higher?",
        "body": "AI is a game-changing technology. It can significantly boost productivity and reduce costs. That's driving companies to pour billions of dollars into buying AI chips to train models and power applications.\n\nThe AI investment frenzy has driven up semiconductor stocks like Nvidia. However, chip sellers aren't the only ones benefiting from the AI boom. One potential beneficiary that might come as a surprise is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The leading nuclear power producer's stock has surged over 140% in the past year. Here's a look at what's fueling that rally and whether the power producer's stock can keep rising.\n\nAI needs data and power\n\nAI applications have several major requirements. They need an enormous amount of data to train AI models and a tremendous amount of power to run the specialized chips developed by companies like Nvidia. These catalysts are driving growing demand for data centers to house AI servers and processes.\n\nData centers are power-hungry facilities. They consume 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical office building. Meanwhile, AI data centers use even more power. For example, a generative AI search uses four to five times more computing power than a standard search. That drives the view that AI could cause a more than 160% increase in data center power demand by 2030, growing their consumption from 1%-2% of global usage to 3%-4%.\n\nThis surge in power demand is coming at a time when the world is already racing to transition from fossil fuels to lower-emissions alternatives. It could accelerate the already robust demand for renewables. However, renewable energy can't carry this entire load on its own. More intermittent power sources like wind and solar will need help from baseload power producers like natural gas and nuclear energy.\n\nThat's where Constellation Energy comes into play. It's the country's largest producer of carbon-free energy due mainly to its leading nuclear fleet. The company could benefit from increasing demand for nuclear energy to power data centers in the coming years. That has helped fuel its massive rally over the past year.\n\nPowerful growth ahead\n\nConstellation Energy is working to capture the AI power opportunity. The company's CEO, Joseph Dominguez, recently commented that:\n\nWe're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large -- well-known companies that you all know -- about powering their needs... While we're not done yet, I do expect that we will finalize agreements that will have long-term and transformational value.\n\nStory continues\n\nSigning power purchase agreements with large technology companies to power their AI data centers would supply Constellation with increasingly visible income from its existing plants. That would add to the company's already robust earnings growth outlook. Constellation Energy expects to grow its base earnings by more than 10% annually through 2028.\n\nThat outlook also doesn't include new expansion opportunities that could arise when AI accelerates power demand. Constellation Energy could secure additional opportunities to invest in renewable energy and storage projects. It could also provide new opportunities for investing in nuclear energy. For example, the company is looking into adding new small modular reactors and other technologies to help deliver more baseload energy to data centers.\n\nA look at what's left in the fuel tank\n\nWhile Constellation Energy has a lot of growth potential, that doesn't necessarily mean it will have plenty of power to continue rallying. Shares of the lower carbon energy producer currently trade at a forward P/E ratio of more than 28.5 times. That's pretty expensive, especially for a utility stock. It trades closer to the level of the fast-growing Nasdaq-100 index (nearly 29 times forward P/E). That's much more expensive than the broader market (the S&P 500's forward P/E is around 22 times) and other large utilities (they trade at 15 to 22 times forward P/E, though they are growing slower than Constellation at a mid-single-digit rate).\n\nThe current AI craze could continue driving up shares of Constellation Energy, especially if it inks contracts to supply nuclear power to AI data centers. However, it trades at a lofty valuation. Because of that, if AI power contracts fail to materialize or it hits an unexpected speed bump, shares could cool off quickly. That's why investors might want to put Constellation Energy on their watch list for now and consider another utility with AI-powered growth potential instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "A powerful start to 2024 had the bulls predicting $100,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} at some point this year, but relentless selling pressure during April and June (interrupted by a May bounce) has the price struggling not to drop below $60,000 as the quarter draws to a close.\n\nEntering the second quarter, bitcoin was trading just shy of the $71,000 level and at press time (about 60 hours before Q2 officially closes) was changing hands at $60,800, a decline of more than 14%. Helped by the tailwind of what now appears to be certain spot ETF approval, ether {{ETH}} outperformed, but was still in the red in the second quarter with about a 5% drop.\n\nDragged down by even larger declines in many altcoins, the broader CoinDesk Index fell more than 21% during the last three months. Among the movers, Solana {{SOL}} tumbled 30%, Ripple's {{XRP}} dropped 23% and Dogecoin {{DOGE}} plunged 42%. The index's best performer was the above-mentioned ether with its 5% slide.\n\nPositive catalysts vanish\n\nBitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from January 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-March of this year.\n\nAnticipation of the spot bitcoin ETF approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise. Also in play were macro factors \u2013 namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation, however, has failed to cooperate, and to date there has been no easing of monetary policy in the U.S., with more than one member of the central bank now not expecting to cut rates even once this year.\n\nWith ETF inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.\n\nMore pain in store in Q3?\n\nBitcoin entered a downtrend on June 20, writes Markus Thielen at 10X Research, laying out ten reasons why the price could decline to $55,000 in the near term. Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.\n\nIn addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor Donald Trump \u2013 who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin \u2013 Thielen suggested President Biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement Democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the November election.\n\nStory continues\n\nThielen also reminded about seasonality. The third quarter has historically been the weakest one, with an average return of just 5% over the past 13 years. This compares to average returns above 60% in both the second and fourth quarters.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Jamie Dimon says schools are making his job harder by not giving students the proper training to enter the working world",
        "body": "The leader of America's biggest bank wants to see schools doing more to bring students up to pace with the working world, instead of leaving it to businesses to bridge the gap.\n\nJamie Dimon has long been an advocate of getting younger people into well-paid positions, and believes schools should be monitored on whether their students launch careers after they graduate as opposed to whether they go to college.\n\nThis week Dimon\u2014who oversees more than 240,000 employees worldwide\u2014doubled down on that stance.\n\n\"Businesses have to hire a lot of people and they have to train them, so when the school system doesn't do it, it makes this harder for companies,\" he told Axios in an interview released Thursday.\n\n\"What you need in a lot of these things is, certificates and training that get them the good job.\"\n\nDimon\u2014who was paid a record $36 million for his work in 2023\u2014also pushed back on the notion that his work to get younger people and underrepresented communities into the workplace is a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) exercise.\n\nThe Harvard Business School graduate was speaking in relation to his position as the executive chairman of the New York Jobs CEO Council\u2014a coalition of some of the largest employers in the Big Apple.\n\nAlso on the board are Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nA father of three, Dimon rejected the implication that his work on the council was linked to DEI\u2014a topic that has split opinion among the nation's top CEOs.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase chairman said he was \"not interested in labels\" and added that the jobs council had \"nothing to do with DEI.\"\n\n\"This has to do with the system isn't working and needs to be fixed,\" he said. \"It is part of our job [as CEOs and companies] to lift up society. You call that whatever you want\u2026 If we leave behind whole parts of society, we're making a huge mistake for our country.\"\n\nJudging school quality\n\nDimon's sentiments echo thoughts he shared earlier this year about what factors should be considered when establishing whether a school is of good quality.\n\nHe told Indianapolis-based WISH-TV in March: \u201cIf you look at kids they gotta be educated to get jobs. Too much focus in education has been on graduating college\u2026 It should be on jobs. I think the schools should be measured on, did the kids get out and get a good job?\"\n\nDimon pointed out that a 17-year-old bank teller could make $40,000 a year, adding: \u201cAnd if you happen to have a family at 18 or whatever, you get $20,000 in medical benefit for your family. You can be a welder, you can be a coder, you could be cyber, you could be automotive\u2014all of those jobs are $40,000 to $60,000, $70,000 a year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cJobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Dimon repeated. \u201cThere are a lot of efforts taking place around the country but I think we\u2019ve fallen behind as a nation.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nIt seems students themselves are also thinking differently about what they want to get out of their education.\n\nEducation data specialists National Clearing House reported in January that undergraduate enrollment grew 1.2% in the fall of 2023\u2014the first time since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBut within that picture is significant growth in vocational subjects\u2014courses designed to help students learn in a practical way to prepare them for a skills-based role.\n\nThe database reported that at community colleges with a high vocational program focus, enrollment grew 16% in the same period, bringing them above fall 2019 levels.\n\nAs Sam Pillar, cofounder and CEO at Jobber, wrote for Fortune earlier this month: \"Homes and other infrastructure are getting older. Today, the median owner-occupied home in the U.S. is 40 years old, which means there\u2019s a growing need for repairs, maintenance, and remodeling of the aging housing stock.\n\n\"At the same time, skilled workers are retiring, and there aren\u2019t enough young people coming into the trades to take their place\u2026 This leads to delays in service and drives up the cost for consumers. The labor shortage is a major problem but also a massive opportunity for ambitious young people to come in and fill the gap. Thankfully, we\u2019re seeing Gen Z show an interest in seizing this opportunity.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Prediction: These Could Be the Best-Performing Healthcare Stocks Through 2030",
        "body": "Believe it or not, we're nearly halfway through this decade. The healthcare sector could be in store for monumental changes over the next few years.\n\nThese changes should present great opportunities for investors to make money. But where should they put their money? I predict these could be the best-performing healthcare stocks through 2030 (listed by descending market cap).\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) already ranks among the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. It has built a market cap of over $120 billion on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. But I think Vertex's growth prospects through the rest of the decade will come from non-CF therapies.\n\nThe big drugmaker already has one product outside of CF on the market. Vertex is ramping up the commercial launch of Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is a one-time functional cure for these two rare blood diseases.\n\nI predict that Vertex will add three other blockbuster drugs that don't treat CF to its lineup by 2030. It seems likely to win U.S. approval of suzetrigine (VX-548) in moderate-to-severe acute pain next year. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 clinical study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Vertex's acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences will give it a late-stage candidate targeting another kidney disease, IgA nephropathy.\n\nDon't be surprised if Vertex achieves major milestones in curing type 1 diabetes over the next few years. The company has two experimental islet cell therapies in phase 1/2 testing that hold tremendous potential in curing the disease that affects roughly 3.8 million individuals in North America and Europe.\n\n2. Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't have an approved product on the market yet. However, its market cap of around $5.2 billion underscores investors' excitement about Viking's pipeline.\n\nThe huge stock gain for Viking in 2024 is primarily due to positive news for its experimental obesity drug, VK2735. Earlier this year, Viking announced impressive results from a phase 2 study of VK2735. The drug achieved greater weight loss after 13 weeks than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nObesity isn't the only big market Viking is going after. A few weeks ago, the company reported positive results from a phase 2 study evaluating VK2809 in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is also known as metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Some analysts project that NASH/MASH could top $100 billion by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not all. Viking also has two early stage programs. It reported promising results in March for an oral version of VK2735. The company is evaluating VK0214 in a phase 1b study targeting X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a rare genetic disorder.\n\n3. TransMedics Group\n\nI don't think the list of big healthcare winners through 2030 will be limited to only biotech stocks. TransMedics Group (NASDAQ: TMDX) could be one of the top-performing medical device stocks through the rest of this decade and beyond. Its market cap of roughly $4.8 billion doesn't reflect the company's potential, in my view.\n\nTransMedics is revolutionizing the organ transplant market. With the current standard of care (using coolers for transportation), most donated hearts, lungs, and livers don't make it to their intended recipient. TransMedics' OCS (Organ Care System) technology keeps organs functioning during transportation. The result: Significantly higher utilization and reduction of severe post-transplant complications.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for TransMedics has been the lack of availability of airplanes to transport organs. That won't be much of a problem going forward, though. The company acquired a charter plane operator and has built its own fleet of aircraft.\n\nI predict TransMedics' OCS will become the standard of care in organ transplants. I also believe the company will expand the size of the U.S. transplant market and move into other countries over time. TransMedics could and should have a much larger market cap by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in TransMedics Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in TransMedics Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and TransMedics Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "1. Find your demographic\n\nThe competition is stiff, so finding the right place to sell your clothes will give you the best chance of getting them in front of people who might want to buy them.\n\n\u201cDepop tends to appeal more to gen Z, so it doesn\u2019t really suit the pieces I\u2019m selling, while Vinted has a wide range of buyers of all ages,\u201d says Becky Barnes, a sustainable stylist. \u201cOne of my most successful places for selling shoes and clothes is the local community Facebook page. As a seller, it\u2019s easier because you don\u2019t have to package up and send things \u2013 people almost always want to collect.\u201d\n\n2. Provide clear photos\n\nWhether you show an item on a hanger, or post pictures of you wearing the garment, try to get a selection of clear photos from different angles, with closeups of the fabric, and include a shot of the label and care instructions.\n\nTake them in lighting that shows them as they really are \u2013 Natacha Blanchard from Vinted recommends putting clothes against a white background so their outline is clear.\n\nKirsty Keoghan, global general manager of fashion at eBay, says people selling items on the site can use its background removal tool to create a more attractive image, and its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sellers on eBay can use its its AI-powered listing tool to help with descriptions. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\n3. Be descriptive and honest\n\nUse more keywords than you think you need \u2013 this will help buyers find your items when they search.\n\nBlanchard says: \u201cSometimes the colour does not appear in the photo as it does in real life, so I always pay attention to that.\u201d If it is not possible to take photos in good lighting that shows the true colours, she will point out on the description that the shade is lighter or darker than it looks.\n\nAlways be clear about sizing, too. If something comes up smaller or larger than you would expect, mention it. \u201cInclude your basic measurements \u2013 height, bust, waist and hips \u2013 so people can immediately tell if something will fit,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cIt does take a bit more time, but it\u2019s worth getting the tape measure out and including those key measurements so that people are understanding what they are buying.\u201d\n\nIf there are any defects, scratches or snags, mention these in your post, and include pictures of those parts. \u201cI always try to think about selling as if I were buying \u2013 what would I need to know about an item, what information would I want to see?\u201d says Blanchard.\n\n4. Get the timing right\n\nThink seasonally. \u201cAt this time of year, I would be thinking about selling summer dresses and things that suit the season. In October it would be coats and warmer clothing,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nIf you have had a clearout and really want to shift things quickly, be prepared to go low on prices or you may find it difficult to sell.\n\nThe timing of your post counts, too \u2013 holding off and posting when buyers are actively browsing can ensure your listing appears high on the page and gets more views.\n\n\u201cWe know more people are actively listing on Saturdays, and people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays,\u201d says Blanchard.\n\nView image in fullscreen An expert from Vinted says people have a tendency to buy on Sundays and bank holidays. Photograph: mundissima/Alamy\n\n5. Drip-feed your stock\n\nAfter a wardrobe cull, it can be tempting to put everything online immediately. Instead, it is wise to post a few things each day.\n\nKatie Rowe, who sells clothes on Depop, says: \u201cI post every day to be as consistent as I can to maximise my exposure.\u201d\n\nBarnes agrees: \u201cIf I had 10 items, I wouldn\u2019t upload all in one go to the same platform. I would add two or three a day, every day, just to try to keep myself at the top of the algorithm.\u201d\n\n6. Use bundles and discounts\n\nOn sites such as Vinted and Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items from you.\n\nYou get to choose the percentage you would like to take off when you set up your account. It is attractive to the buyer because, on top of the discount, they will pay less for postage.\n\n\u201cI sometimes make bundle offers through the Depop app, meaning that if a buyer buys two or more items, they can get a percentage off the final price,\u201d says Amber Ramon, a regular seller on Depop.\n\nView image in fullscreen On Depop and Vinted, Depop, you can choose to offer a discount to people who buy several items. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\n7. Be friendly in negotiations\n\nOnline selling frequently requires interaction with buyers.\n\n\u201cVinted, and other platforms, are about individuals, and if you list on Vinted, you have to be ready to engage. Potential buyers might have lots of questions,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cBe prepared for negotiations \u2013 people will try to buy for less. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\n8. Pack and ship well\n\nPack items carefully and make sure they are protected. \u201cSome people like to be creative with their packaging,\u201d says Blanchard. \u201cThat can range from packing really carefully to including a little note when sending items. Everyone has their own approach.\u201d\n\nWhatever yours is, be prompt with packing and sending. If you have happy customers, they may return to your page. But perhaps, more importantly, they will give you positive feedback, which will reassure subsequent buyers that you are trustworthy.\n\nView image in fullscreen Be prompt with packing and sending to ensure you get good feedback on sites such as eBay. Photograph: Alisha Arif/Alamy\n\n9. Check selling fees\n\nListing items is often free on secondhand platforms: eBay recently removed fees for private sellers of pre-owned clothes (sellers and buyers must be in the UK), and many platforms charge buyers, rather than sellers.\n\nFor example, buyers pay a \u201cbuyer protection\u201d fee of between 3% and 8% of the pre-postage price on each Vinted purchase, plus between 30p and 80p.\n\nDepop has a marketplace fee of about 5% plus \u00a31, also charged to buyers. While it does not have a seller\u2019s fee per se, there is a processing charge for payments, the service through which payments are received. Sellers pay 2.9% of the sale price (including postage cost) plus 30p.\n\n10. Check tax requirements\n\nMost people will not have to pay tax on the items they sell online. However, as of January this year, HM Revenue and Customs has required online marketplaces and other \u201cdigital platforms\u201d to collect and report information on how much money their users make.\n\nWebsites in countries that have signed up to rules set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development must gather data on UK-resident sellers and share it with HMRC.\n\nTax experts and sites such as MoneySavingExpert.com say platforms will only report information to HMRC automatically if someone is selling 30 or more items a year, or makes more than the equivalent of \u20ac2,000 a year from this activity (a little under \u00a31,700 at the time of writing).\n\nSeparately, everyone has a trading allowance each tax year, which means they can earn up to \u00a31,000 without paying tax.\n\nHMRC has a tool that lets you check if there is anything you need to do.",

        "title": "All Systems Go For Crane, As Execution And A Growth Pivot Drive A Major Re-Rating (NYSE:CR)",
        "body": "Hramovnick/iStock via Getty Images\n\nI\u2019m not sure I could have asked for much more than what Crane (NYSE:CR) has done since it announced it was splitting Crane and Crane NXT (NXT). Not only did I like that decision, I\u2019ve really liked management\u2019s pivot toward growth opportunities in Process Flow (or PF), it\u2019s new M&A program, and I feel like the messaging to the Street has been on point, not to mention the execution.\n\nThe market has noticed, sending the shares over 60% higher since my last update, handily beating the broader industrial sector and just about any like-for-like rival you care to mention.\n\nI\u2019m clearly a big fan of what management is doing here, and I think a more growth-oriented PF segment and the underlying market growth opportunities in Aerospace and Electronics (or AE) can drive mid-single-digit organic growth and meaningful margin leverage. A lot is already expected in that valuation, though, and while I do see enough reasons to stay positive, this is no longer a hidden gem type of story.\n\nPivoting To Growth And Margins In PF\n\nOnce a somewhat sleep and cyclical fluid handling business (valves, pumps, specialty pipe, et al), Crane has put a fair bit of work into repositioning the PF business toward better growth and margin opportunities. Businesses with more cyclicality, less impressive secular growth potential, and less willingness to pay up for innovation (like oil/gas, energy, and non-residential buildings) have been deprioritized, and management has been getting more active on pricing to better align prices with the value of the offerings.\n\nOn the growth side, Crane is targeting markets like LNG, hydrogen, pharma, water, automation, and what I would call \u201csustainable chemicals\u201d \u2013 chemicals made with different inputs or processes to reduce their carbon footprint and/or use or reduce waste streams.\n\nOpportunities in hydrogen are fairly straightforward, as more industries look to replace traditional fossil fuel inputs with hydrogen, this business should continue to grow (steel companies, for instance, are starting to look into hydrogen and this could drive major growth). Should hydrogen become more relevant in mobility (more likely trucks and trains than passenger vehicles), there\u2019s even more upside. Management has already done a couple of deals to boost its capabilities in hydrogen (not unlike what Dover (DOV) did a little while ago), and this is a credible growth market.\n\nI\u2019m also curious to see what the company will do in areas like pharma and possibly electronics down the line. Management has been developing products with higher specifications to handle the more exacting needs of biologicals (antibodies, et al) production, including recent expansion into products for antibody drug conjugate production, and I think a greater focus on high-spec systems could eventually pave the way to get more involved in electronics as well.\n\nIn the meantime, trends are mixed. As I said in that last article, I expected headwinds in 2024 from end-markets like chemicals, general industrial, non-residential, and pharma, and that\u2019s what has been happening, pushing Crane\u2019s organic growth here to modest contraction in the last two quarters. Orders and backlog are still growing, though, and I think Crane will be fine in 2025.\n\nAE Offers Long-Term Opportunity Beyond Near-Term Noise\n\nAerospace has been one of the hot end-markets in the industrial sector for some time, with many companies (I\u2019m thinking of Eaton (ETN) and Parker Hannifin (PH) among others) spending significant sums on M&A to position themselves for what should be a decade-long run of production growth and then years of high-margin aftermarket sales afterward. Crane is more than just a participant here, and this should be a significant growth driver for years to come.\n\nWhile the long-term aero story remains strong, there have been concerns of late about the near-term risk of further production delays and shortfalls as Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) and Boeing (BA) deal with various issues that are very likely to lead to 2024 production coming in below prior targets. In the case of Crane, though, there really isn\u2019t much risk here \u2013 when near-term production stumbles, Crane can easily shift most of its products from the original equipment market to the aftermarket, where it enjoys higher prices and margins anyway. With narrowbody production disappointing, more older jets have had to remain in service, driving strong aftermarket demand for Crane, Melrose (OTCPK:MLSPF), and others in the market.\n\nOn a related note, I like how Crane takes a platform-agnostic approach to its aerospace product development. There are risks in not partnering on pre-specified programs, but Crane management understates its markets and what its customers need, and this makes the company less tied to specific wins (and/or shortfalls in production of specific aircraft) and less vulnerable on margins, as OEMs will often squeeze suppliers hard for first-fit products.\n\nOriginal equipment sales have been picking up lately, but aftermarket remains very strong and margins continue to grow nicely here (over 22% on a segment level last quarter). With multiple defense programs ramping up (including radar, missile, and aircraft programs), improving narrowbody production, and the real expansion in widebody production still to come, I think management\u2019s target of 7% to 9% growth in aerospace is definitely achievable over the next three to five years.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nWith multiyear strength in aerospace and new growth markets in process flow, I think Crane can grow revenue at a strong mid-single-digit organic pace. This is going to be complemented by an active M&A program, with the company so far sticking to its target of one meaningful deal per quarter (two of which are relevant to emerging opportunities like hydrogen and pharma).\n\nSeeing a few quarters of execution and understanding more about what management is looking to do as it pivots to sustainably higher-margin market opportunities, I\u2019m more confident in that 23% EBITDA margin target for 2028, and I think a 20% EBITDA margin in or before 2026 is pretty likely. With that, I see free cash flow margins moving fairly quickly toward the mid-teens, and there could be some further upside there.\n\nThe problem is that the market already expects that and then some. It\u2019s tricky to model in M&A, but in the case of Crane you pretty much have to or the numbers just don\u2019t work. I\u2019m comfortable with the idea that Crane will see actual reported revenue growth in the double-digits on the back of M&A, but that hardly makes for conservative modeling.\n\nValuation isn\u2019t any simpler with my margin and return-driven EV/EBITDA methodology. Crane\u2019s improving profitability can support an above-average EBITDA multiple, but even a 15x multiple (which includes some credit for above-average top-line growth potential, which the market does reward), I can\u2019t get to an attractive fair value this way.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCrane is a good litmus test for how much an investor emphasizes valuation over story and improving fundamentals. It takes some aggressive assumptions to support a fair value in the $160\u2019s (my discounted cash flow-based fair value estimate), but Crane appears to have an above-average sustainable multiyear growth story, and the market has shown over and over again it will pay for above-average revenue growth and margin leverage.\n\nThere are more risks here now because of the valuation, and I\u2019m more inclined to wait for a pullback, but it\u2019s hard to argue with a company that is delivering beat-and-raise performances and outlining a path to higher sustained growth and margin levels in the years to come.",
